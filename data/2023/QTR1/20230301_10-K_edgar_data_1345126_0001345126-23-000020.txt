PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 Compass Diversified Holdings, a Delaware statutory trust Holdings , or the Trust ), was incorporated in Delaware on November 18, 2005. Compass Group Diversified Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the LLC ), was also formed on November 18, 2005. The Trust and the LLC (collectively, the Company were formed to acquire and manage a group of small and middle-market businesses headquartered in North America. The Trust is the sole owner of 100 of the Trust Interests, as defined in our LLC Agreement, of the LLC. Pursuant to the LLC Agreement, the Trust owns an identical number of Trust Interests in the LLC as exist for the number of outstanding shares of the Trust. 
 The Trust was previously treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes but elected, effective September 1, 2021, to be taxed as an association taxable as a corporation. Following this tax election, Trust shareholders should generally only be subject to taxation from holding Trust shares in connection with disposition of Trust shares and receipt of taxable dividends from the Trust. Trust shareholders subject to tax rules regarding unrelated business taxable income (or UBTI will no longer be allocated UBTI from the Trust. 
 The LLC is the operating entity with a board of directors whose corporate governance responsibilities are similar to that of a Delaware corporation. The LLC s board of directors oversees the management of the Company and our businesses and the performance of Compass Group Management LLC CGM or our Manager ). Certain persons who are employees and partners of our Manager receive a profit allocation as beneficial owners of through Sostratus LLC of the Allocation Interests in us, as defined in our LLC Agreement. 
 
 Overview 
 We acquire controlling interests in and actively manage businesses that we believe (i) operate in industries with long-term macroeconomic growth opportunities, (ii) have positive and stable cash flows, (iii) face minimal threats of technological or competitive obsolescence, and (iv) have strong management teams largely in place. We offer investors a unique opportunity to own a diverse group of leading middle-market businesses in the niche-industrial and branded-consumer sectors. 
 Our disciplined approach to our target markets provides opportunities to methodically purchase attractive businesses at values that are accretive to our shareholders. For sellers of businesses, our unique financial structure allows us to acquire businesses efficiently with little or no third party financing contingencies and, following acquisition, to provide our businesses with substantial access to growth capital. In addition, our permanent capital model and ample liquidity allows us to acquire businesses at any point across economic cycles, ensuring that we are able to act quickly when the opportunity presents itself to do so and that we re not paralyzed when markets are volatile. 
 We believe that private company operators and corporate parents looking to sell their business units may consider us an attractive purchaser because of our ability to: 
 provide ongoing strategic and financial support for their businesses, including professionalization of our subsidiaries at scale; 
 maintain a long-term outlook as to the ownership of those businesses; 
 sustainably invest in growth capital and/or add-on acquisitions where appropriate; and 
 consummate transactions efficiently without being dependent on third-party transaction financing. 
 In particular, we believe that our outlook on length of ownership and active management on our part may alleviate the concern that many private company operators and parent companies may have with regard to their businesses going through multiple sale processes in a short period of time. We believe this outlook enhances our ability to develop a comprehensive strategy to grow the earnings and cash flows of each of our businesses. 
 Finally, it has been our experience, that our ability to acquire businesses without the cumbersome delays and conditions typical of third party transactional financing is appealing to sellers of businesses who are interested in confidentiality, speed and certainty to close. 
 We believe our management team s strong relationships with industry executives, accountants, attorneys, business brokers, commercial and investment bankers, and other potential sources of acquisition opportunities offer us substantial opportunities to assess small to middle market businesses available for acquisition. In addition, the 
 6 

flexibility, creativity, experience and expertise of our management team in structuring transactions allows us to consider non-traditional and complex transactions tailored to fit a specific acquisition target. 
 In terms of the businesses in which we have a controlling interest as of December 31, 2022, we believe that these businesses have strong management teams, operate in strong markets with defensible market niches, and maintain long-standing customer relationships. 
 We categorize the businesses we own into two separate groups (i) branded consumer businesses and, (ii) niche industrial businesses. Branded consumer businesses are those businesses that we believe capitalize on a valuable brand name in their respective market sector. We believe that our branded consumer businesses are leaders in their particular product categories. Niche industrial businesses are those businesses that focus on manufacturing and selling products and industrial services within a specific market sector. We believe that our niche industrial businesses are leaders in their specific market sectors. In 2022, we announced that we will consider potential acquisitions in a third industry category - healthcare. Healthcare has multiple attractive, high-growth sectors with strong barriers to entry and advantageous demographic trends. 
 The following is a brief summary of the businesses in which we own a controlling interest at December 31, 2022:

 Tax Reporting 
 On August 3, 2021, the shareholders of CODI approved amendments to the Second Amended and Restated Trust Agreement of the Trust and the Fifth Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of the Company to allow the Company s Board of Directors (the Board to cause the Trust to elect to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (the tax reclassification and, at its discretion in the future, cause the Trust to be converted to a corporation. Following the shareholder vote, the Board resolved to cause the Trust to elect to be treated as a 
 9 

corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Trust was taxed as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes since January 1, 2007 and until the tax reclassification became effective on September 1, 2021. 
 The Trust will be treated as a corporation for any taxable period beginning on or after the tax reclassification. Income, gain, loss, deduction and credit from the Trust will no longer be passed through to the Trust shareholders. The Trust issued its final Schedule K-1s for the taxable period beginning January 1, 2021 and ending August 31, 2021, the last day on which the Trust was treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Trust will be required to file Form 1120, U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return on an annual basis and for all taxable periods beginning on or after the tax reclassification. In addition, distribution with respect to Trust shares (including Trust preferred shares) will now be reported on Form 1099-DIV, instead of on Schedule K-1.

Our Manager 
 Our Manager, CGM, has been engaged to manage the day-to-day operations and affairs of the Company and to execute our strategy, as discussed below. Collectively, our management team has extensive experience in acquiring and managing small and middle market businesses. We believe our Manager is unique in the marketplace in terms of the success and experience of its employees in acquiring and managing diverse businesses of the size and general nature of our businesses. We believe this experience will provide us with an advantage in executing our overall strategy. Our management team devotes substantially all of its time to the affairs of the Company. 
 We have entered into a management services agreement, (the Management Services Agreement or MSA pursuant to which our Manager manages the day-to-day operations and affairs of the Company and oversees the management and operations of our businesses. We pay our Manager a quarterly management fee for the services 
 11 

it performs on our behalf. In addition, certain persons who are employees and partners of our Manager receive a profit allocation with respect to its Allocation Interests in us. All of the Allocation Interests in us are owned by Sostratus LLC. Payment of profit allocations to Sostratus LLC can occur for each of our subsidiaries during the -day period following the fifth anniversary of the date upon which we acquired a controlling interest in that business (a "Holding Event") to the extent contribution based profit has been earned, and upon the sale of a subsidiary from which there is a realizable gain (a "Sale Event"). See Part III, Item 13 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence for further descriptions of the management fees and profit allocations. 
 The Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are employees of our Manager and have been seconded to us. Neither the Trust nor the LLC has any other employees. Although our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are employees of our Manager, they report directly to the LLC s board of directors. The management fee paid to our Manager covers all expenses related to the services performed by our Manager, including the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and other personnel providing services to us. The LLC reimburses our Manager for the compensation and related costs and expenses of our Chief Financial Officer and his staff, who dedicate substantially all of their time to the affairs of the Company. 
 See Part III, Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions, and Director Independence . 
 Market Opportunity 
 We acquire and actively manage small and middle market businesses. We characterize small to middle market businesses as those that generate annual cash flows of up to 100 million per year. We believe that the acquisition market for these businesses is highly fragmented and often provides opportunities to purchase at more attractive prices and achieve better outcomes for our shareholders. We believe this is driven by the following factors: 
 third-party financing for these acquisitions is often less available or terms are less favorable for the borrower; 
 sellers of these businesses frequently consider non-economic factors, such as legacy or the effect of the sale on their employees; 
 these businesses are more likely to be sold outside of an auction process or as part of a limited process; and 
 "add-on" acquisitions can often be completed at attractive multiples of cash flow. 
 Frequently, opportunities exist to support and augment existing management at such businesses and improve the performance of these businesses upon their acquisition through active management. We are business builders rather than asset traders. In the past, our management team has acquired businesses that were owned by entrepreneurs or large corporate parents. In these cases, our management team has frequently found opportunities to profitably invest in areas of the acquired businesses beyond levels that existed at the time of acquisition. In addition, our management team has frequently found that processes such as financial reporting and management information systems of acquired businesses may be improved, leading to improvements in reporting and operations and ultimately earnings and cash flow. Finally, our management team often acts as a business development arm for our businesses to pursue organic or external growth strategies that may not have been pursued by their previous owners. 
 
 Our Strategy 
 CODI s permanent capital structure enables us to invest in people, processes, culture, and growth opportunities that drive transformational change. We have two primary strategies that we use to support long-term value creation. First, we focus on growing the earnings and cash flow from our acquired businesses and help them professionalize at scale. We believe that the scale and scope of our businesses give us a diverse base of cash flow upon which to further build. Second, we identify, perform due diligence on, negotiate and consummate additional platform acquisitions of small to middle market businesses in attractive industry sectors in accordance with acquisition criteria established by the board of directors. 
 Management Strategy 
 Our management strategy involves the proactive financial and operational management of the businesses we own in order to increase cash flows and shareholder value. Our Manager actively oversees and supports the management teams of each of our businesses by, among other things: 
 12 

recruiting and retaining talented managers to operate our businesses using structured incentive compensation programs, including non-controlling equity ownership, tailored to each business; 
 regularly monitoring financial and operational performance, instilling consistent financial discipline, and supporting management in the development and implementation of information systems to effectively achieve these goals; 
 identifying and aligning with external policy and performance tailwinds such as those influenced by growing climate, health, and social justice concerns (and similar environmental, social and governance ("ESG") drivers); 
 assisting management in their analysis and pursuit of prudent organic growth strategies; 
 identifying and working with management to execute attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities; 
 assisting management in controlling and right-sizing overhead costs; 
 nurturing an internal culture of transparency, alignment, accountability and governance, including regular reporting; 
 professionalizing our subsidiaries at scale; and 
 forming strong subsidiary level boards of directors to supplement management in their development and implementation of strategic goals and objectives. 
 Specifically, while our businesses have different growth opportunities and potential rates of growth, we expect our Manager to work with the management teams of each of our businesses to increase the value of, and cash generated by, each business through various initiatives, including: 
 making selective capital investments to expand geographic reach, increase capacity, or reduce manufacturing costs of our businesses; 
 investing in product research and development for new products, processes or services for customers; 
 improving and expanding existing sales and marketing programs; 
 pursuing reductions in operating costs through improved operational efficiency or outsourcing of certain processes and products; and 
 consolidating or improving management of certain overhead functions. 
 Our businesses typically acquire and integrate complementary businesses. We believe that complementary add-on acquisitions improve our overall financial and operational performance by allowing us to: 
 leverage manufacturing and distribution operations; 
 leverage branding and marketing programs, as well as customer relationships; 
 add experienced management or management expertise; 
 increase market share and penetrate new markets; and 
 realize cost synergies by allocating the corporate overhead expenses of our businesses across a larger number of businesses and by implementing and coordinating improved management practices. 
 Acquisition Strategy 
 Our acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses that we expect to produce stable and growing earnings and cash flow. In this respect, we expect to make platform acquisitions in industries other than those in which our businesses currently operate if we believe an acquisition presents an attractive opportunity. We believe that attractive opportunities will continue to present themselves, as private sector owners seek to monetize their interests in long-standing and privately-held businesses and large corporate parents seek to dispose of their non-core operations. 
 Our ideal acquisition candidate has the following characteristics: 
 is a leading branded consumer or niche industrial company headquartered in North America; 
 maintains highly defensible position in the markets it serves and with customers; 
 operates in an industry with favorable long-term macroeconomic trends; 
 has a strong management team, either currently in place or previously identified, and meaningful incentives; 
 has low technological and/or product obsolescence risk; and 
 maintains a diversified customer and supplier base. 
 13 

In 2022, we announced that we will consider potential acquisitions in a third industry category - healthcare. Healthcare has multiple attractive, high-growth sectors with strong barriers to entry and advantageous demographic trends. We believe acquisitions in the healthcare industry will bring further diversification and earnings stability to our current group of subsidiaries and will have strong alignment with the existing criteria for acquisition candidates. Our Manager hired a head of healthcare who will partner with our existing team to launch our acquisition strategy in the healthcare industry. 
 We benefit from our Manager s ability to identify potential diverse acquisition opportunities in a variety of industries. In addition, we rely upon our management team s experience and expertise in researching and valuing prospective target businesses, as well as negotiating the ultimate acquisition of such target businesses. In particular, because there may be a lack of information available about these target businesses, which may make it more difficult to understand or appropriately value such target businesses, on our behalf, our Manager: 
 engages in a substantial level of internal and third-party due diligence; 
 critically evaluates the target management team; 
 identifies and assesses any financial and operational strengths and weaknesses of the target business; 
 analyzes comparable businesses to assess financial and operational performances relative to industry competitors; 
 actively researches and evaluates information on the relevant industry; and 
 thoroughly negotiates appropriate terms and conditions of any acquisition. 
 The process of acquiring new businesses is both time-consuming and complex. Our management team historically has taken from two to twenty-four months to perform due diligence, negotiate and close acquisitions. Although our management team is at various stages of evaluating several transactions at any given time, there may be periods of time during which our management team does not recommend any new acquisitions to us. Even if an acquisition is recommended by our management team, our board of directors may not approve it. 
 A component of our acquisition financing strategy that we utilize in acquiring the businesses we own and manage is to provide both equity capital and debt capital, raised at the parent company level largely through our existing credit facility. We believe, and it has been our experience, that having the ability to finance our acquisitions with capital resources raised by us, rather than negotiating separate third-party financing, provides us with an advantage in successfully acquiring attractive businesses by minimizing delay and closing conditions that are often related to acquisition-specific financings. In addition, our strategy of providing this intercompany debt financing within the capital structure of the businesses we acquire and manage allows us the ability to distribute cash to the parent company through monthly interest payments and amortization of principle on these intercompany loans. 
 Upon acquisition of a new business, we rely on our Manager s experience and expertise to work efficiently and effectively with the management of the new business to jointly develop and execute a successful business plan. 
 Strategic Advantages 
 Based on the experience of our management team and its ability to identify and negotiate acquisitions, we believe we are well-positioned to acquire additional businesses. Our management team has strong relationships with business brokers, investment and commercial bankers, accountants, attorneys and other potential sources of acquisition opportunities. In addition, our management team has a successful track record of acquiring and managing small-to-middle market businesses in various industries. In negotiating these acquisitions, we believe our management team has been able to successfully navigate complex situations surrounding acquisitions, including corporate spin-offs, transitions of family-owned businesses, management buy-outs and reorganizations. 
 Our management team has a large ne twork that we estimate to be approximately 2,000 deal interme diaries who we expect to expose us to potential acquisitions. Through this network, as well as our management team s proprietary transaction sourcing efforts, we have a substantial pipeline of potential acquisition targets. Our management team also has a well-established network of contacts, including professional managers, attorneys, accountants and other third-party consultants and advisors, who may be available to assist us in the performance of due diligence and the negotiation of acquisitions, as well as the management and operation of our acquired businesses. 
 Finally, because we intend to fund acquisitions through the utilization of our 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, we expect to minimize the delays and closing conditions typically associated with transaction specific financing, as is typically the case in such acquisitions. We believe this advantage can be a powerful one, especially in a tight credit environment, and is highly unusual in the marketplace for acquisitions in which we operate. 
 14 

Valuation and Due Diligence 
 When evaluating businesses or assets for acquisition, our management team performs rigorous due diligence and a financial evaluations process including an evaluation of the operations of the target business and the outlook for its industry. While valuation of a business is a subjective process, we define valuations under a variety of analyses, including: 
 discounted cash flow analyses; 
 evaluation of trading values of comparable companies; 
 expected value matrices; and 
 examination of comparable recent transactions. 
 One outcome of this process is a projection of the expected cash flows from the target business. A further outcome is an understanding of the types and levels of risk associated with those projections. While future performance and projections are always uncertain, we believe that with detailed due diligence, future cash flows will be better estimated and the prospects for operating the business in the future better evaluated. To assist us in identifying material risks and validating key assumptions in our financial and operational analysis, in addition to our own analysis, we engage third-party experts to review key risk areas, including legal, tax, regulatory, accounting, insurance and environmental. We also engage technical, operational or industry consultants, as necessary. 
 A further critical component of the evaluation of potential target businesses is the assessment of the capability of the existing management team, including recent performance, expertise, experience, culture and incentives to perform. Where necessary, and consistent with our management strategy, we actively seek to augment, supplement or replace existing members of management who we believe are not likely to execute our business plan for the target business. Similarly, we analyze and evaluate the financial and operational information systems of target businesses and, where necessary, we enhance and improve those existing systems that are deemed to be inadequate or insufficient to support our business plan for the target business. 
 Environmental, Social and Governance 
 In the last few years, companies, investors and policymakers have focused more attention on - and have made investments in - companies that are considered leaders in ESG practices. We believe that ESG engagement can help drive value creation and have incorporated ESG factors into our investment analysis and decision making. We believe strong ESG practices can be long-term performance enhancing and enable us to oversee and balance the needs of important stakeholders in doing so. We are committed to maintaining responsible investment practices that position our businesses for long-term success. 
 Our long-term responsible approach is also reflected in how we manage ourselves. We have been and remain committed to being a responsible partner to our subsidiaries and are proud stewards of corporate citizenship. 
 Financing 
 We incur third party debt financing almost entirely at the Company level, which we use, in combination with our equity capital, to provide debt financing to each of our businesses and to acquire additional businesses. We believe this financing structure is beneficial to the financial and operational activities of each of our businesses by aligning our interests as both equity holders of, and lenders to, our businesses, in a manner that we believe is more efficient than each of our businesses borrowing from third-party lenders. 
 Debt Financing 
 2022 Credit Facility 
 On July 12, 2022, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to amend and restate the 2021 Credit Facility. The 2022 Credit Facility provides for revolving loans, swing line loans and letters of credit (the "2022 Revolving Credit Facility") up to a maximum aggregate amount of 600 million (the "2022 Revolving Loan Commitment") and a 400 million term loan (the 2022 Term Loan ). The 2022 Term Loan requires quarterly payments ranging from 2.5 million to 7.5 million, commencing September 30, 2022, with a final payment of all remaining principal and interest due on July 12, 2027, which is the 2022 Term Loan s maturity date. All amounts outstanding under the 2022 Revolving Line of Credit will become due on July 12, 2027, which is the termination date of the 2022 Revolving Loan Commitment. The 2022 Credit Facility also permits the LLC, prior to the applicable maturity date, to increase the 2022 Revolving Loan Commitment and/or obtain additional term loans in an 
 15 

aggregate amount of up to 250 million, subject to certain restrictions and conditions. On the closing date for the 2022 Credit Facility, the 2022 Term Loan was advanced in full and the initial borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Revolving Line of Credit were 115 million. We used the initial proceeds from the 2022 Credit Facility to pay all amounts outstanding under the 2021 Credit Facility, pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the 2022 Credit Facility and fund the acquisition of PrimaLoft. 
 The 2022 Credit Facility provides for letters of credit under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate face amount not to exceed 100 million outstanding at any time, as well as swing line loans of up to 25 million outstanding at one time. At no time may the (i) aggregate principal amount of all amounts outstanding under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, plus (ii) the aggregate amount of all outstanding letters of credit and swing line loans, exceed the borrowing availability under the 2022 Credit Facility. At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 2.2 million. The borrowing availability under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility at December 31, 2022 was approximately 442.8 million. 
 The 2022 Credit Facility is secured by all of the assets of the Company, including all of its equity interests in, and loans to, its consolidated subsidiaries. (See " Note I - Debt " to the consolidated financial statements for more detail regarding our 2022 Credit Facility). 
 Senior Notes 
 On November 17, 2021, we consummated the issuance and sale of 300 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.000 Notes due 2032 (the "2032 Notes") offered pursuant to a private offering to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and to non-U.S. persons under Regulation S under the Securities Act. The 2032 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of November 17, 2021 (the 2032 Notes Indenture ), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The 2032 Notes bear interest at the rate of 5.000 per annum and will mature on January 15, 2032. Interest on the 2032 Notes is payable in cash on July 15th and January 15th of each year. The 2032 Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and are not guaranteed by our subsidiaries. The proceeds from the sale of the 2032 Notes was used to repay debt outstanding under the 2021 Credit Facility. 
 On March 23, 2021, we consummated the issuance and sale of 1,000 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.250 Notes due 2029 (the "2029 Notes") offered pursuant to a private offering to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and to non-U.S. persons under Regulation S under the Securities Act. The 2029 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of March 23, 2021 (the 2029 Notes Indenture ), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The 2029 Notes bear interest at the rate of 5.250 per annum and will mature on April 15, 2029. Interest on the 2029 Notes is payable in cash on April 15th and October 15th of each year. The 2029 Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and are not guaranteed by our subsidiaries. 
 The proceeds from the sale of the 2029 Notes was used to repay debt outstanding under the 2018 Credit Facility in connection with our entry into the 2021 Credit Facility, and to redeem our 8.000 Senior Notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes ). 
 Equity Financing 
 Trust Common Shares 
 The Trust is authorized to issue 500,000,000 Trust common shares and the Company is authorized to issue a corresponding number of LLC interests. The Company will, at all times have an equal amount of LLC interests outstanding as Trust shares. At December 31, 2022, there were 72.2 million Tr ust common shares outstanding. 
 At-the market program 
 On September 7, 2021, we filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to which we may, but we have no obligation to, issue and sell up to 500 million shares of the common shares of the Trust in amounts and at times to be determined by us. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including, market conditions, the trading price of Trust common shares and determinations by us regarding appropriate sources of funding. In connection with this offering, we entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc. B. Riley and Goldman Sachs Co. LLC Goldman pursuant to which we may sell common shares of the Trust having an aggregate offering price of up to 500 million, from time to time through B. Riley and Goldman, acting as sales agents and/or principals. We s old 3,464,844 and 3,837,885 Tru st common shares during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and received net proceeds of 
 16 

approxi mately 83.9 million and 115.1 million. We incurred approximate ly 1.5 million and 2.1 million in co mmissions payable to the Sales Agents during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Trust Preferred Shares 
 The Trust is authorized to issue up to 50,000,000 million Trust preferred shares and the Company is authorized to issue a corresponding number of Trust Interests. We issued 4,000,000 7.250 Series A Preferred Shares in 2017, 4,000,000 7.875 Series B Preferred Shares in 2018 and 4,600,000 7.875 Series C Preferred Shares in 2019. 
 We intend to finance future acquisitions through our 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, cash on hand and, if necessary, additional equity and debt financings. We believe, and it has been our experience, that having the ability to finance our acquisitions with the capital resources raised by us, rather than negotiating separate third party financing specifically related to the acquisition of individual businesses, provides us with an advantage in acquiring attractive businesses by minimizing delay and closing conditions that are often related to acquisition-specific financings. In this respect, we believe that in the future, we may need to pursue additional debt or equity financings, or offer equity in Holdings or target businesses to the sellers of such target businesses, in order to fund multiple future acquisitions. 
 
 Our Businesses 
 We categorize the businesses we own into two separate groups of businesses (i) branded consumer businesses, and (ii) niche industrial businesses. Branded consumer businesses are characterized as those businesses that we believe capitalize on a valuable brand name in their respective market sector. We believe that our branded consumer businesses are leaders in their particular product category. Niche industrial businesses are characterized as those businesses that focus on manufacturing and selling particular products and industrial services within a specific market sector. We believe that our niche industrial businesses are leaders in their specific market sector.

 History of 5.11 
 5.11's heritage dates back to the 1970 s when 5.11 pants were originally designed by Royal Robbins for elite rock climbers. These climbers wanted durable yet flexible and comfortable pants as they scaled the most extreme rock walls in Yosemite National Park. In the early 1990 s, the same 5.11 pant was adopted by the F.B.I. National Academy and became standard training issue because of its superior design and performance. Trusted by law enforcement and military professionals ever since, 5.11's innovative products have formed the cornerstone of the brand. 5.11 is an outfitter of choice for our heroes who require rugged, functional, durable, and technically-advanced products capable of withstanding harsh conditions without sacrificing comfort.

 Customers and Distribution Channels 
 Management believes the brand s empowering message, innovative product quality, and technically advanced designs appeal to a broad and growing consumer base. Based on the cross-over appeal of its products, 5.11 consumers fall into two core groups, professional Prosumers and Everyday Consumers. The 5.11 community was initially built by Prosumers, which consists of groups such as U.S. military personnel, law enforcement, first responders, and frontline workers, who require unwavering durability and reliability, but also value the design and 
 19 

comfort of the 5.11 products, providing the versatility to wear its products both on and off duty. Over time, 5.11 has expanded its reach into functionally focused Everyday Consumers, who, management believes, are inspired by Prosumers to live a life bigger than themselves and share the always be ready "ABR" mindset. 5.11 products resonate with a diverse group of Prosumers and Consumers, laying the foundation for continued expansion of a loyal and engaged consumer base into the future. 
 Everyday Consumers: A blend of active, challenge-seeking and achievement-oriented gear consumers who thrive on fitness and adventure. Inspired by 5.11 s Prosumers to live a life bigger than themselves with the Always Be Ready mindset, these Everyday Consumers engage in a range of activities from fitness and training, to outdoor experiences such as hunting, hiking and overlanding, and purchase 5.11 products for everyday casual use. They prioritize maintaining high performance and, we believe, recognize that the functional superiority of 5.11 products aligns with their own achievement-oriented goals. They also appreciate the aesthetic and functional design of 5.11 products, which can take them from the comfort of their home to a favorite nearby hike, as well as 5.11 apparel, footwear and gear, which are as dynamic as they are. We believe the Everyday Consumers align with 5.11 products price points and superior value proposition. 
 Prosumers: Includes everyone from the most elite U.S. military and law enforcement special forces units on the planet to everyday heroes including first responders, frontline workers, and other professionals, both on duty in mission-critical situations and off-duty. Prosumers are devoted to service, on and off-the-clock, and 5.11 endeavors to match their dedication and commitment as it produces superior technical products for every aspect of their lives. 5.11 s unique combination of durability, functional excellence, and comfort allows Prosumers to turn to 5.11 seamlessly across a variety of use-cases, whether on-duty, training, spending a weekend overlanding, backpacking, or camping. Many of the Prosumers are never fully off-duty, making the ability to serve them comfortably and reliably in all aspects of their lives a top priority. 5.11 enables them to Always Be Ready to meet any challenges that cross their path. 
 The strength of the 5.11 business model is the ability to serve the consumer however they prefer to engage while simultaneously reinforcing the 5.11 brand s premium association and authenticity. Rather than taking the traditional channel approach to the business which management believes limits 5.11's potential, 5.11 enters a trade area with the right mix of owned stores, Consumer Wholesale, Professional Wholesale, eCommerce and marketplaces. By approaching trade areas in this manner, 5.11 shares inventory between stores and eCommerce and optimizes speed and efficiency with logistics that meet consumers needs wherever they prefer to shop, rather than directing them into a particular channel. This principle of product accessibility and experiential shopping drives brand building and organic lead generation. Though each channel is able to function profitability on an individual basis, the value derived from these channels working in concert is a unique competitive strength 5.11 employs in every market in which it operates. 
 Direct to Consumer - 5.11 s DTC channel is comprised of its digital platform, 511tactical.com, its growing network of retail stores as well as its third-party marketplace partners. 5.11 has significantly expanded its DTC mix in the past five years, with DTC now co mprising 43 , 43 and 39 of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 5.11 s website has grown significantly and drives a significant portion of its online sales. 5.11 also operates 110 company owned retail stores in 33 states, with plans to grow its footprint further. Both the online and company owned retail stores enable 5.11 to maintain direct relationships with consumers, influence the brand experience and better understand shopping preferences and behavior. 
 eCommerce. 5.11 has grown its e-commerce substantially in the last few years, which has been enabled by continued investment in digital infrastructure capabilities, enhanced consumer experience through increased customization and curation, and a growing global supply chain. Since 2017, 5.11 has invested heavily in capabilities to further its e-commerce infrastructure, including a scalable ERP system and new locations that enable more cost effective and timely delivery for its e-commerce orders. 
 Retail. Since 2011, 5.11 has grow n to 110 bran ded and owned retail locations around the U.S. as of December 31, 2022. Its locations provide an opportunity for 5.11 to showcase its diverse product assortment. Retail also provides an opportunity to further engage with consumers through the ABR mindset, with in-person, local community events and educational opportunities that elevate the experiential retail experience. 
 Third-party marketplaces. 5.11 s third-party marketplace partners, such as Amazon, are invaluable tools for its omnichannel presence. The collaboration with the some of the largest retailers brings 5.11 increased opportunity from sales and revenue to increased marketing opportunities and brand awareness. Yet at the 
 20 

same time, 5.11 is strategic about protecting its 5.11 brand and delivering a consistent consumer experience in the third-party marketplace. 
 Wholesale - The Wholesale channel is comprised of Professional Wholesale, Consumer Wholesale and International business. Wholesale sales were 57 , 57 and 61 of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Professional Wholesa le channel specializes in demand creation for formal procurement through specification of 5.11 on government contracts around the world. The Consumer Wholesale channel is comprised of dealers, outdoor specialty retailers, and military exchanges, serving predominantly Everyday Consumers. The International business includes retail locations and International e-commerce sites. International products are currently distributed in over 120 countries across the globe. Management believes there is significant opportunity for continued International expansion. 
 Professional Wholesale. The Professional Wholesale channel consists of Prosumer sales relationships, and is comprised of dealers and resellers of 5.11 technical apparel, footwear and gear through governmental departments and agencies, including their retail front and e-commerce services that cater to Prosumers that need additional services, such as tailoring of their uniforms, in a one-stop-shop experience. Requirements of outfitting entire agencies or departments necessitates carrying numerous, often infrequently used, sizes and colors of a given product. In addition, 5.11 s years of handling these types of customized orders has resulted in 5.11 having a dedicated team with specialized expertise, a skillset that is unique in the industry. We believe 5.11 s significant investment in inventory provides a competitive advantage versus smaller less well capitalized competitors that carry low levels of inventory. 
 Consumer Wholesale. The Consumer Wholesale channel consists of Everyday Consumer sales relationships, and is comprised of third-party retailers and their e-commerce sites. 5.11 consumers can find its products at well-known big box sports, outdoor specialty retailers and military exchanges, in addition to third-party online only retailers who focus on product sales in similar apparel, footwear and gear categories as we do. Shop-in-shop concepts at key retailers who also attract the 5.11 customer base gives consumers a tactile experience with 5.11 products, by which they can feel, try on, and compare 5.11 product offerings. Additionally, 5.11 gains online traction from discussion boards and forums that bring professional and everyday enthusiasts together to discuss 5.11 products and the category in general. Both avenues serve as catalysts to attract new customers and keep long time consumers loyal to the 5.11 brand. 
 International. In addition to domestic whitespace, management believes there is opportunity to expand internationally as International only represente d 21 of net sales in 2022. While 5.11 products are currently distributed in 120 countries across the globe, 5.11 has limited penetration in many of these countries with limited distribution in certain countries and certain dealers only carrying select styles. As such, management believes there is significant opportunity for continued international expansion and plan to expand in Europe, the Middle East, Africa ("EMEA"), Mexico, Asia, Australia, and Canada, and will leverage third-party logistics facilities in Europe and China as well as 5.11 s owned warehouse in Australia to drive this. 5.11 sees additional opportunities to further expand internationally and plan to methodically continue the expansion of its business. 
 No individual customer represented greater than 10 of 5.11 s net revenues in 2022. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, 5.11 had approximately 41.3 million and 40.7 million, resp ectively, in firm backlog. 
 Market Opportunities 
 5.11 products are designed for use in a wide variety of activities, from professional to recreational and outdoor and indoor, and can be used all year long. As a result, the markets and consumers 5.11 serves are broad and deep. The market opportunity is both significant and supported by the demand of 5.11 s innovative products providing an opportunity for future, profitable growth. As a category-defining brand, management believes its innovative products serving Everyday Consumers and Prosumers will continue to expand its addressable market. 
 U.S. Everyday Consumer Opportunity. 5.11 products address a large and broad Everyday Consumer base consisting of individuals from all walks of life. Everyday Consumers include small business owners, teachers, lawyers, farmers, homemakers and others, who enjoy wearing 5.11 during work, after work and on their weekend adventures. Management believes the Everyday Consumers are multi-generational, though skewing younger. These younger consumers are representative of an expanding, technically-focused consumer base looking for performance in every aspect of their daily lives. 5.11 caters to Everyday Consumers across all regions of the U.S., though management believes Everyday Consumers are located primarily in urban and suburban locations. 
 21 

U.S. Prosumer Opportunity. 5.11 s premium product offering addresses a large Prosumer base, including first responders, military personnel, on and off-duty public servants, non-active military and other functionally focused professionals such as contractors, utility workers, hospital professionals and others using 5.11 for professional applications. Management believes Prosumers are multi-generational, though primarily middle-aged males. Similar to its Everyday Consumers, 5.11 caters to Prosumers across all regions of the U.S. and believes Prosumers are located primarily in urban and rural locations. The Prosumer market is a stable, recurring source of demand for 5.11's products. Management believes that Prosumer demand is resilient through economic cycles as Prosumers continue to depend on 5.11 products regardless of the economic environment. 
 International Opportunity. In addition to the domestic whitespace opportunity, management believes there is opportunity to expand to a large global market, as International only represente d 21 of n et sales in 2022. 5.11 products are currently distributed in 120 countries across the globe with its market entry point being the Professional Wholesale Channel. Most countries outside the US are under-penetrated with limited distribution and select dealers only carrying a portion of available styles. As such, management believes there is significant opportunity for continued international expansion and plan to expand in EMEA, Mexico, Asia, Australia, and Canada. 5.11 s approach will be to build out each region uniquely based on the size of the opportunity and the complexity of conducting business in a particular country. This approach currently utilizes a mixture of Professional and Consumer wholesale channels, distributors, wholesale partner stores, third party e-commerce sites as well as owned e-commerce websites and retail stores. To build this business 5.11 plans to leverage its third-party logistics facilities in Europe and China as well as its owned warehouses in Australia and the US for supply chain logistics. 5.11 sees additional opportunities to further expand internationally and plan to methodically continue the expansion of its business. 
 Business Strategies 
 Increase Brand Awareness and Grow the Passionate 5.11 Community - 5.11 has proven the profitability of its core product offerings and broad geographic relevance, while demonstrating clear brand authenticity and versatility. Though 5.11 is a brand and industry leader in the tactical and functional fitness communities, management believes it still has substantial room to grow through continuing to broaden its brand awareness. 5.11 has a large, growing community of deeply loyal consumers who share an authentic connection to the brand. 5.11 brand awareness is driven largely by its authentic association with public safety and the military, who rely on 5.11 gear for performance both on-duty and off-duty. To increase brand awareness, 5.11 designs and executes a variety of dynamic, high impact marketing strategies to engage existing consumers and reach new consumers, both domestically in the U.S. and internationally. 
 5.11 s innovative brand and marketing strategy has been able to deliver significant brand awareness growth with relatively low marketing spend to date. The reason this has been so successful is due to the outsized returns from 5.11 s positive, community-driven word-of-mouth, stemming from consumers who share an emotional connection to 5.11. While 5.11 s marketing competencies extend well beyond traditional and digital media; 5.11 is a leader in content development and influencer marketing. 5.11 has built a community with major brand ambassadors and brand partners. 5.11 also partners with other leading brands across categories, such as Spartan in fitness and Ubisoft s Ghost Recon in gaming. These strategic partnerships reinforce 5.11 s authentic and premium branding while simultaneously engaging a broad and passionate customer base of potential 5.11 consumers. Through its deep relationships, history of mutually beneficial partnerships, community, and social events such as ABR Academies, as well as its recognized leadership position, management believes 5.11 has become a partner of choice for influencers worldwide, leading to a significant competitive advantage. These marketing efforts deliver authentic, aspirational experiences and exclusive content that drive loyalty and engagement. 5.11 pairs this emotional brand marketing with sophisticated, data-driven performance marketing to further drive profitable customer acquisition, retention and high lifetime value. Through investment in these marketing strategies, 5.11 intends to drive passionate 5.11 connections within its community. 
 Continued Execution of Integrated Omnichannel Platform to Drive Disciplined Growth - Management believes 5.11 has built a solid omnichannel distribution strategy, comprised of a rapidly growing DTC channel, which includes its owned retail locations, proprietary website, and third-party marketplace partners like Amazon, and a recurring Wholesale channel, which encompasses 5.11's Professional Wholesale, Consumer Wholesale, and International business. Rather than taking the traditional channel approach to the business which management believes limits 5.11's potential, 5.11 enters trade areas with a tailored DTC and wholesale strategy for that market. To best serve its consumers needs and to profitably accelerate growth, 5.11 continues to make investments in its omnichannel distribution strategy. To increase connectivity and reach a larger quantum of consumers, 5.11 is accelerating digital 
 22 

growth through the utilization of data analytics, targeted digital tactics and integrated marketing campaigns. In parallel, 5.11 continues to improve its website functionality as measured through strong site traffic, conversion and average order value. 5.11 s digital growth is complemented by the potential to expand its retail footprint. Currently, 5.11 h as 110 physical stores, which represents an increase of 106 since 2015. Ultimately, the expansion of both channels presents an accessible near-term opportunity to accelerate growth and better serve evolving consumer preferences. 
 Leverage Innovation Capabilities to Continue Developing New Products - At its core, 5.11 is an innovator that prides itself on making purpose-built technical apparel, footwear and gear for all of life s most demanding missions. Throughout its history, 5.11 developed a diverse product portfolio that has helped grow its brand to be an industry leader in both its Wholesale and DTC businesses. Through its product innovation, 5.11 developed brand affinity, built on the foundation of its strong professional business. By serving its Prosumer, 5.11 increased demand in its Everyday Consumer segment, creating a large whitespace for growth. Moving forward, 5.11 is looking to grow share of its consumers wardrobe with a continued focus on everyday and weekend wear. In order to accelerate growth and meet consumer preferences, 5.11 plans to continue its consumer product innovation and expand its lifestyle product offering and other ancillary categories. 5.11 built a foundation of infrastructure and processes that allows it to have shorter lead time on product and design. 5.11 will continue to refine this in order to accelerate growth and take market share in the consumer business through an expanded product portfolio. Management believes that continued product innovation for 5.11's Prosumers drives brand loyalty with its Everyday Consumers. 5.11 s efforts to tailor products for its Prosumers drives innovation and credibility, which in turn yields superior functionality and appeal to Everyday Consumers. As 5.11 continues to scale, its broader consumer base allows it to reinvest resources back into its technical and functional expertise, further driving continued innovation for its professional consumers. 
 Disciplined International Expansion - International re presents 21 of net sa les in 2022 and management believes 5.11 has a large opportunity to expand this business. Management believes Prosumers internationally view U.S. first responders, military and public servants as being among the best in the world, and want the same apparel, footwear and gear that they use both on and off duty. 5.11 s international strategy parallels the success it has enjoyed in the US by seeding the market through the Prosumer channels, which creates brand awareness and Everyday Consumer demand. 
 Currently 5.11 products are distributed in over 120 countries across the globe. 5.11 leverages its proven playbook to invest in the largest, most successful international regions to grow its business. This strategy starts with the Professional Wholesale channel which establishes a profitable recurring revenue stream. As that grows, 5.11 builds a Consumer Wholesale channel and finally a DTC business is established in the most mature markets. While the strategic approach is consistent, each region is uniquely built based on the size of the opportunity and the complexity of conducting business in a particular country. Management believes there is a significant opportunity to continue 5.11's international expansion with a focus on EMEA, Mexico, Asia, Australia and Canada. 5.11 s ability to supply the same superior apparel, footwear and equipment to global markets allows it to expand its already profitable international business to Everyday Consumers living by the ABR mindset around the world. 
 Competitive Strengths 
 Authentic Global Lifestyle Brand with Passionate Following - Since inception, 5.11 has been a trusted brand by military, law enforcement, public safety, first responders and frontline workers and other service professionals around the world. No matter the mission or how demanding the environment, management believes 5.11 makes the apparel, footwear and gear of choice for professionals both on and off duty. This loyalty and trust, proven over decades from when the FBI Academy first adopted 5.11 pants in 1992, is a powerful tool. This stamp of approval from the elite professional community creates a brand halo effect that propels the Everyday Consumer business, allowing 5.11 to appeal to a broad range of consumers who embrace an active lifestyle, and who also appreciate 5.11 products superior technical performance for everyday use. 
 5.11 s loyal consumers act as brand advocates, proudly wearing branded 5.11 gear and displaying 5.11 banners, decals and patches. Management believes that 5.11's brand advocacy through social media or by word-of-mouth, coupled with its varied marketing efforts, has extended its appeal to the broader community. As 5.11 has expanded its product lines, and broadened its marketing messaging, it has cultivated an increasingly diverse audience of both men and women living throughout the United States and, increasingly, in international markets. Management believes 5.11's loyal customers, alongside its heritage of authenticity and high-quality product performance create such a strong connection to the 5.11 brand. 
 23 

Deep Knowledge of Consumers Drives Product Development and Marketing - Management believe much of the 5.11 brand success is accredited to the loyalty of 5.11's consumers. 5.11 continuously strives to understand their evolving needs. Utilizing consumer insights through proprietary research, data, and analytics, 5.11 informs its product design and development teams to meet the demands and expectations of its loyal consumers. Having innovated closely with its Prosumers since 2003, 5.11 has a deep understanding and appreciation for the tactical issues they deal with daily. Seeing itself as problem-solvers first-and-foremost, 5.11 designs products that provide solutions to the obstacles they encounter while on duty, enhancing the daily regimens of its professional end-users. 5.11 consumers are passionate about their work and activities, and 5.11 matches that passion as it continuously strives to build functional, durable, and comfortable products. Not only is this insight helpful in product design and development, but also in outbound marketing efforts, both domestically and internationally. 5.11 supports and builds its brand through a fully integrated, high-impact marketing strategy which includes innovative and exclusive content, digital and social media, dedicated weekly Podcast, community-outreach, television and movie product placement and integrations, sponsorships, and local store activations and events that foster consumer engagement. 
 Purpose-Built, Innovation-Led and High-Quality Product Offering - 5.11 s DNA is readiness. 5.11 addresses the needs of elite professionals around the world, outfitting them with the top-quality gear and equipment necessary to complete their missions. From this powerful foundation, 5.11 develops products to both address the specific needs of these professionals and have broad appeal. The process for development starts with a rigorous analysis of the most important functional qualities for 5.11 Prosumers. 5.11 then engages with the broader community, along with industry and trade professionals, to help find specific voids in the market worth targeting. 5.11 uses this data and insights to develop head-to-toe assortments to serve its consumers holistically whether they are at the office, exercising, experiencing the outdoors, or simply embracing the ABR lifestyle in their daily lives. 
 5.11 delivers a comprehensive lineup that enables its customer to enjoy high-quality functionality without having to sacrifice lifestyle, comfort, or style. Management believes 5.11's ability to deliver this balance is a deep competitive advantage that is unrivaled and where most of its competitors have proven to be unsuccessful. 
 Integrated Omnichannel Distribution Strategy - The foundation of 5.11's business model is to continue to strengthen its ability to serve the Everyday Consumer and Prosumer however they prefer to engage and purchase with 5.11, while simultaneously reinforcing 5.11's brand s association and authenticity. Rather than taking the traditional channel approach to the business which management believes limits 5.11's potential, 5.11 enters trade areas with a tailored DTC and wholesale strategy for that market. With 5.11 s ability to share inventory between stores and e-commerce, we optimize speed and efficiency with logistics that truly meet 5.11's Prosumers and Everyday Consumers needs wherever they prefer to shop. We believe this principle of product accessibility and adopting to consumers shopping choices drives brand building and organic lead generation. Though each channel is able to function profitability on an individual basis, the value 5.11 derives from its channels working in concert is a competitive strength. 
 Scalable Infrastructure and High-Performance Team to Support Growth - In the past five years, 5.11 has invested heavily to not only improve operating and fulfillment performance in its current growth phase, but also as a foundation to support continued future growth. 5.11 s investment has included implementing a variety of strategic and operational improvements, including hiring experienced senior executives, expanding its company owned retail stores, executing merchandising improvements, enhancing distribution and supply chain capabilities and implementing data-driven digital marketing campaigns. 5.11 s current infrastructure allows it to fulfill orders accurately and effectively across all channels, including making certain shipments direct from the source to bypass distribution centers, while still providing buffer capacity capabilities to support future expansion. 
 Competition 
 5.11 competes in the global marketplace for purpose-built technical apparel, footwear and gear. Management believes 5.11 has competitive advantages through its global omnichannel business model, which is comprised of a rapidly growing DTC channel and recurring Wholesale channel. 5.11 competes against activewear, outdoor and specialty apparel brands such as Nike, Under Armour, The North Face, Patagonia, Lululemon, Arc teryx, Carhartt, Propper and Fecheimer Brothers. 5.11 competes with footwear brands such as Timberland, Bates and Danner, and with gear and bag brands such as Camelbak, Osprey and YETI. 5.11 also competes with specialty retailers such as REI, Dick s Sporting Goods and Galls.

 Sourcing and Manufacturing 
 5.11 does not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. Instead, it chooses to contract with third-party suppliers for materials (fabric and trims) and manufacturers for finished goods. 5.11 partners with high-quality vendors and retains complete control of all intellectual property associated with its products. 5.11 product design, technical design and development teams work directly with its vendors to incorporate innovative materials that meet the high-quality product standards demanded by its customers. 5.11 s primary product specifications include characteristics like durability, protection, functionality, and comfort. 5.11 collaborates with leading fabric suppliers to develop fabrics that it ultimately trademarks for brand recognition whenever possible. 
 The materials used in 5.11 products are developed in partnership between its material vendors and its design, product development and sourcing teams, then sourced by its manufacturers from a limited number of pre-approved suppliers. To enhance efficiency and profitability, 5.11 recently adopted 3D design capabilities for virtual prototyping allowing it to make better and quicker decisions prior to creating physical prototypes. Additionally, 5.11 recently partnered with one of its apparel manufacturers to create a development center with dedicated resources to facilitate rapid prototyping. 
 All 5.11 products are manufactured by third-parties. 5.11 works with a group of 70+ vendors, 17 of which produced approxim ately 80 of its products in fiscal year 2022 and 2021.

Additionally, in alignment with its values, 5.11 encourages its manufacturers to be certified through the Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (WRAP) program, which is an independent organization dedicated to promoting safe, lawful, humane and ethical manufacturing. Once a vendor is part of 5.11 s production network, its in-house production team work together with third-party inspectors to closely monitor each partner s compliance with applicable laws and standards on an ongoing basis. 
 5.11 regularly sources new suppliers and manufacturers to support its ongoing growth and carefully evaluates all new suppliers and manufacturers to ensure they share its standards for quality and integrity. To mitigate supplier concentration risk, 5.11 commercializes its top key items at multiple factories to ensure it can balance geographic risks as well as respond quickly to spikes in business. 5.11 also continuously seeks out additional suppliers and manufacturers to enable contingency plans that minimize disruptions, as well as support its future growth. 
 Distribution 
 5.11 leases and operates a distribution facility in Manteca, California to support its fulfillment needs across the Americas (North, Central South). Additionally, 5.11 operates a small distribution facility in New South Wales, Australia to serve the Australia and New Zealand markets. 5.11 utilizes global third-party logistics providers to fulfill customer orders in EMEA and Asia-Pacific, which are located in Sweden and China, respectively. These third-party logistics providers manage all various distribution activities in their regional markets, including product receiving, storing, limited product inspection activities, and outbound shipping.

Intellectual Property 
 To establish and protect its proprietary rights, 5.11 relies on a combination of trademark (including trade dress), patent, design, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as contractual restrictions in license agreements, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and other contracts. 5.11 s intellectual property is an important component of its business, and management believes that 5.11's know-how and continuing innovation are important to developing and maintaining its competitive position. Management also believes having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable on 5.11's products is an important factor in continuing to build its brand and distinguish its products. 5.11 considers the 5.11 name and logo trademarks, together with 70 issued and pending patents and 576 registered and pending trademarks, both in the United States and internationally, to be among its most valuable intellectual property assets. 
 Regulatory Environment 
 In the United States and the other jurisdictions in which 5.11 operates, it is subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that apply to the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of fulfillment centers and privacy, data security and data protection laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, in the United States, the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 ("GDPR") in the European Economic Area and Switzerland, the U.K. GDPR and the United Kingdom Data Protection Act 2018 in the United Kingdom, and the Brazilian General Data Protection Law in Brazil, the ePrivacy Directive and national implementing and supplementing laws in the European Economic Area. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing. 5.11 products sold outside of the United States may be subject to tariffs, treaties and various trade agreements, as well as laws affecting the importation of consumer goods. 5.11 monitors changes in these laws and management believes that 5.11 is in material compliance with applicable laws. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. A portion of sales generated by its International business is derived from sales to foreign government agencies, and management believes 5.11 is in material compliance with related applicable laws.

BOA 
 Overview 
 BOA, creator of the revolutionary, award-winning, patented BOA Fit System, partners with market-leading brands to make the best gear even better. Delivering fit solutions purpose-built for performance, the BOA Fit System is featured in footwear across snow sports, cycling, outdoor, athletic, workwear as well as performance headwear and medical bracing. The system consists of three integral parts: a micro-adjustable dial, high-tensile lightweight laces, and low friction lace guides creating a superior alternative to laces, buckles, Velcro, and other traditional closure mechanisms. Each unique BOA configuration is designed with brand partners to deliver superior fit and performance for athletes, is engineered to perform in the toughest conditions and is backed by The BOA Lifetime Guarantee. BOA is headquartered in Denver, Colorado and has offices in Austria, Greater China, South Korea, and Japan. 
 History of BOA 
 BOA was founded in 2001 by Gary Hammerslag, a snowboarder, surfer, and entrepreneur. Gary moved to Steamboat, Colorado in the mid-90 s after successfully selling his previous company, which created innovative catheter solutions that improved angioplasty procedure speed and effectiveness. After arriving in Steamboat and frequently snowboarding, Gary envisioned a possibility to dramatically improve the fit and performance of snowboard boots by applying elements of his learnings in the medical device field. Gary developed a fit system as an alternative to traditional laces for snowboard boots and partnered with K2 and Vans to launch the first BOA-equipped snowboard boots to consumers in the winter of 2001. After a successful launch, BOA became widely adopted on snowboard boots. 
 BOA s next phase of growth was largely in the outdoor sporting and recreation markets. In 2005, BOA expanded its focus to hiking and trail-related footwear, followed by cycling and golf in 2006 and hunting and fishing in 2007, at which point BOA surpassed 1 million users worldwide. From 2008 to 2011, having gained credibility in consumer markets, BOA introduced products for the workwear footwear market as well as products for the medical bracing market. In 2013, the company entered the running market, followed by court sports and training in 2019. In 2023 BOA is launching alpine downhill ski boots. 
 
 In 2019, BOA launched its state-of-the-art Performance Fit Lab ("PFL") to quantitatively measure the impact of BOA-equipped performance footwear with elite athletes. The PFL s purpose is to push the limits of athlete performance through superior fit, performance and user experience by testing, refining and improving products in collaboration with BOA s brand partners. BOA has conducted over 1,000 individual performance tests since the lab opening. The expansion into new industries and geographies coupled with the scientifically proven performance improvements has resulted in BOA surpassing 38 million users worldwide in 2022. 
 We purchased a majority interest in BOA on October 16, 2020. 
 Industry 
 BOA participates broadly in the global footwear market, representing approximately 10 billion pairs of shoes sold annually. BOA s addressable market is identified based on product type, price lane, and geography. BOA targets the premium segment, where applicable price lanes tend to be at the upper end of each industry. With respect to product type, the overall market is segmented into various subcategories, of which BOA primarily targets footwear for active performance sports, outdoor applications, and kids. Based on target footwear categories and applicable price lanes, management estimates BOA s addressable market to be approximately 800+ million pairs of shoes sold annually. Management estimates the company has approximately 4 share within its addressable market. 
 Products, Customers and Distribution Channels 
 Products 
 The BOA Fit System consists of a durable lace, which is guided by low-friction guides and attached to a dial that is typically mounted on the footwear heel, tongue or eye-stay for micro-adjustability to enhance performance fit. BOA s current product portfolio has seven platforms, H+, H, M+, M, L+, L and S-Series, which vary in cost, weight, tension, and use case. Each dial design can be customized with over 220 colors allowing the product to fit cohesively with each brand partners specific designs and colorways. 
 27 

All platforms share the distinctive characteristics that differentiate BOA from competing offerings: micro-adjustability to achieve the perfect fit, measurable performance benefits validated by the company s PFL, durability and quality proven in extensive field testing, a lifetime guarantee on the end-product s dial and laces, and the distinctive BOA sound heard when turning the dial. 
 Each platform is designed and engineered to address the specific performance fit needs of the end user by use case. Factors such as size and shape of dial, level of torque, internal mechanics, and weight vary amongst platforms, and each platform is further segmented into product collections that differ in aesthetic, optimal placement on the shoe, and cost. Within each product collection, dial designs and materials differ to accommodate preferences of the end user and retail price points of the end product. 
 Customers and Distribution Channels 
 BOA has approximately 300 global brand partners, including leading footwear companies such as Adidas, Specialized, Shimano, Fizik, ASICS, Burton, La Sportiva, K2, Vans, Saloman and FootJoy who feature BOA systems across a variety of sporting and professional industries including snow sports, cycling, outdoor, athletic, workwear and medical. BOA typically sells directly to the manufacturing partner responsible for final assembly of the brand partner s product. BOA works with 500+ brand partner factories with limited revenue concentration. Most brand partner factories are located in Asia, primarily in China and Vietnam, and are in relatively close proximity to BOA s supply chain. 
 Rather than being solely an OEM part supplier, BOA maintains highly collaborative relationships with its brand partners to actively co-develop innovative, performance-driven footwear, helmets and bracing. BOA contributes substantial design and testing resources to ensure its system is used in a way that maximizes performance based on dial placement and configuration. The BOA Fit System is not simply a lace replacement or plug and play option, but rather a solution that must be integrated into each product model through a 6-18 month development cycle to create an application that works specifically with a product s unique structural design. This process allows BOA to ensure brand image consistency, end product quality and the best performance fit. 
 Footwear and headwear products featuring BOA systems are primarily sold through brick-and-mortar sporting goods retailers, specialty sport retailers, online retailers, or brand partners owned retail and online channels. According to management s estimates, end consumption is geographically diverse, with approximately 20 of products consumed in North America, 35 in Europe, and 45 in Asia. 
 One individual customer represented approximately 13 of BOA's net revenues in 2022. No other individual customer or brand partner factory represented greater than 10 of BOA s net revenues in 2022 or 2021. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, BOA had approximately 18.8 million and 31.7 million in order backlog, respectively. 
 Business Strategies and Competitive Strengths 
 Business Strategies 
 Continued Share Growth in Established Categories - BOA has established a strong presence in certain core industries globally including cycling and snowboarding. BOA has established strong positions in the workwear industry in Europe, outdoor industry in Korea, and the athletic industry in Japan and China. The company is on pace to achieve approximately 10 model count growth consistent with BOA's long-term expectations. 
 Going forward, BOA intends to continue to build its brand partner relationships to expand penetration and capture additional share in growing markets such as workwear in North America and Asia and outdoor/athletic in Europe and North America. BOA has developed region and industry specific products to better cater to the individual dynamics of each market including products that deliver a better price/value proposition, new product configurations for region specific trends and performance fit messaging to increase consumer awareness and adoption. Through its reputation in the marketplace, athlete endorsements and deep relationships with leading brand partners, the company is focused on delivering the performance benefits of the BOA system across an expanding set of sporting categories and geographies. 
 Expand into Pioneering Categories - BOA has identified several adjacent segments including alpine skiing, trail running, and court sports such as tennis, badminton and basketball which management believes are well suited to benefit from the performance fit that BOA provides. BOA is actively working with leading brand partners to develop 
 28 

sport-specific footwear configurations that can benefit from the advantages of the BOA Fit System. By leveraging BOA s brand equity and proven solutions, the company believes there is significant whitespace to increase penetration in these early adoption segments. 
 Competitive Strengths 
 Culture of Innovation and New Product Development - Management believes that there is significant opportunity to continue advancing product offerings through its commitment to innovation. Product development and innovation are divided amongst (i) BOA s internal innovation and evolution of its fit systems and platforms, refining and improving on the aesthetics, durability, user experience, and price/value, (ii) the design and engineering collaboration that BOA engages in with its brand partners for project and application-specific needs, and (iii) BOA s advanced research through its PFL, which is transforming markets through innovative performance fit solutions that are scientifically tested and validated. 
 Deep Collaborative Partnerships BOA has deep partnerships with the premier brands in every segment they compete within. They collaborate throughout the entire product lifecycle process, including product strategy, design and development, factory operational/service support, retail education, consumer warranty support, and marketing/demand creation. BOA has a high partner retention rate due to the depth and value of the relationships. 
 Premium Brand Position - BOA is focused on continuing to build awareness around its aspirational, global brand through content leadership, athlete endorsements, paid media, brand partner affiliations, retail engagement/ education and other business. BOA primarily increases awareness through direct-to-consumer marketing and co-marketing with its established brand partner relationships. In 2019, BOA launched its Pioneer Program, an athletic sponsorship platform. BOA leverages athlete endorsements to further establish its positioning as a performance fit leader as well as drive cross-segment brand awareness. The company recently launched its Dialed in Campaign, which showcases pioneers performing at their peak both physically and mentally. BOA also relies on its trusted brand partners to increase BOA brand awareness. The company focuses its efforts on collaborating with brand partners who are innovative market leaders that meet BOA s brand standards and align with BOA s positioning as a high-performance, premium brand. 
 Technology Leader with Robust Patent Portfolio BOA is a leader in performance fit innovation and has built a diverse global portfolio of issued and pending utility and design patents, creating barriers to entry. Throughout BOA s history, the company has continually innovated on dial attributes including quick release, durability, manufacturing ease, and micro adjustability, in addition to integrated lace and lace guide designs and configurations critical to imparting precision fit and reduced friction. BOA s engineering and technical expertise enables the development and production of performance fit solutions, allowing their brand partners to offer performance enhancing technology and product differentiation. 
 Competition 
 BOA s competition can be segmented into three categories: established footwear brands that maintain their own proprietary technology for particular market segments, lower-quality subscale BOA imitators, and non-mechanical lace alternatives (bungies, buckles, plastic lace locks, Velcro, and webbing). Management estimates that BOA is 25+ times the size of its next closest direct competitor. 
 Research and Development 
 BOA s approach to new product development is a multi-stage, cross-functional process. For each new product introduction, BOA works closely with brand partners to identify or develop the best suited BOA solution, its optimal placement on the shoe (or other application), color and design specifications, and cost targets. On existing products, BOA is committed to continuous innovation, including key improvements such as lower installation costs for brand partner factories, thinner and sleeker product profiles for improved aesthetics, in field warranty rate reduction to approximately 0.5 , improved user experience, and the broadening of the platform suite to address key opportunities in alpine skiing, basketball, and outdoor. 
 As part of BOA s innovation strategy around improving fit, the company has invested in a state-of-the-art PFL to quantitatively measure the impact of the BOA system on end products. The PFL is testing a significant number of products to evaluate a) Agility Speed, b) Power Precision, and c) Endurance Health. By addressing these global performance attributes rather than segment-by-segment specific needs, PFL findings will be relevant and applicable across BOA s product lines. The results of these studies help further validate BOA s value proposition, 
 29 

strengthening the company s position as a fit and performance leader. Moreover, the PFL serves as a platform to test and refine new product offerings ahead of launch. 
 Suppliers 
 BOA maintains a longstanding deep relationship with a sole supplier for plastic injected parts (dial units and lace guides), representing approximately 70 of total purchases. The vendor is based in China with multiple facilities and is currently working with BOA to diversify its geographical footprint. Furthermore, the vendor has supplied the company since 2001 and has continuously invested in its tools and infrastructure to maintain quality standards and keep up with demand. BOA owns all its injection molds. Lastly, the vendor is also a minority shareholder in BOA and is committed to supporting its growth. The remainder of BOA s purchases are for steel and steel coated lace, textile laces and guides, monofilament lace and webbing, which are sourced from China, Korea, Europe, and the U.S. Management believes its manufacturing partners have sufficient capacity to accommodate future growth. 
 Intellectual Property 
 BOA has built a diverse global patent portfolio of 235 issued and pending utility patents and 85 issued and pending designs. The company currently has 38 active patent families as well as 24 active design families with intellectual property covering its core technology (dials, guides, laces), as well as strategic configurations and component installation methods. BOA maintains 165 registered and pending trademarks protecting 13 unique marks, with core marks filed in 40+ countries. 
 Seasonality 
 Due to the diversity of sporting segments BOA participates in, there is no significant seasonality to the business. 
 Environmental, Social and Governance 
 As a forward-looking company, BOA is working towards making a sustainable impact throughout the world, minimizing their imprint on the environment, and diversifying the Outdoor and STEM industries. BOA is working to reduce the use of virgin fossil fuel-based plastics, reduce overall manufacturing waste, and materially increase use of sustainable energy. The company has already made progress in all three areas. In the last two years, BOA has increased their budget and invested in three new roles to focus on these efforts. The company has formed partnerships with organizations in every region in which it operates that are focused on providing more access and opportunities to under-represented populations and protecting the environment. Through these programs, BOA is working to create purposeful connections to their employees, partners, and consumers bringing their mission, values, and products to the hearts and minds of their audience. 
 Human Capital 
 BOA strives to be an inclusive global team that trusts and cares for each other, their partners, the community, and the environment. Since their launch in Steamboat, CO in 2001, BOA has maintained a strong and healthy company culture that is rooted in a passion for the outdoors and the various industries that encompass their product offering. As the team has expanded over the last 21 years, BOA has placed an emphasis on creating a diverse and inclusive workplace with the goal of representing their global communities. BOA employees are located in four countries and the United States. As of December 31, 2022, BOA ha d 268 full-time employees and 4 part-time employees. 140 employees are located in the United States and 132 work outside of the United State s in Austria, Greater China, Japan, and South Korea. 
 BOA is focused on both attracting new talent and growing talent from within the organization - providing learning and development opportunities, placing an emphasis on independent career plans, and building a team of leaders, managers, and staff that represents their mission, vision, and values. BOA maintains a high retention rate of their employees and believes the company's relationship with its employees is connected and transparent. 
 
 Ergobaby 
 Overview 
 Ergobaby is dedicated to building a global community of confident parents with smart, ergonomic solutions that enable and encourage bonding between parents and babies. Ergobaby offers a broad range of award-winning baby 
 30 

carriers, blankets and swaddlers, nursing pillows, strollers, bouncers and related products that fit into families daily lives seamlessly, comfortably and safely. Ergobaby is headquartered in Torrance, California. 
 History of Ergobaby 
 Ergobaby was founded in 2003 by Karin Frost, who designed her first baby carrier following the birth of her son. The baby carrier product line has since expanded into 3-position and 4-position carriers, with multiple style variations. In its second year of operations, Ergobaby sold 10,500 baby carriers and today sells over 1 million a year. In order to support the rapid growth, in 2007, Ergobaby made a strategic decision to establish an operating subsidiary EBEU in Hamburg, Germany. 
 In 2014, Ergobaby launched the Ergobaby Four-Position 360 Baby Carrier which expanded on Ergobaby s leadership in the baby carrier category by offering an ergonomic, outward forward facing position for the baby and comfort for the parent. The Ergobaby 360 Carrier won the 2014 JPMA Innovation award in the baby carrier category. In 2016, Ergobaby launched the 3-Position Adapt Baby Carrier that is geared for newborns to toddlers (7lbs-45lbs) and offers some unique parent comfort features including lumbar support and crossable shoulder straps, as well as the benefit of being an all-in-one carrier with no need for an infant insert accessory (for babies 7-12lbs.). Also in 2016, Ergobaby acquired membership interests of New Baby Tula LLC Baby Tula ). Baby Tula designs, markets and distributes premium baby carriers and accessories and focuses its efforts on both the ergonomics and fashion of its products. In 2017, Ergobaby launched the All Position, All-in-One Omni 360 Baby Carrier that is geared for newborns to toddlers (7lbs-45lbs) and includes all of Ergobaby s parent baby comfort features from the 360 and Adapt Baby Carriers, as well as the same consumer benefit of no infant insert accessory needed. 
 In 2018, Ergobaby entered into the stroller category with 2 new models. The first product launched was a full-size option called the 180 Reversible Stroller. This was followed later in the year by a premium compact option, the Metro Compact City Stroller . In 2019, Ergobaby launched the Embrace Baby Carrier which is geared for newborns (7lbs-25lbs) and merges the coziness of a soft wrap carrier with the simplicity and comfort of a structured carrier. In 2020, Ergobaby launched Everlove, a first of its kind carrier buyback, restoration, and resell program to extend the lifecycle of its carriers for a more sustainable future. In 2021, Ergobaby launched the multiple award winning Aerloom, the first-of-its-kind, FORMAKNIT baby carrier made to move, stretch and fit parents' daily life. This carrier has a seamless knit design and 87 of the knit is made with recycled plastic bottles. Most recently, in 2022, Ergobaby launched the Evolve Home Collection featuring the 3-in-1 Bouncer. The Evolve Bouncer was designed and developed with guidance from a pediatric orthopedist and transforms from cozy newborn lounger to a calming baby bouncer to a fun and functional toddler seat. 
 We purchased a majority interest in Ergobaby on September 16, 2010. 
 Industry 
 Ergobaby competes in the large and expanding infant and juvenile products industry. The industry exhibits little seasonality and is somewhat insulated from overall economic trends, as parents view spending on children as largely non-discretionary in nature. Consequently, parents spend consistently on their children, particularly on durable items, such as car seats, strollers, baby carriers, and related items that are viewed as necessities. Further, an emotional component is often a factor in parents purchasing decisions, as parents desire to purchase the best and safest products for their children. On average, households spent between 11 - 27 of their before-tax income on a child. Similar patterns are seen in other countries around the world. 
 Demand drivers fueling the growing spending on infant and juvenile products include favorable demographic trends, such as (i) a high percentage of first time births; (ii) an increasing age of first time mothers and a large percentage of working mothers with increased disposable income; and (iii) an increasing percentage of single child households and two-family households. 
 In purchases of baby durables, parents often seek well-known and trusted brands that offer a sense of comfort regarding a product s reliability and safety. As a result, brand name, comfort and safety certifications can serve as a barrier to entry for competition in the market, as well as allow well-known brands such as Ergobaby and Baby Tula to compete in a growing premium segment. 
 31 

Products, Customers and Distribution Channels 
 Products 
 Baby Carriers - Ergobaby has two main baby carrier product lines: baby carriers and related carrier accessories, sold under both the Ergobaby and Tula brands. Ergobaby s baby carrier designs support a natural, ergonomic ("M" shaped) sitting position for babies, eliminating compression of the spine and hips that can be caused by unsupported suspension. The baby carrier also distributes the baby s weight evenly between parents hips and shoulders and alleviates physical stress for the parent. Both Ergobaby s 3-Position and 4-Position baby carriers have been recognized by the International Hip Dysplasia Institute as being hip healthy . Additional accessories are provided to complement the baby carriers including the popular Infant Insert. 
 Within the Ergobaby Baby Carrier product line, Ergo sells 3-Position and 4-Position baby carriers in a variety of style and color variations and Baby Tula sells 3-Position and 4-Position fashion-oriented baby carriers. Baby Carrier sales represented approxim ately 87 , 90 and 89 , of net sales in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. 
 Ergobaby s core Baby Carrier product offering s with average retail prices are summarized below: 
 Ergo 
 9 styles of baby carriers - 49 - 249 
 1 styles of Infant Inserts - 35 
 Tula 
 8 styles of baby carriers - 79 - 800 
 1 style of Infant Inserts - 20 
 Customers and Distribution Channels 
 Ergobaby primarily sells its products through brick-and-mortar retailers, national chain stores, online retailers and distributors. In Europe, Ergobaby products are sold through its German based subsidiary, which services brick-and-mortar retailers and online retailers in Germany and France; it s United Kingdom based subsidiary; and its Tula subsidiary in Poland; as well as a network of distributors located in Sweden, Norway, Spain, Denmark, Italy, Turkey, and the Ukraine. Customers in Canada are predominately serviced by Ergobaby s Canadian subsidiary. Sales to customers outside of the U.S., Canadian and European markets are predominantly serviced through distributors granted rights, though not necessarily exclusive, to sell within a specific geographic region. 
 Ergobaby had approximatel y 9.9 million and 14.3 million in firm backlog orders at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Two individual customers accounted for approxim ately 27 , 25 and 25 of Ergob aby's gross sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020. No other single customer represented more than 10 of E rgobaby s gross sales in 2022, 2021 or 2020. 
 Business Strategies and Competitive Strengths 
 Business Strategies 
 Increase Penetration of Current U.S. Distribution Channels - Ergobaby continues to benefit from steady expansion of the market for wearable baby carriers and related accessories in the U.S. and internationally. Going forward, Ergobaby will continue to leverage and expand the awareness of its outstanding brands (both Ergobaby and Baby Tula) in order to capture additional market share in the U.S., as parents increasingly recognize the enhanced mobility, convenience, and the ability to remain close to the child that all Ergobaby carriers enable. Ergobaby currently markets its products to consumers in the U.S. through brick-and-mortar retailers, national chain stores, online retailers, and directly through Ergobaby.com and Babytula.com websites. 
 International Market Expansion - Testimony to the global strength of its lifestyle brand, Ergobaby has historically derived approximately 60 of its sales from international markets. Like it has in the U.S., Ergobaby can continue to leverage the Ergo and Tula brand equity in the international markets it currently serves to aggressively drive future growth, as well as expand its international presence into new regions. The market for Ergobaby s products abroad continues to grow rapidly, in part due to the fact that in many parts of Europe and Asia, the concept of baby wearing is a culturally entrenched form of infant and child transport. 
 New Product Development - Management believes Ergobaby has an opportunity to leverage its unique, authentic lifestyle brands and expand its product line. Since its founding in 2003, Ergobaby has successfully introduced new carrier products to maintain innovation, uniqueness, and freshness within its baby carrier and travel system product 
 32 

lines and has become the baby carrier industry leader with the Omni 360 baby carrier. In addition to expanding into new product carriers like swaddling and nursing pillows, in 2018, Ergobaby entered the stroller category by introducing a new premium compact stroller (Metro Compact City Stroller) and a full-size stroller (180 Reversible Stroller) and in 2022, Ergobaby entered the bouncer category with the Evolve 3-in-1 Bouncer and Evolve 3-in-1 High Chair. 
 Competitive Strengths 
 Ergobaby innovation - Ergobaby Carriers are known for their unsurpassed comfort. Ergobaby s superior design results in improved comfort for both parent and baby. Parents are comfortable because baby s weight is evenly distributed between the hips and shoulders while baby sits ergonomically in a natural ("M" shaped) sitting position. The concept of baby carrying has increased in popularity in the U.S. as parents recognize the emotional and functional benefits of carrying their baby. Consumers continually cite the comfort, design, and convenient hands free mobility the Ergobaby carrier offers as key purchasing criteria. Ergobaby is also recognized as an industry leader in innovation. With launches of new products happening regularly, (the The Ergo 4 Position 360 in 2014, Adapt in 2016, Omni 360 in 2017, Embrace Newborn Carrier in 2019, Aerloom in 2020, Omni Breeze and Omni Dream in 2021) Ergobaby continues to innovate in the baby carrier segment on a regular basis. 
 Ergobaby's commitment to supporting families led to designing the most comfortable compact stroller on the market, Metro+ and most recently, the Evolve Home Collection featuring the 3-in-1 Bouncer that is thoughtfully designed to grow with families. 
 Baby Tula Community - Tula enjoys an active and enthusiastic community who are vocal advocates for the brand. The Tula community acts as both an avid source of feedback on new product launches, which influence future product and patterns, as well as brand influencers to the broader new parenting community. 
 Competition 
 The infant and juvenile products market is fragmented, with a few larger manufacturers and marketers with portfolios of brands and a multitude of smaller, private companies with relatively targeted product offerings. 
 Within the infant and juvenile products market, Ergobaby s baby carriers primarily compete with companies that market wearable baby carriers. Within the wearable baby carrier market, several distinct segments exist, including (i) slings and wraps; (ii) soft-structured baby carriers; and (iii) hard frame baby carriers. 
 The primary global competitors in this segment are BabyBjorn, Infantino, and Chicco. In geographies globally, Ergobaby also competes with companies that have developed wearable carriers, such as Infantino, Manduca, Cybex, Nuna, Stokke, Boppy, and Pognae. Within the soft-structured baby carrier segment, Ergobaby benefits from strong distribution, good word of mouth, and the functionality of the design. 
 Suppliers 
 During 2022, Ergobaby sourced its Ergo carrier and carrier accessory products from Vietnam and India, and manufactured its stroller systems, bouncer and accessory products in China.

 Lugano 
 Overview 
 Lugano is a leading designer, manufacturer, and retailer of high-end jewelry. Lugano utilizes an extensive network of suppliers to procure high-quality diamonds and rare gemstones. Often taking inspiration directly from the stone, Lugano designs and creates one-of-a-kind jewelry that it sells to a broad base of clients. Lugano conducts sales via its own retail salons as well as pop-up showrooms at Lugano-hosted or sponsored events in partnership with influential organizations in the equestrian, art, and philanthropic communities. Lugano is headquartered in Newport Beach, California. 
 History of Lugano 
 Lugano was founded in 2004 by husband-and-wife team Moti and Idit Ferder. The company s chosen name, Lugano was inspired by the picturesque Lake Lugano of southern Switzerland, a one-of-a-kind gemstone of nature surrounded by the Lugano Prealps mountains. 
 Lugano opened its first retail salon in 2005 in Newport Beach, California as an appointment only showroom. This salon, located in Orange County s high-end Fashion Island shopping district, grew rapidly, and served as a critical proof of concept for the Lugano s bespoke retail strategy. In the subsequent years, Lugano opened three more retail salons with its trademark high-touch sales approach to expand the Lugano s geographic footprint in key destinations frequented by its target clientele. 
 In 2008, Lugano started an equestrian division focused on the Southeastern United States to complement its retail sales strategy. Today, Lugano sponsors many key equestrian events and is a long-standing supporter of equestrian-related causes. 
 Throughout its history, Lugano has also focused on building strong relationships with influential social and philanthropic organizations in the local communities surrounding its retail salons. In Aspen, Colorado Lugano frequently hosts private dinners and events in collaboration with organizations like the Aspen Institute or the Aspen Museum of Art. Lugano s event-based marketing strategy enables Lugano to regularly meet prospective clients and reconnect with repeat clients. 
 In 2020, Lugano expanded its production capabilities by building an in-house workshop to provide increased production efficiencies and improve control over its high-end gemstone inventory. In 2022, Lugano opened a new retail salon in Houston, Texas, and expanded its original retail salon in Newport Beach, CA into its first flagship location in the prestigious Fashion Island shopping center. 
 Today, Lugano s unique go-to-market strategy, one-of-a-kind designs, vertical integration and carefully cultivated network of clientele serve as critical differentiators among the retailer s competitors in the high-end jewelry market. 
 We purchased a majority interest in Lugano on September 3, 2021. 
 Sales and Distribution 
 Products 
 Lugano designs, manufactures, and retails high-end jewelry including unique rings, necklaces, earrings, bracelets and brooches that range in price from under 1,000 to well over seven figures, with an average price of 
 34 

approximately 238,000 per piece. Lugano s designers start with a rare stone as inspiration and craft jewelry that highlights the beauty and perceived value of the stone. As a result, Lugano s pieces are often seen as one-of-a-kind works of art, creating a highly desirable niche in the broader jewelry marketplace. Competitors products are typically high volume or collection-based jewelry lines that are inherently less unique or exclusive traits highly valued by Lugano s clientele. 
 Customers 
 Lugano s client base generally consists of sophisticated, high-net-worth individuals who value long-standing relationships and a personalized sales approach over one-time purchases and the high-pressure sales tactics used by other jewelry competitors. A typical Lugano client is community and relationship-driven and seeks unique products with emotional significance. The purchasers or recipients of Lugano pieces are predominantly women and often leaders in their respective communities. Lugano s clients can range in age from 25 to over 80 and come from all over the nation, with most based in California, followed by Florida, New York, Texas, and Colorado, reflecting the company s current retail salon footprint, along with limited international clientele. 
 Lugano s retail revenue is diversified with no customer representing greater than 10 of total revenue in 2022. Management also believes its client relationships are significantly stickier than those of other jewelry retailers. Lugano enjoys a growing percentage of repeat business year-over-year, with repeat customers contributing an increasing percentage of revenue. Beyond its retail business, Lugano also sells loose diamonds via its wholesale division representing approximatel y 9 o f Lugano s revenue in 2022. 
 Distribution 
 Lugano goes to marke t via five retail salons in Newport Beach, California, Palm Beach, Florida, Aspen, Colorado, Houston, Texas and Ocala, Florida, all strategically located in wealthy regions near popular vacation and up-scale shopping destinations frequented by Lugano s target clientele. In a salon, Lugano aims for an elegant and private ambience to facilitate its high-touch sales approach. Salons are carefully laid out, enabling Lugano to host private dinners, parties, or other social events. Unlike other jewelers that highlight their jewelry with long, rectangular counters that separate the customer from the salesperson, Lugano decorates its salons with curved tables and couches designed to facilitate comfort, relationship-building, and ease of conversation. Lugano also markets and sells jewelry via pop-up showrooms at Lugano-hosted or sponsored events or in the homes of its clients. 
 Market Trends, Business Strategies and Competition 
 Market Trends 
 Lugano competes broadly in the personal luxury goods market, a portion of the overall global luxury market. According to Bain Company, after years of consistent growth, the personal luxury goods market experienced a brief contraction in 2020. However, since then, the personal luxury goods market has grown to hit 320 billion, increasing the size of the market by 1 versus 2019 levels. Bain Company estimates that the personal luxury goods market could reach 408- 430 billion by 2025 with a sustained growth of 6-8 annually. 
 Lugano currently has very low penetration 
 Competition 
 The luxury jewelry market is highly fragmented with the leading six to seven companies accounting for approximately 20 of the market. LVMH, with brands like Tiffany, Bvlgari and Chaumet; Richemont with brands like Cartier and Van Cleef Arpels; Graff Diamonds; and Harry Winston lead the market. These competitors often utilize a traditional retail model focused on foot traffic and tourism, are typically collection-based, and do not exclusively 
 35 

focus on the high-end segment of the jewelry market. The remaining portion of the market consists of national retail brands and small or midsize players that operate regionally or in an online-only format. 
 Competitive Strengths 
 Sourcing, Design and Production Capabilities 
 A deep network of international vendors enables the company to source rare and difficult-to-find stones. These stones are then combined with the world-class capabilities of Lugano designers who create sought-after masterpieces that cater to the company s target clientele. Lugano s in-house production workshop or close network of captive workshops provide increased production efficiencies, improved control over its inventory and better speed to market. 
 High-touch Retail Model 
 Lugano s one-of-a-kind inventory requires a unique and high-touch sales strategy which the company has cultivated over its nearly 20-year history. The company s retail experience is carefully curated, emphasizing both exclusivity and elegance, both critical to the sale of Lugano jewelry. 
 Event-based Marketing Strategy 
 Lugano sponsors over one hundred events each year, enabling the company to meet prospective clients and reconnect with existing clients that have become loyal and repeat purchasers. In each market that Lugano enters, management takes great care to establish itself as part of the local community and become a focal point for its clients lifestyles and activities. Through its efforts, Lugano invests in relationships which build brand value and customer loyalty. Lugano-sponsored events are often a client s gateway into the Lugano community (management estimates over 60 of clients are initially contacted at Lugano-sponsored events). Once a part of the Lugano community, customers tend to view jewelry purchases from Lugano as recurring events and often increase the size of their purchase from their previous transaction. 
 Sourcing and Availability of Materials 
 Lugano sources diamonds and precious gemstones from a variety of vendors and wholesalers. Generally, Lugano sources polished diamonds and gemstones that are crafted into a Lugano-designed piece. From time to time, Lugano also opportunistically acquires finished jewelry with a high resale value from its global network of vendors. Most of Lugano s diamonds are sourced from domestic wholesalers. By not purchasing raw stones directly from mines, Lugano limits conflict diamond exposure. Lugano ensures all its diamond vendors adhere to the Kimberly Process Certification Scheme to prevent conflict diamonds from entering its supply chain. 
 Lugano s vendor base is diversified with no vendor making up more than 10 of total purchases and the top 10 vendors making up less than 50 of all purchases. Lugano maintains decade-long and trusted relationships with its top vendors. 
 Seasonality 
 While individual retail salons experience some seasonality (e.g., winter in Aspen, summer in Newport Beach), these patterns offset one another at the company-level. Additionally, due to the variety of events Lugano hosts all-year-round, there is no significant seasonality in the business. 
 Human Capital 
 As of December 31, 2022, Lugano employed a non-union labor force of 88 full-time e mployees. 41 employees work in sales and marketing, 12 work in design production, 21 work in operations, with the remainder in corporate and administration. Lugano intends to continue to grow its headcount and build out its middle management as it executes on its growth strategy of new salon openings, increased event-based marketing, and international expansion. Management believes Lugano's relationship with its employees is good. 
 
 Marucci Sports 
 Overview 
 Founded in 2009 and headquartered in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Marucci is a leading designer, manufacturer, and marketer of premium wood and metal baseball bats, metal softball bats, fielding gloves, batting gloves, bags, 
 36 

protective gear, sunglasses, on and off-field apparel, and other baseball and softball equipment used by professional and amateur athletes. Marucci also develops both corporate-owned and franchised sports training facilities. Marucci products are available through owned websites, their team sales organization, Big Box Retailers, and third-party e-commerce and resellers. In 2017, Marucci acquired Victus Sports, a King of Prussia, Pennsylvania based complementary baseball equipment manufacturer and distributor. Marucci has vertically integrated wood bat manufacturing and has built long-standing relationships with international suppliers who manufacture the remainder of their product lines. In 2020, Marucci acquired Lizard Skins, headquartered in American Fork, Utah, to expand its product offering to include grips used in baseball and softball, but also in other sports including cycling, hockey, lacrosse, pickleball and gaming. 
 Marucci is an established brand commanding strong market share across product categories. Marucci s mission is to honor the game and brands itself as such with simplistic imagery and to-the-point marketing campaigns. 
 Victus is a more recent entrant to the baseball equipment market but garners similar wood bat usage as Marucci. The brand is widely recognized for its edgy designs and big attitude. Victus mission, in contrast to Marucci s, is to embrace the evolution of the game and to salute the next generation of players who set out to change it. 
 Lizard Skins, with its industry leading technology, is positioned to be the best grip solution across multiple sports, as well as other market opportunities. 
 History of Marucci Sports 
 Marucci Sports was founded in 2009 by a team including two former professional baseball players. Marucci released its first metal bat, the Marucci CAT5, in 2009. In 2013, Marucci released batting gloves and launched its first series of fielding gloves, the Founders Series. Marucci was able to leverage its brand power to expand into the baseball apparel and accessories market as well. In 2018, Marucci acquired Carpenter Trade to expand the quality and technology of its fielding glove offering and change the current consumer expectations for a truly customized fielding glove. Victus product offering expanded into metal bats in 2019 with the launch of its Vandal line and recently expanded with the launch of the NOX. In 2019 Marucci also acquired two timber mills and a wood drying facility, securing vertical manufacturing capabilities within its wood bat product category and ensuring access to the best wood in the game. In 2021, Marucci acquired Lizard Skins, a designer and seller of branded grip products, protective equipment, bags and apparel for use in baseball, cycling, hockey, Esports and lacrosse. Marucci believes that the acquisition of Lizard Skins will allow it to build on its leading position in diamond sports while simultaneously developing the company s presence in new sports markets such as hockey and cycling. 
 Today, Marucci is a designer, manufacturer, and marketer of premium Marucci, Victus and Lizard Skins branded baseball and softball equipment including wood and metal baseball bats, fielding gloves, batting gloves, bags, protective gear, sunglasses, on and off-field apparel, grips and other baseball and softball equipment. All of these products are sold around the world in retail stores, online direct to partner organizations and through its corporate owned and franchised training facilities. 
 We acquired a majority interest in Marucci on April 20, 2020. 
 Industry 
 Marucci Sports primarily competes primarily in the domestic baseball equipment market which includes wood bats, metal bats, fielding gloves, cleats, protective and other gear, and uniforms/ team apparel of which management estimates constitutes approximately 1.3 billion of annual retail revenue. Marucci Sports also competes within the greater global baseball equipment market which management estimates constitutes approximately 2.2 billion of annual retail revenue. Marucci s product offering targets primarily the premium equipment price point more often used in competitive club and travel leagues, for which participation rates are generally more stable. 
 The industry is generally considered to be a stable sector with growth rates in the low single digits. Baseball equipment is largely sold through national retailers. Independent resellers and online platforms also sell baseball equipment while the balance is purchased directly from the manufacturer. 
 Products, Customers and Distribution Channels 
 Products 
 Marucci designs, manufactures, and markets six categories of products: (i) metal bats, (ii) wood bats, (iii) apparel accessories, (iv) batting gloves, (v) fielding gloves, and (vi) bags protective equipment. Marucci s product strategy 
 37 

encompasses producing high quality products recognized by consumers for their performance, craftsmanship, and value, and building on a rich history to introduce innovative new products . 
 Metal Bats - Metal bats have historically represented Marucci s largest product category by revenue. The metal bats are priced at the premium end of the market, with average retail prices ran ging from 219.99 to 549.99. Ma rucci produces metal bats for all ages, from college to tee ball, with a focus on elite high school baseball and softball players. The CAT series is the flagship metal bat product from Marucci. Marucci also offers a lower price point model, the F5. Victus first metal offering, the Vandal, was first launched in 2019, and is priced similarly to the CAT series. Victus later introduced its first two-piece bat in the NOX. Metal bats used in youth and elite travel leagues are subject to strict regulations limiting spring and exit velocity. The company has historically followed a two-year product release cycle, and Marucci metal bats have notable staying power with their customer base as prior year models remain in production. 
 Wood Bats - Marucci and Victus wood bats are built with quality, precision, and customization. Both companies pride themselves in making every pro-bound bat a game bat . Marucci offers two types of wood bats: ash and maple. In addition to ash and maple, Victus offers a wood bat made of birch. Ash is a soft, open grain wood. Maple bats are a much harder, closed grain wood and constitute a large majority of the company s wood bat sales. Birch is a softer wood, offering a more flexible bat. The wide variety of selection and price points offer professional-level quality and cuts to amateur players as well. Innovative customization options further drive engagement. 
 Fielding Gloves - Marucci offers a growing set of fielding gloves across eight product series: Capitol, Cypress, Ascension, Oxbow, Acadia, Caddo, Krewe,Magnolia (softball), and Palmetto (softball). Marucci has a complete line of gloves to meet the needs of every position player at every age and skill level. Marucci offers gloves across the pricing spectrum. Marucci acquired Carpenter Trade in 2018, along with their C-Mod technology which provides a unique fit. The C-Mod technology uses a size-specific, ergonomically shaped fit system that creates a more form fitting hand stall for greater control, leverage and responsiveness when fielding. The tailored-fit technology is available in straight or shift. 
 Apparel Accessories - Marucci offers a full suite of apparel and accessory offerings that is rapidly expanding. The current product portfolio includes on-field and off-field apparel, sunglasses, hats, grips, and more. Most sales of these products are sold direct-to-team in custom apparel packages including baseball pants, jerseys, practice shirts, and more. Marucci has in-house screen-printing operations allowing for customization of various pieces of a pparel. The acquisition of Lizard Skins in October 2021 further enhanced the company s accessory offering. Lizard Skins is the top manufacturer and marketer of grips used in baseball, cycling, hockey, lacrosse, gaming, and various other sports. 
 Batting Gloves - All Marucci batting gloves are designed to meet professional standards of comfort, durability and performance while also appealing to users of all levels. Marucci has four lines of batting gloves: Pittards Reserve, Signature, Quest, and Code while Victus has one, the Debut. Marucci also offers limited production customized batting gloves. Marucci s batting gloves span the pricing spectrum. 
 Bags Protective Gear - Marucci offers an extensive line of bags and protective gear including bat packs, bat quivers, helmets, shin and elbow guards, catchers gear, and more allowing Marucci to cater to nearly all its customers playing needs. 
 Customers and Distribution Channels 
 Marucci sells its products through several channels including Big Box Retailers; Direct-to-Consumer ("DTC"), Direct-to-Team ("DTT"), the company's experiential Clubhouse retail stores and other Owned Channels; and third-party e-commerce and resellers. Marucci s top 5 customers accounted for 50 of 2022 gross sales and 58 of 2021 gross sales. 
 Marucci had approximately 41.6 million and 44.6 million in firm backlog orders at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Business Strategies and Competitive Strengths 
 Business Strategies 
 Continued Innovation in Existing Product Categories - Marucci plans to continue to build on its successful history of bringing new, innovative, highly anticipated products to market through leveraging its stringent new 
 38 

product development process, and external and internal manufacturing capabilities. The company has near-term new product launches and existing product updates planned across all categories that will further drive innovation, strengthening its competitive positioning. 
 Further Penetration of Existing Customer Accounts - Marucci has identified opportunities to leverage its existing relationships with retailers to drive expanded SKU offerings across categories, especially in apparel. Additionally, management believes the company can continue to improve Victus product adoption with existing channel partners. 
 An approximately 175 million fielding glove market represents a significant growth opportunity for Marucci. Fielding gloves are the second largest hard goods market in baseball / softball. Marucci plans to leverage its brand strength and innovation to capture share in this high margin category. The acquisition of Carpenter Trade in 2018 has allowed Marucci to offer a highly customized glove that serves as a key differentiator in fielding gloves. 
 Utilization of Game Changing Product Lab With the Company s partnership with Baseball Performance Lab BPL ), all brands underneath the Marucci umbrella are able to design the best, most customized products specific to the individual athlete. This product innovation was evidenced in the successful launch of the CatX line, but has also helped Victus and Marucci continue to gain market share with the top players in the world playing professionally. The Company plans to continue to work with the lab to design and test products in all categories to ensure all products remain at the highest level of performance. 
 Victus Category and Product Expansion - Victus has strong penetration in the majors and key affiliations with top players. The brand released its first metal bat in 2019, the one-piece Victus Vandal BBCOR bat and later launched its first two-piece bat, the NOX. Metal bats sales are expected to meaningfully contribute to Victus overall sales in the future. Victus key affiliates and player advocacy has driven a halo effect across other categories. Growth in lifestyle and fan apparel represents a significant opportunity for Victus to leverage its brand. 
 Lizard Skin Expansion With the acquisition of Lizard Skins in October 2021, Marucci plans to expand its distribution of the company s key grip product which are used in various sports including baseball, softball, cycling hockey and lacrosse. Additionally, Marucci sees opportunity to expand its grip offering into gaming and other similar applications, as well as batting gloves. 
 International Market Expansion - International sales currently represent a small portion of total sales. Natural expansion opportunities exist in baseball markets abroad such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Canada, and Latin America. Marucci has achieved profitable growth in Asia by leveraging its premium brands and accessing markets through proven team dealers and distributors. In late 2021, Marucci launched a Japan-based sales office. 
 Further Penetration of Softball Market - Marucci s plans to leverage its brand strength in baseball to further penetrate the softball market. Marucci is driving brand awareness and growth in the softball market from the ground up through grassroots marketing efforts, social media influencers, leveraging its partnerships with colleges and affiliated Marucci club teams, as well the recently launched softball mobile tour, to get in front of players of all ages. Marucci has dedicated employees who focus on softball expansion and have experience in the category as former collegiate athletes and coaches. 
 Expansion of the Direct-to-Team Sales Channel - The Direct-to-Team sales channel, launched in 2014, allows Marucci to sell its equipment and apparel directly to thousands of players. Marucci currently has 29 Founders Club organizations, representing 15,000 players. The Founders Club is an elite alliance of some of the nation s premier amateur baseball programs selected by Marucci for their dedication to excellence on and off the field, reputation as a positive influence in their community, and commitment to growing their organization. 
 Marucci s proprietary online platform for this channel, Locker Room , is ideal for any group that requires individual processing and purchasing. There is potential opportunity to leverage Locker Room capabilities across other team sports as the total market size for U.S. Team Sports Uniforms is approximately 1.3 billion. Marucci feels the DTT strategy is still in its early stages of growth. 
 Industry Consolidation - With a well-developed global supply chain, external and internal manufacturing capabilities, sophisticated management systems infrastructure, and extensive network of relevant relationships, Marucci is a platform for consolidation within both the baseball and softball equipment and apparel spaces. Management has identified a pipeline of potential acquisition targets that would help Marucci strengthen and expand its product offering and address new market segments. 
 39 

Competitive Strengths 
 Originally founded to focus on baseball and softball, Marucci has a unique strength with its authentic knowledge and experience of these sports. Whether leading the Company s strategy, cutting and sanding wood bats, or shipping product, the Marucci team consists largely of former players or coaches of the game itself. This same strategy extends to any category or market the company participates in so that the product is truly designed by the player for the player. 
 Product Development the product development cycle varies by product with bats taking approximately 16 months to reach distribution and batting gloves requiring approximately 9 months. New product development at Marucci occurs in six successive stages: (1) Identify Market Opportunity search for player needs via internal leads, supplier partners, or on-the ground feedback from players in their network, (2) Cross Functional Ideation host ongoing dialogue with sourcing partners to identify next-gen technology, (3) Product Development have sourcing partners begin preliminary testing runs once viable new products are identified, (4) Production and Validation continue rigorous prototyping and product validation on the field and in the Marucci performance lab where Big League and amateur players test and provide feedback, (5) Marketing engage in-house marketing team to drive product naming, rollout, branding, and marketing stories to expand awareness, and (6) Product Rollout and Distribution finalize the marketing story, conduct sales presentations, and provide samples to representatives and finally receiving orders from channel partners and beginning full production. 
 Leading Brands with Professional Halo Both Marucci and Victus products are preferred by Big League players (#1 and #2 bat brands in the Big Leagues, respectively), and Lizard Skins is the grip tape of choice for many top athletes at both the professional and amateur levels. Marucci s leading share of use among the top players at the top levels of baseball underlies the aspirational nature of the brand and creates a halo effect for its broader product lines, giving the brands credibility and permission to play in adjacent product categories, customer demographics, and geographic markets. 
 Vertical Integration Marucci owns its own wood mills, giving the company greater control over the availability and quality of the supply of wood billets used to produce its wood bats. Marucci s original value proposition to professional players was to guarantee that each bat delivered would meet the most stringent standards demanded for in-game use. As product tolerances continue to tighten and supply chain complexity creates operational challenges for many competitors, Marucci s ability to ensure both product quality and availability is a unique competitive advantage. 
 Competition 
 Marucci competes with offerings from multiple large baseball equipment manufacturers, including Easton (under the Easton and Rawlings brands) and Wilson Sporting Goods Company (under the Wilson, DeMarini, Louisville Slugger, and Evoshield brands), and numerous smaller wood bat specific brands including Old Hickory, Chandler Bats, Tucci, Dove Tail, Sam Bat, and D-Bat. Key determinants in consumer purchasing decisions include product performance, quality, and brand loyalty. 
 Suppliers 
 Marucci leverages a combination of sourcing and in-house manufacturing. Metal bats, apparel, batting gloves, fielding gloves, bags, and other accessories are sourced from an international network of primarily Asian manufacturing partners, while wood bats are manufactured domestically at the company s Baton Rouge (Marucci) and King of Prussia (Victus) facilities. In 2019, the company acquired two timber mills, effectively consolidating its wood bat supply chain to improve quality and production efficiency and ensuring continued access to the best wood in the game. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Marucci maintains 47 trademarks in the U.S., 41 of which are registered and 6 of which are pending registration. Marucci also has 1 issued patent. Management consider s its trademarked brand names, preeminent name recognition, ability to design innovative products, and technical and marketing expertise to be its primary competitive advantages. 
 Regulatory Environment 
 Baseball and softball equipment, outside of bats, enjoys a largely restriction free Federal/Local government regulatory framework. Metal bats used in youth and elite travel leagues are subject to strict regulations limiting 
 40 

spring and exit velocity determined by self-regulatory associations connected to the sport. There are three key regulatory groups associated with baseball: USA Baseball, United States Specialty Sports Association USSSA ), and Bat-Ball Coefficient of Restitution BBCOR ). Each have their own method for measuring bat performance. BBCOR is the standard currently governing adult baseball bats used in High School and Collegiate play while USA and USSSA govern youth leagues. There are also regulatory bodies specific to softball including Amateur Softball Association (ASA) and Independent Softball Association, among others. Wood bats used in professional baseball are subject to league-specific regulations. We believe all of Marucci's products adhere to established regulations 
 Seasonality 
 Marucci typically has higher sales in the first quarter each year, ahead of the primary baseball season. However, management expects seasonality to smooth out over time as baseball becomes an increasingly year-round sport. 
 Human Capital 
 Marucci had 328 employees at December 31, 2022, 272 full-time and 56 part-time employees, all located in the United States. Additionally, Marucci works with a third party Employer of Record in Japan to deploy its strategies in Asia and currently has 4 full-time employees. Marucci's labor force is non-union. Management believes that Marucci has a good relationship with its employees. 
 
 PrimaLoft 
 Overview 
 Based in Latham, New York, PrimaLoft is the leading provider of branded, high-performance synthetic insulation used primarily in consumer outerwear and accessories. PrimaLoft was developed in 1983 as a division of Albany International Corporation (NYSE: AIN) in response to a U.S. Army request to develop a synthetic insulation for soldiers that replicated the warmth and weight characteristics of traditional goose down, but also remained warm when wet. Today, PrimaLoft s products span a wide variety of highly engineered insulation fibers and gels that are used as ingredients for premium priced outdoor apparel (e.g., jackets, vests, pants, gloves, footwear, and hats) and home furnishings (e.g., comforters and pillows). PrimaLoft is differentiated based on its (i) leadership in synthetic insulation technology and sustainability, (ii) respected brand, (iii) robust product development and service model critical to brand partners, and (iv) respected legacy and high esteem with product design teams of aspirational brands. Most brand partners do not possess the same depth of internal expertise in synthetic insulation design and view PrimaLoft as an innovation and sustainability partner that enhances the parent brand in a manner consistent with increasingly eco-focused brand missions. 
 History of PrimaLoft 
 PrimaLoft was originally founded in 1983 after being approached by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory in Natick, Massachusetts. The U.S. Army was primarily interested in a synthetic insulation that would be comparable to goose down in weight, compressibility, and warmth, while also retaining heat in the presence of moisture. PrimaLoft was awarded its first patent for a synthetic down originally branded as PrimaLoft ONE in 1986. After initial success with military applications including sleeping bags and clothing systems, PrimaLoft entered the commercial market through partnerships with name brands like L.L. Bean, Land s End, and Ralph Lauren. PrimaLoft quickly established its credibility for performance and quality and today continues to drive innovation within the synthetic insulation industry. A summary of key milestones in the Company s history is below: 
 1989: L.L. Bean and Ralph Lauren become the first brand partners 
 1990: PrimaLoft was used in the layering system for the Mount Everest Peace Climb 
 1997: Developed first design using post-consumer recycled material 
 2012: Separation from Albany International into a standalone company through a management buyout 
 2017: Release of i) ThermoPlume, the most advanced, 100 recycled, down-like synthetic insulation alternative and ii) Aerogel technology, a lightweight, compression-resistant insulation composed of more than 95 air 
 2018: Developed first-ever biodegradable, 100 recycled synthetic insulation and fabric cross-product capabilities 
 2019: Partnership with Parley and Adidas to manufacture insulation from ocean plastics 
 41 

2019: Breakthrough development of P.U.R.E. manufacturing technology, a proprietary process of synthetic insulation that reduces carbon emissions by up to 70 
 2020: Launch of Patagonia Nano-Puff with PrimaLoft P.U.R.E. technology 
 2021: Launch of Aerogel Footwear with Canada Goose 
 2021: PrimaLoft Bio recognized as the winner of Drapers Sustainable Fashion Award 
 We acquired a majority interest in PrimaLoft on July 12, 2022. 
 Industry 
 PrimaLoft participates in the global insulation market for both apparel and bedding, which is estimated to encompass over 30 billion of annual spending. Within the overall insulation market, PrimaLoft competes primarily in premium positioned products where consumers value performance and sustainability. 
 Products, Customers and Distribution Channels 
 Products 
 PrimaLoft s core product offering includes a wide range of insulation product types that are optimized to keep end consumers at a comfortable temperature, regardless of weather conditions. At the top end of the product range, PrimaLoft s technically focused brand partners design each new outwear garment with specific performance goals or use cases in mind and aim to deliver the highest levels of warmth while also reducing product weight and maximizing product flexibility. PrimaLoft also delivers a broader menu of solutions to its brand partners that can address any product designer s aesthetic vision (e.g., quilted/non-quilted, high/low loft, loose fill/batted rolls, etc.). PrimaLoft has been an early advocate of apparel sustainability, becoming the exclusive partner to some of the largest and most pioneering sustainability focused outdoor brands when they first undertook meaningful sustainability initiatives. Additionally, under its Relentlessly Responsible mantra, PrimaLoft has innovated low-emission manufacturing processes, incorporated high levels of recycled content into its product lineup, and continues to push the boundaries of apparel circularity via biodegradation and carbon-negative technologies. The ability of PrimaLoft s product suite to address any and all brand partner goals, whether performance, aesthetic, or sustainability related, is a critical reason for PrimaLoft s consistent market leadership in synthetic insulation over the past four decades. 
 Customers and Distribution Channels 
 PrimaLoft primarily works directly with over 900 active brand partners across North America, Europe, and Asia. PrimaLoft maintains highly collaborative relationships with its brand partners, visiting most several times per year to introduce new innovations, generate new product ideas, and assist with integrating the latest PrimaLoft technologies into their outerwear lineups. The process of designing a jacket usually begins about 18 months before the jacket is intended to be sold at retail. PrimaLoft sales team members and engineers engage early in the process, assisting with garment design, construction, and analysis of key insulation performance attributes. After several rounds of sampling and iterating with PrimaLoft, the brand partner will finalize product bill of materials and quantities for its lineup. Outerwear featuring PrimaLoft is primarily sold through brick-and-mortar sporting goods retailers, specialty sport retailers, online retailers, or brand partners owned retail and online channels. 
 PrimaLoft had approximately 16.6 million in firm backlog orders at December 31, 2022. 
 Business Strategies and Competitive Conditions 
 Business Strategies 
 Accelerate the Market Trends Away from Down Insulation - With the introduction of ThermoPlume and other down-like synthetic insulation solutions, PrimaLoft is well positioned to continue gaining market share as customers shift away from down insulation. This change is being driven by the following factors: (i) consumer pushback on traditional down products due to the widespread and well-publicized inhumane down harvesting practices; (ii) narrowing performance gap between synthetic and down; (iii) volatility and notably higher pricing for down insulation tied to commodity pricing of goose and duck meat; and (iv) limited design flexibility and loss of efficacy in wet conditions for down insulation makes synthetic more attractive to product designers. 
 Continued Development of Cutting Edge Insulation Technology - Over the past four decades, PrimaLoft has continuously improved its product offering to remain a technology leader in synthetic insulation. With strong 
 42 

continued investment in new product development, we expect PrimaLoft innovations to push the boundaries of material science and expand the value provided to end consumers. 
 Competitive Strengths 
 PrimaLoft s competitive advantages include: (i) four decades of brand equity built on technology leadership, that allows brand partners to command premium pricing and tell their sustainability story; (ii) deep insulation-specific material science expertise ranging from polymer innovation to manufacturing innovation to design integration; (iii) protected intellectual property and a proprietary supply chain; (iv) trusted long standing brand partner relationships for a critical but relatively small cost component of the overall product; and (v) scale (demand aggregation) to command attention at both the fiber and toll manufacturing stages of the supply chain. 
 Competition 
 PrimaLoft s competition falls into two categories: (i) brand partner house insulation brands; and (ii) other third-party insulation manufacturers that service more than one outerwear brand. PrimaLoft is believed to be the largest third-party branded synthetic insulation provider to the apparel industry. 
 Research and Development 
 PrimaLoft adheres to a 5-step Stage Gate approach for developing new products, beginning with a concept phase to define the market need. PrimaLoft relies on R D alliances, industry contacts, and its internal technical team to identify and develop innovative ideas to address a market need. Once defined, the team enters a feasibility phase to scope the operations requirements and early pricing builds. PrimaLoft then begins an interactive process of designing and verifying the product against external and internal requirements. Once product attributes and pricing builds are finalized, PrimaLoft further validates the product and process performance within the production environment and finalizes marketing assets before ensuring steady state production at toll manufacturing partner facilities. 
 Suppliers 
 PrimaLoft leverages an asset-lite production model, relying on a global network of third-party chemical suppliers, extruders, and fiber mills strategically located near brand partner production facilities throughout Asia, Europe, and North America. PrimaLoft s vertically integrated supply chain is a competitive advantage, allowing for customized solutions to brand partners. Beginning at the polymer level, PrimaLoft possesses expertise in optimizing enhanced performance polymers. At the fiber extrusion level, PrimaLoft has the ability to innovate and create novel fibers, which are then used as inputs to the textile process. PrimaLoft provides fiber requirements and formulations to its network of exclusive manufacturing partners, who then directly receive raw materials ordered by PrimaLoft. PrimaLoft oversees the manufacturing partner insulation production process, often with visits to facilities and continuous testing to ensure all insulation produced meets the performance and sustainability standards. Once produced, the manufacturing partners ship insulation to brand partner manufacturing facilities, often located near the toll manufacturer in Europ e or Asia. The brand partner manufacturer then produces the final product before it is shipped back to the brand partner, to a retailer, or direct to a consumer. 
 Intellectual Property 
 In addition to its brand, customer relationships and scale, PrimaLoft also makes use of product patents and process trade secrets as additional barriers to entry and competitive moats. As a leader in synthetic insulation PrimaLoft has built a patent portfolio of more than 25 issued and pending patents in the United States and more than 75 patents issued internationally. In addition, PrimaLoft uses a variety of trade secrets typically covering specific insulation manufacturing processes. Lastly, PrimaLoft has more than 50 registered and pending trademarks globally. 
 Seasonality 
 Due to the nature of insulated outwear and the concentration of spending in the northern hemisphere, PrimaLoft typically sees approximately 70 of sales in the first half of the calendar year, which is when brand partners order components to be used in cold weather apparel that will be sold to end consumers in the subsequent fall/winter.

 Competitive Conditions 
 Airguns - Velocity's airgun line competes with offerings from several airgun manufacturers, including Daisy Outdoor Products, Gamo Outdoor USA (which acquired Daisy in July 2016 but remains separately branded), and Germany-based Umarex. The market for airguns is relatively concentrated, led by Crosman, Daisy, Gamo, and Umarex, according to Sports OneSource data. Key determinants in consumer purchasing decisions include product performance, quality, and brand loyalty. 
 Archery - The archery market competes within a good, better, best spectrum. Velocity's CenterPoint product line, as a value-for-price, entry to mid-level brand, tends to lie between the good and better segments, competing with Barnett Outdoors, Killer Instinct, and PSE Technologies, among others. Consumers tend to make purchasing decisions based on brand awareness, reliability, customer service, and pricing. Although CenterPoint is a recent entry into the archery market, the brand has been able to outpace more established brands on the reliability, pricing, and service aspects to win market share. The Ravin product line has a higher price point and falls within the "best" segment for crossbows, competing with the higher end Tenpoint crossbows. Ravin entered the market in 2017 and management believes it has since become the number one selling brand as measured by retail dollars. 
 Suppliers and Manufacturing 
 Suppliers 
 Velocity s supply chain has both a domestic and foreign sourced component, where sourcing decisions are based on manufacturing expertise, cost, lead time, demand requirements as well as other factors. Finished goods manufacturing is balanced between domestic and offshore, largely from the Asia Pacific region. In addition to a well-seasoned supply chain team in the United States, Velocity Outdoor employs an Asian based Supply Chain team to support current sourced product and future growth. In general, raw materials utilized in Velocity s products include steel, lead, plastics, and corrugated materials. There is ample capacity throughout the value-chain to fully support growth objectives.

Management considers its patent holdings, trademarked brand names, preeminent name recognition, ability to design innovative products, and technical and marketing expertise to be its primary competitive advantages. 
 48 

Regulatory Environment 
 Airguns - Airguns enjoy a relatively unrestrictive federal regulatory framework, with most regulations determined at the state level. Although there are no federal laws regulating their transfer, possession or use, non-powder guns are subject to oversight from the Consumer Product Safety Commission CSPC ). Therefore, airguns are subject to generalized statutory limitations involving substantial product hazard and articles that pose a substantial risk of injury to children, though the CSPC has not adopted specific mandatory regulations in this area. Federal law prevents states from prohibiting the sale of airguns but allows for state-by-state restrictions on sales of airguns to minors. Thirteen states have imposed such restrictions. Historically, there have not been attempts to grandfather the regulation of airguns into that of traditional powdered firearms, as legislative efforts have largely focused on responding to and refining the existing regulatory framework for each respective category rather than overhauling the coordination or transfer of enforcement duties across agencies. 
 Archery - Crossbow hunting restrictions have become less stringent over the last several years. Since 2006, 12 states, including populous hunting states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina, have legalized crossbow hunting, while many others moved to relax restrictions through the opening of limited seasons or creation of exceptions to hunting restrictions for those with disabilities. Today, only Oregon classifies crossbows as illegal but there is currently a proposal to allow crossbows during the all-weapon deer season in the eastern half of the state. Nearly 90 of all hunting permits are filed in states that currently allow crossbow hunting for at least part of the season. Although continued deregulation is expected, it likely will not be the largest driver for the crossbow category moving forward. Participation levels have steadily increased within the states.This, as well as consumer centric innovation that improves the hunting experience, will be the main drivers behind market growth. 
 Seasonality 
 Velocity typically has higher sales in the third and fourth quarter each year, reflecting the hunting and holiday seasons, respectively. 
 Human Capital 
 Velocity had 356 employees on December 31, 2022, 321 full-time employees and 35 part-time employees, with 355 employees located within the United States. Velocity s labor force i s non-union. Management believes that Velocity has a good relationship with its employees. 
 
 Niche Industrial Businesses 
 
 Advanced Circuits 
 Overview 
 Advanced Circuits, headquartered in Aurora, Colorado, is a provider of small-run, quick-turn and production rigid printed circuit boards ("PCBs"), throughout the United States. Advanced Circuits also provides its customers with assembly services in order to meet its customers complete PCB needs. The small-run and quick-turn portions of the PCB industry are characterized by customers requiring high levels of responsiveness, technical support and timely delivery. Due to the critical roles that PCBs play in the research and development process of electronics, customers often place more emphasis on the turnaround time and quality of a customized PCB than on the price. Advanced Circuits meets this market need by manufacturing and delivering custom PCBs in as little as 24 hours, providing customers with over 98 error-free production and real-time customer service and product tracking 24 hours per day. 
 History of Advanced Circuits 
 Advanced Circuits commenced operations in 1989 through the acquisition of a small Denver-based PCB manufacturer. During its first years of operations, Advanced Circuits focused exclusively on manufacturing high volume, production run PCBs with a small group of proportionately large customers. After the loss of a significant customer in the early 1990s, Advanced Circuits began focusing on developing a diverse customer base, and in particular, on meeting the demands of equipment manufacturers with low-volume, high-margin, customized small-run and quick-turn PCBs. 
 We purchased a controlling interest in Advanced Circuits on May 16, 2006. Since our acquisition, Advanced Circuits has completed several add-on acquisitions that expanded their customer base in various industries and sectors, 
 49 

including the aerospace and defense industry and the long-lead sector. Over 50 of Advanced Circuits sales are derived from highly profitable small-run and quick-turn production PCBs. Advanced Circuits success is demonstrated by its broad base of over 11,000 customers that it does business with throughout the year. 
 On January 10, 2023, we entered into an agreement to sell Advanced Circuits. The sale was completed on February 14, 2023. Refer to Note S - S ubsequent Events for a description of the transaction. 
 Industry 
 The PCB industry, which consists of both large global PCB manufacturers and small regional PCB manufacturers, is a vital component to all electronic equipment supply chains, as PCBs serve as the foundation for virtually all electronic products, including cellular telephones, appliances, personal computers, routers, switches and network servers. PCBs are used by manufacturers of these types of electronic products, as well as by persons and teams engaged in research and development of new types of equipment and technologies. 
 Several significant trends are present within the PCB manufacturing industry. Production of PCBs in North America has declined in recent years due to increased competition for volume production of PCBs from Asian competitors benefiting from both lower labor costs and less restrictive waste and environmental regulations. Asian based manufacturers of PCBs are capitalizing on their lower labor costs and increasing their market share of volume production PCBs, which are used in high volume consumer electronics application such as computers and cell phones. This offshoring of high-volume production orders has placed increased pricing pressure and margin compression on many small domestic manufacturers that are no longer operating at full capacity. Many of these small producers are choosing to cease operations, rather than operate at a loss, as their scale, plant design and customer relationships do not allow them to focus profitably on the small-run and quick-turn sectors of the market. While Asian manufacturers have made large market share gains in the PCB industry overall, small-run and quick-turn production, some of the more complex volume production, and military production have remained strong in the United States. Rapid advances in technology are significantly shortening product life-cycles and placing increased pressure on original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") to develop new products in shorter periods of time. In response to these pressures, OEMs invest heavily in research and development, which results in a demand for PCB companies that can offer engineering support and quick-turn production services to minimize the product development process. Additionally, increased complexity of electronic equipment requires maintaining the production infrastructure necessary to manufacture PCBs of increasing complexity. This often requires significant capital expenditures and has acted to reduce the competitiveness of local and regional PCB manufacturers lacking the scale to make such investments. 
 Both globally and domestically, the PCB market can be separated into three categories based on required lead time and order volume: 
 Small-run PCBs These PCBs are typically manufactured for customers in research and development departments of OEMs and academic institutions. Small-run PCBs are manufactured to the specifications of the customer, within certain manufacturing guidelines designed to increase speed and reduce production costs. Prototyping is a critical stage in the research and development of new products. These small-runs are used in the design and launch of new electronic equipment and are typically ordered in volumes of 1 to 50 PCBs. Because the small-run is used primarily in the research and development phase of a new electronic product, the life cycle is relatively short and requires accelerated delivery time frames of usually less than five days and very high, error-free quality. Order, production and delivery time, as well as responsiveness with respect to each, are key factors for customers as PCBs are indispensable to their research and development activities. 
 Quick-Turn Production PCBs These PCBs are used for intermediate stages of testing for new products prior to full scale production. After a new product has successfully completed the small-run phase, customers undergo test marketing and other technical testing. This stage requires production of larger quantities of PCBs in a short period of time, generally 10 days or less, while it does not yet require high production volumes. This transition stage between low-volume small-run production and volume production is known as quick-turn production. Manufacturing specifications conform strictly to end product requirements and order quantities are typically in volumes of 10 to 500. Similar to small-run PCBs, response time remains crucial as the delivery of quick-turn PCBs can be a gating item in the development of electronic products. Orders for quick-turn production PCBs conform specifically to the customer s exact end product requirements. 
 50 

Volume Production PCBs These PCBs, which we sometimes refer to as long lead and sub-contract are used in the full scale production of electronic equipment and specifications conform strictly to end product requirements. Volume Production PCBs are ordered in large quantities, usually over 100 units, and response time is less important, ranging between 15 days to 10 weeks or more. 
 These categories can be further distinguished based on board complexity, with each portion facing different competitive threats. Advanced Circuits competes largely in the small-run and quick-turn production portions of the North American market, which have not been significantly impacted by Asian-based manufacturers due to the quick response time required for these products. 
 Products and Services 
 A PCB is comprised of layers of laminate and contains patterns of electrical circuitry to connect electronic components. Advanced Circuits typically manufactures 2 to 20 layer PCBs, and has the capability to manufacture even higher layer PCBs. The level of PCB complexity is determined by several characteristics, including size, layer count, density (line width and spacing), materials and functionality. Beyond complexity, a PCB s unit cost is determined by the quantity of identical units ordered, as engineering and production setup costs per unit decrease with order volume, and required production time, as longer times often allow increased efficiencies and better production management. Advanced Circuits primarily manufactures lower complexity PCBs. 
 Advanced Circuits assists its customers throughout the life-cycle of their products, from product conception through volume production. Advanced Circuits works closely with customers throughout each phase of the PCB development process, beginning with the PCB design verification stage using its unique online tool, FreeDFM.com , which enables customers to receive a free manufacturability assessment report within minutes, resolving design problems that would prohibit manufacturability before the order process is completed and manufacturing begins. The combination of Advanced Circuits user-friendly website and its design verification tool reduces the amount of human labor involved in the manufacture of each order as PCBs move from Advanced Circuits website directly to its computer numerical control, or CNC, machines for production, saving Advanced Circuits and customers cost and time. As a result of its ability to rapidly and reliably respond to the critical customer requirements, Advanced Circuits receives a premium for their small-run and quick-turn PCBs as compared to volume production PCBs. 
 Advanced Circuits manufactures all high margin small-runs and quick-turn orders internally and occasionally utilizes external partners to manufacture production orders that do not fit within its capabilities or capacity constraints at a given time. As a result, Advanced Circuits constantly adjusts the portion of volume production PCBs produced internally to both maximize profitability and ensure that internal capacity is fully utilized. 
 The following table shows Advanced Circuits gross revenue by products and services for the periods indicated:

 Competitive Strengths 
 Advanced Circuits has established itself as a leading provider of small-run and quick-turn PCBs in North America and focuses on satisfying customer demand for on-time delivery of high-quality PCBs. Advanced Circuits management believes the following factors differentiate it from many industry competitors: 
 Numerous Unique Orders Per Day Advanced Circuits receives on average over 165 customer orders per day. Due to the large quantity of orders received, Advanced Circuits is able to combine multiple orders in a single panel design prior to production. Through this process, Advanced Circuits is able to reduce the number of costly, labor intensive equipment set-ups required to complete several manufacturing orders. As 
 51 

labor represents the single largest cost of production, management believes this capability gives Advanced Circuits a unique advantage over other industry participants. 
 Diverse Customer Base Advanced Circuits possesses a customer base with little industry or customer concentration exposure. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Advanced Circuits had two customers that each represented more than 5 of net sales. For each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Advanced Circuits had one customer that represented more than 5 of net sales. 
 Highly Responsive Culture and Organization A key strength of Advanced Circuits is its ability to quickly respond to customer orders and complete the production process. In contrast to many competitors that require a day or more to offer price quotes on small-run or quick-turn production, Advanced Circuits offers its customers quotes within seconds and the ability to place or track orders any time of day. In addition, Advanced Circuits production facility operates three shifts per day and is able to ship a customer s product within 24 hours of receiving its order. 
 Proprietary FreeDFM.com TM Software Advanced Circuits offers its customers unique design verification services through its online FreeDFM.com tool. This tool enables customers to receive a free manufacturability assessment report, within minutes, resolving design problems before customers place their orders. The service is relied upon by many of Advanced Circuits customers to reduce design errors and minimize production costs. Beyond improved customer service, FreeDFM.com TM has the added benefit of improving the efficiency of Advanced Circuits engineers, as many routine design problems, which typically require an engineer s time and attention to identify, are identified and sent back to customers automatically. 
 Established Partner Network Advanced Circuits has established third party production relationships with PCB manufacturers in North America and Asia. Through these relationships, Advanced Circuits is able to offer its customers a complete suite of products including those outside of its core production capabilities. Additionally, these relationships allow Advanced Circuits to outsource orders for volume production and focus internal capacity on higher margin, short lead time, production and quick-turn manufacturing. 
 Business Strategies 
 Advanced Circuits management is focused on strategies to increase market share and further improve operating efficiencies. The following is a discussion of these strategies: 
 Increase Portion of Revenue from Small-run and Quick-Turn Production Advanced Circuits management believes it can grow revenues and cash flow by continuing to leverage its core small-run and quick-turn capabilities. Over its history, Advanced Circuits has developed a suite of capabilities that management believes allow it to offer a combination of price and customer service unequaled in the market. Advanced Circuits intends to leverage this factor, as well as its core skill set, to increase net sales derived from higher margin small-run and quick-turn production PCBs. 
 Acquire Customers from Local and Regional Competitors Advanced Circuits management believes the majority of its competition for small-run and quick-turn PCB orders comes from smaller scale local and regional PCB manufacturers. Advanced Circuits continues to enter into small-run and quick-turn manufacturing relationships with several subscale local and regional PCB manufacturers. Management believes that while many of these manufacturers maintain strong, long-standing customer relationships, they are unable to produce PCBs with short turn-around times at competitive prices. As a result, Advanced Circuits sees an opportunity for growth by providing production support to these manufacturers or direct support to the customers of these manufacturers, whereby the manufacturers act more as a broker for the relationship. 
 
 Remain Committed to Customers and Employees Advanced Circuits has remained focused on providing the highest quality products and services to its customers. Management believes this focus has allowed Advanced Circuits to achieve its outstanding delivery and quality record. Advanced Circuits management believes this reputation is a key competitive differentiator and is focused on maintaining and building upon it. Similarly, management believes its committed base of employees is a key differentiating factor. Management believes that Advanced Circuits emphasis on sharing rewards and creating a positive work environment has led to increased loyalty. Advanced Circuits plans to continue to focus on similar programs to maintain this competitive advantage. 
 Opportunistically Acquire Smaller PCB Manufacturers Historically, Advanced Circuits has selectively made tuck-in acquisitions of regional PCB manufacturers. Management will continue to seek tuck-in acquisitions of 
 52 

smaller PCB manufacturers where sales and operational efficiencies can be realized, or strategic technical capabilities expanded. 
 Manufacturing Facility Enhancement - In 2019, Advanced Circuits built out a new state-of-the-art printed circuit board manufacturing facility that will allow it to provide existing and new customers with enhanced capabilities. 
 Research and Development 
 Advanced Circuits engages in continual research and development activities in the ordinary course of business to update or strengthen its order processing, production and delivery systems. By engaging in these activities, Advanced Circuits expects to maintain and build upon the competitive strengths from which it benefits currently. Research and development expenses were not material in each of the last three years. 
 Customers and Distribution Channels 
 Advanced Circuits focus on customer service and product quality has resulted in a broad base of customers in a variety of end markets, including industrial, consumer, telecommunications, aerospace/defense, biotechnology and electronics manufacturing. These customers range in size from large, blue-chip manufacturers to small, not-for-profit university engineering departments. The following table sets forth management s estimate of Advanced Circuits approximate customer breakdown by industry sector for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020: 
 Customer Distribution Industry Sector 2022 2021 2020 Electrical Equipment and Components 24 20 20 Electronics Manufacturing Services 22 22 20 Industrial and Commercial Machinery 17 18 20 Educational Institutions 10 7 8 Transportation Equipment 7 8 5 Measuring Instruments 4 5 3 Engineer Services 2 5 2 Business Services 1 1 1 Wholesale Trade-Durable Goods 1 1 1 All Other Sectors Combined 12 13 20 Total 100 100 100 
 Management estimates that over 75 of its orders are generated from existing customers. Moreover, more than half of Advanced Circuits orders in each of the years 2022, 2021 and 2020 were delivered within five days (not including long-lead orders). 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Advanced Circuits has established a customer centric marketing strategy to both acquire new customers and retain existing customers. Advanced Circuits uses advanced digital marketing techniques such as search engine optimization, pay-per-click, content marketing, segmented email marketing, social media marketing, web banners and behavioral retargeting. In addition to digital marketing Advanced Circuits runs aggressive pricing promotions and proactive outbound calling sales campaigns. Advanced Circuits spends approximately 1 of net sales each year on its marketing initiatives and advertising and has inside and outside sales professionals organized geographically throughout North America dedicated to its marketing and sales efforts. Beyond proactive customer acquisition initiatives, management believes a substantial portion of new customers are acquired through referrals from existing customers. In addition, other customers are acquired online where Advanced Circuits generates over 60 of its orders from its website. Substantially all revenue is derived from sales within the United States. 
 Advanced Circuits, due to the volume of small-run and quick turn sales, had a negligible amount in firm backlog orders at December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 53 

Competition 
 There are currently an estimated 160 active domestic PCB manufacturers. Advanced Circuits competitors differ amongst its products and services. 
 Competitors in the small-run and quick-turn PCBs production industry include larger companies as well as small domestic manufacturers. The largest independent domestic small-run and quick-turn PCB manufacturer in North America is TTM Technologies, Inc. Though this company produces small-run PCBs to varying degrees, in many ways it is not a direct competitor with Advanced Circuits. In recent years, larger competitors have primarily focused on producing boards with greater complexity in response to the offshoring of low and medium layer count technology to Asia. Compared to Advanced Circuits, small-run and quick-turn PCB production accounts for much smaller portions of larger competitors' revenues. Further, these competitors often have much greater customer concentrations and a greater portion of sales through large electronics manufacturing services intermediaries. Beyond large, public companies, Advanced Circuits competitors include numerous small local and regional manufacturers, often with revenues under 20 million. These smaller competitors have long-term customer relationships and typically produce both small-run and quick-turn PCBs and production PCBs for small OEMs and EMS companies. The competitive factors in small-run and quick-turn production PCBs are response time, quality, error-free production and customer service. Competitors in the long lead-time production PCBs generally include large companies, including Asian manufacturers, where price is the key competitive factor. 
 New market entrants into small-run and quick-turn production PCBs confront substantial barriers including significant investments in equipment, securing a highly skilled workforce with extensive engineering knowledge and compliance with environmental regulations. Beyond these tangible barriers, Advanced Circuits management believes that its network of customers, established over the last two decades, would be very difficult for a competitor to replicate. 
 Suppliers 
 Advanced Circuits raw materials inventory is small relative to sales and must be regularly and rapidly replenished. Advanced Circuits uses a just-in-time procurement practice to maintain raw materials inventory at low levels. Additionally, Advanced Circuits has established consignment relationships with several vendors allowing it to pay for raw materials as used. Because it provides primarily lower-volume quick-turn services, this inventory policy does not hamper its ability to complete customer orders. 
 The primary raw materials that are used in production are core materials, such as copper clad layers of glass and chemical solutions, and copper and gold for plating operations, photographic film and carbide drill bits. Multiple suppliers and sources exist for all materials. Adequate amounts of all raw materials have been available in the past, and Advanced Circuits management believes this will continue in the foreseeable future. Advanced Circuits works closely with its suppliers to incorporate technological advances in the raw materials they purchase. Advanced Circuits does not believe that it has significant exposure to fluctuations in raw material prices. The fact that price is not the primary factor affecting the purchase decision of many of Advanced Circuits customers has allowed management to historically pass along a portion of raw material price increases to its customers. Advanced Circuits does not knowingly purchase material originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Advanced Circuits seeks to protect certain proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with its employees, consultants and customers, as needed, and generally limits access to and distribution of its proprietary information and processes. Advanced Circuits management does not believe that patents are critical to protecting Advanced Circuits core intellectual property, but, rather, its effective and quick execution of fabrication techniques, its website FreeDFM.com and its highly skilled workforce are the primary factors in maintaining its competitive position. 
 Advanced Circuits uses the following brand names: FreeDFM.com , 4pcb.com , 4PCB.com , 33each.com , barebonespcb.com and Advanced Circuits . These trade names have strong brand equity and are material to Advanced Circuits business. 
 Regulatory Environment 
 Advanced Circuits manufacturing operations and facilities are subject to evolving federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. These include laws and regulations 
 54 

governing air emissions, wastewater discharge and the storage and handling of chemicals and hazardous substances. Management believes that Advanced Circuits is in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. New requirements, more stringent application of existing requirements, or discovery of previously unknown environmental conditions may result in material environmental expenditures in the future. Advanced Circuits has been recognized multiple times for exemplary environmental compliance and has been consistently awarded the Denver Metro Wastewater Reclamation District Gold Award. 
 Human Capital 
 Advanced Circuits h ad 391 employ ees at December 31, 2022 operating out of three production facilities in the United States. Advanced Circuits believes that it has a good relationship with its employees.

 We purchas ed Altor on February 15, 2018. 
 Industry 
 Altor competes in the broadly defined global protective packaging market which we estimate was approximately 30 billion in 2021, with foam materials making up the largest component of this market. On the basis of product type, this market is segmented into rigid protective, flexible protective, and foam protective applications. Altor primarily competes in the North American foam protective packaging market which includes expanded polyurethane foams, loose fills, foam in place polyurethane, and molded foams products. Producers of molded foam products generally fall into two categories: block molders and shape molders. Block molders manufacture large blocks of EPS foam that are typically used as insulation in building products such as walls, roofs and floors and are closely tied to the construction market. Shape molders, such as Altor, manufacture customized molded foam solutions for protective packaging applications, insulated shipping containers and internal parts and components for OEMs. Products made of EPS foam have broad applications across various end markets due to a unique combination of performance characteristics. The superior cushioning and barrier properties paired with insulating and hydrophobic properties make it an ideal material for protective packaging of heavy or valuable goods as well as insulated shipping containers for temperature and moisture sensitive products.

Products, Customers and Distribution Channels 
 Products 
 Altor Solutions designs and manufactures a broad array of custom molded protective foam solutions and OEM components serving various end markets. Altor's molded foam products are predominately made of expandable polystyrene (EPS), which is a rigid, closed-cell foam. EPS is comprised of polystyrene, a thermoplastic derived from the styrene monomer and benzene, and an added expansion agent, usually pentane. The final shape mold finished product is 98 air and is created in a low-pressure press which heats EPS beads that expand and fill a customer-specific mold. Altor also uses other moldable materials including expandable polypropylene (EPP) and expandable polyethylene (EPE) depending on project and customer requirements. EPS foam is an environmentally friendly material that is fully recyclable, uses less energy to produce, generates fewer emissions and has less environmental impact than most competitive material options. 
 Altor Solutions custom-engineered molded foam products fall into four major categories: protective packaging, insulated shipping containers, OEM parts and componentry and fabricated foam. These products are used across a variety of end markets including consumer electronics, appliances, temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals and food, automotive, home and office furnishings and building products among others. 
 Protective Packaging - Altor Solutions creates custom molded corner pads, edge pads, clear-view packages and other protective foam packaging solutions for durable goods such as large and counter-top appliances, furniture, consumer electronics and military applications. Molded foam is an ideal protective packaging choice because it can be shaped into almost any form at tight tolerances and provides lightweight yet strong cushioning during product shipment. 
 Insulated Shipping Containers - Transporting healthcare and pharmaceutical products requires complex logistical processes, specific equipment, storage facilities and special handling procedures to maintain product integrity. These requirements make EPS foam an ideal material to be used in insulated shipping containers due to its thermal insulation, water impermeability and shock absorbing properties. Similar to its uses in the healthcare industry, Altor manufactures insulated shipping containers for online grocers and meal delivery services to transport prepared meals and perishable food and beverage products that must be shipped in a temperature-controlled environment. 
 OEM Parts and Componentry - Altor Solutions manufactures a variety of internal components used by OEMs as replacements for injection molded plastic or sheet metal parts across various end-markets. Compared to traditional plastic parts, foam offers vibration protection, insulation benefits, lower tooling costs and shorter lead times. Altor offers thin-wall molded air ducts and other internal components for household appliances such as refrigerators and air conditioners. In the automotive sector, Altor manufactures foam door panels, trunk liners, bumper components, instrument panels, center consoles, side pillars, seat components and head rests. Foam is increasingly being used in new vehicle designs because it offers equivalent impact strength and toughness to traditional chassis materials with 10 to 40 less weight. Altor also makes products used in personal watercraft flotation and seating parts as well as recreational vehicle roof panels and core laminates that go underneath aluminum outer skins. Lastly, Altor produces building products for the construction market including insulated concrete forms. Insulated concrete forms are hollow sections of molded foam that construction crews stack into the shape of the walls of a building and fill with concrete to create the permanent structure. 
 Fabricated Foam - Altor Solutions also uses a variety of methods including die cutting, saw cutting, hot wire slicing and pressure cutting to create fabricated foam shapes as opposed to molded shapes. These products do not require tooling or dies so there is less upfront costs for the customer and are usually best suited for medium to low volume projects. Fabricated foam products represent a small portion of Altor overall net sales. 
 Customers and Distribution Channels 
 Altor Solutions maintains a broad base of over 300 customers across a wide variety of end-markets, including appliances, pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, consumer electronics, automotive, furniture, building products and logistics.

 Competitive Strengths 
 National Scale and Proximity to Customers - Altor Solutions maintains a national footprint of 18 manufacturing locations across North America. Facilities are strategically located near customers production locations enabling Altor to be one of only a few foam molders capable of serving large national accounts. Due to foam s high volume-to-weight ratio, foam manufacturers generally confine product shipments to a 300-mile radius in which shipping costs are economically viable. Thus, Altor is uniquely positioned to provide multi-facility support to its largest customers who often have multiple manufacturing or distribution locations. 
 Engineering and Design Capabilities - Altor Solutions has five coordinated design and testing centers with experienced packaging and mechanical engineers that work closely with customers to support packaging design needs. Engineering services include optimizing molds to meet customer needs and address complex design requirements, identifying pre-manufacturing challenges, solving post-manufacturing issues, improving packaging processes and laboratory testing final designs. Early customer involvement and collaboration to develop packaging solutions has resulted in increased project win rates and better visibility into product development pipelines. 
 Barriers to Entry 
 High Customer Switching Costs - The operational risk and disruption associated with switching existing molds to operate on a competitor s press makes shifting or splitting business between different shape molders difficult and infrequent. In general, most customers pay for their own molds, which are custom built for a specific molders presses. The financial cost of retooling is estimated to be 5,000 - 25,000 per mold, making it cost prohibitive to change molders on existing projects. 
 57 

Favorable Cost-to-value Proposition - The high cost of failure, relatively low proportionate cost of foam to the final product being protected, and a sometimes lengthy testing and qualification process represent significant barriers to customers changing solution providers or packaging material choices. 
 Equipment and Processing Infrastructure - Altor's existing base of production equipment has a significant estimated replacement cost. Management estimates the cost of opening a new shape molding facility at approximately 5 million, excluding real estate, and it must meet stringent environmental standards. A new entrant could require as much as 1-2 years of lead time to match the process performance requirements, customization of equipment and material formulations necessary to effectively compete in the molded foam industry. Moreover, Altor has a strong preventive maintenance program and in-house equipment division that is responsible for repairing and rebuilding presses. This allows Altor to significantly extend the average useful life of its machinery and reduce the ongoing capital investment requirements, creating an advantage over competitors. 
 Suppliers and Manufacturing 
 The primary raw materials that are used in production are plastic resins, such as expandable polystyrene (EPS), expandable polypropylene (EPP) and expandable polyethylene (EPE). In addition to plastic resins, Altor also purchases fabricating material including blocks of EPE and EPP foam, polyethylene and urethane, as well as other packaging materials including corrugate, boxes, paperboard, tape and plastic film. Altor purchases its materials from a combination of domestic and foreign suppliers and has maintained strong relationships with key resin suppliers for over 30 years. Adequate amounts of all raw materials have been available in the past, and Altor's management believes this will continue in the foreseeable future. 
 Altor m aintains 18 manufacturing facilities across North America with 16 located in the U.S. and 2 in Mexi co, as well as one non-manufacturing corporate headquarters. Given the high volume, low density nature of foam, Altor's manufacturing facilities are strategically located near its largest customers production locations to minimize freight and logistics costs. Altor's geographic footprint covers a large portion of the continental U.S. and Mexico. Each plant has a warehouse space for raw materials, supplies and finished goods. Several plants also use third-party warehousing to store excess inventory. Altor uses common carriers to deliver finished product and in certain cases, some customers pick up directly from the plants. 
 Regulatory Environment 
 Altor's manufacturing operations and facilities are subject to federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. These include laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharge and the storage and handling of chemicals and hazardous materials. 
 Human Capital 
 As of December 31, 2022, Altor employed 835 full-time employees. None of Altor's U.S.-based employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.

 History of Arnold 
 Arnold was founded in 1895 as the Arnold Electric Power Station Company. Arnold began producing AlNiCo permanent magnets in its Marengo, Illinois facility in the mid-1930s. In 1946, Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corporation (Allegheny) purchased Arnold, and over the next few years began production of several additional magnetic product lines under license agreement with the Western Electric Company. In 1970, Arnold acquired Ogallala Electronics, which manufactured high power coils and electromagnets. 
 SPS Technologies (SPS), at the time a publicly traded company, purchased Arnold Engineering Company from Allegheny in 1986. Under SPS, Arnold made a series of acquisitions and partnerships to expand its portfolio and geographic reach. In 2003, Precision Castparts, also a publicly traded company, acquired SPS. In January 2005, Audax, a Boston-based private equity firm acquired Arnold from Precision Castparts. 
 In February 2007, Arnold Magnetic Technologies completed the acquisition of Precision Magnetics, which expanded its geographic footprint to include operations in Sheffield, England and Lupfig, Switzerland. In addition, Arnold s Lupfig, Switzerland operation is a joint venture partner with a Chinese rare earth producer. The joint venture manufactures RECOMA Samarium Cobalt blocks for select markets. 
 In 2016, Arnold developed and launched the world s strongest Samarium Cobalt magnet grade, RECOMA 35E, that enables significant opportunity for increased performance in smaller packages, and at higher temperatures, with no trade off in stability. 
 Through 2018 and 2019, Arnold deployed more advanced material from its PTM group such as Arnon 2 and 4 gauge electrical steels along with advanced performance molypermalloy metals. Advancements from the PMAG group during this same timeframe were targeted at magnet retention in high performance applications. The result of this hard work was the development of Carbon Fiber sleeving capabilities at its Sheffield UK facility. Lastly, Flexmag also introduced customized highly loaded composite materials for a variety of applications. In 2021, Arnold acquired Ramco Electric Motors, Inc. ("Ramco"), a provider of custom electric motor solutions for general industrial, aerospace and defense and oil and gas end markets. Ramco's complementary product portfolio will allow Arnold to offer more comprehensive, turn-key solutions to their customers. In 2022, we expanded tech center operations to Europe.

Other Permanent Magnet Types 
 AlNiCo - The AlNiCo family of magnets remains a preferred material for many mission critical applications. Its favorable linear temperature characteristics, high magnetic flux density and good corrosion resistance are ideally suited for use in applications requiring magnetic stability. This material is manufactured by Arnold in the United States, making it a DFARS compliant material. 
 Hard Ferrite - Hard ferrite (ceramic) magnets were developed as a low cost alternative to metallic magnets (steel and AlNiCo). Although they exhibit lower energy when compared to other materials available today and are relatively brittle, ferrite magnets have gained acceptance due to their low price per magnetic output. 
 Injection Molded - Injection molded magnets are a composite of various types of resin and magnetic powders. The physical and magnetic properties of the product depend on the raw materials, but are generally lower in magnetic strength and resemble plastics in their physical properties. However, a major benefit of the injection molding process is that magnet material can be injection or over-molded, eliminating subsequent manufacturing steps.

Sterno Home with Rimports to leverage the capabilities of Rimports operations for profitability and growth. Previously, Sterno Home was a separate product division of Sterno whose product offerings include flameless candles, traditional house and garden lighting including path lights, spotlights, and security lights. 
 History of Sterno 
 Sterno s history dates back to 1893 when S. Sternau Co. began making chafing dishes and coffee percolators in Tenafly, New Jersey. In 1914, S. Sternau Co. introduced canned heat with the launch of its gelled ethanol product under the Sterno brand. Since then, the Sternau and Sterno names have been the most well-known names in portable food warming fuel. In 1917, S. Sternau Co. was renamed The Sterno Corporation. During World War I, Sterno portable stoves were promoted as an essential gift for soldiers going to fight in the trenches of Europe. Sterno stoves heated water and rations, sterilized surgical instruments, and provided light and warmth in bunkers and foxholes. During World War II, Sterno produced ethanol and methanol chafing fuels under contract with the U.S. military. Sterno's production facilities were moved from New Jersey to Texarkana, Texas in the early 1980s. In 2012, Sterno merged with the Candle Lamp Company, LLC ("CandleLamp"). CandleLamp, founded in Riverside, California in 1978, focused initially on the liquid wax candle market. Over the next several decades, CandleLamp began to supply chafing fuel in addition to lighting products. 
 In 2016, Sterno expanded their product offering with the acquisition of Northern International Inc. ("Sterno Home"). The success in the outdoor lighting of an innovative use of LED technology evolved into the development of patented flameless candle product line. In February 2018, Sterno acquired Rimports, a manufacturer and distributor of branded and private label wickless candle products used for home decor and fragrance systems. Rimports offers unique lines of wickless candle products including ceramic wax warmers, scented wax cubes and essential oil and diffusers. In 2022, the combination of Sterno Home and Rimports created opportunities for cost savings and strong business synergies. 
 Today, Sterno operates out of its corporate headquarters in Corona, California, two manufacturing facilities in Texarkana, Texas and Memphis, Tennessee, and the Rimports facility in Provo, Utah. 
 We purchased Sterno on October 10, 2014. 
 Industry 
 Sterno Products competes in the broadly defined U.S. foodservice industry where historically restaurant, catering and hospitality sales have accounted for approximately 60 - 70 of the market with the remainder comprised of the travel and leisure, education and healthcare related sales. The Sterno Products product offerings focus on safe, portable fire solutions for cooking and warming, as well as tabletop lighting d cor. 
 Rimports operates in the broad North American and United Kingdom home decor space (retail) which is heavily correlated to general consumer spending. Flameless and reusable wax products have seen increased adoption by younger consumers who prioritize economical and environmentally friendly products. Within the home decor space, 
 66 

Rimports competes in the U.S. candle space and the U.S. home fragrance space, and, with the integration of Sterno Home, has added the flameless candles, lanterns and outdoor lighting industry. Management believes that a rise in demand from high-income households and businesses will bolster growth, with consumers spending more money on the cocooning trend and specifically on beautifying their indoor and outdoor home, changing out trendy accent items more frequently and investing in more spacious and comfortable outdoor spaces with many equivalent amenities of their indoor spaces. 
 Sterno is a full-line supplier offering a broad array of portable chafing fuels, table lighting, outdoor lighting products, wickless candles and fragrance products with approximately 4000 SKUs serving the foodservice and retail markets. Sterno originally focused on chafing fuel canned heat products and later expanded its offerings to include table ambiance products such as liquid wax, wax candles and votive lamps, as well as outdoor lighting with the acquisition of Sterno Home in 2016, and wax cubes and warmer products through its acquisition of Rimports. Sterno s products fall into six major categories: canned heat, catering equipment and butane products, table lighting, flameless candles and outdoor lighting, wickless candle and fragrance products. 
 Products, Customers and Distribution Channels 
 Products 
 Canned Heat - The canned heat product line is composed of various chafing fuels packaged in small, portable cans. The portable warming (canned heat) line is composed of wick-based and gel-based chafing fuels packaged in steel cans. These products are used by foodservice professionals in a variety of food serving and holding applications and are designed to keep food products at an optimal food-safe serving temperature of 140-165 Fahrenheit. The canned heat product line is composed of two subcategories: wick chafing fuel and gel chafing fuel. The subcategories are distinguished based on the type of chafing fuel being used; the four primary chafing fuels are diethylene glycol DEG ), propylene glycol, ethanol and methanol. Each fuel contains unique characteristics and properties that allow the Company to offer a broad array of configurations to suit varying user requirements. 
 Wick Chafing Fuel - The wick chafing fuel line Wick is composed of either DEG or propylene glycol chafing fuel. DEG and propylene glycol chafing fuels with advance wick technology have higher heat output than alternatives such as ethanol and methanol. The liquid Wick products feature a variety of wick types and burn times to meet the specific needs of the user. Wick fuels are clean burning, biodegradable, nonflammable if spilled (will not ignite without a wick) and the can stays cool to the touch when lit. 
 Gel Chafing Fuel - The gel chafing fuel line Gel is composed of either gelled ethanol or gelled methanol chafing fuel. Ethanol chafing fuel has a higher heat output than methanol fuel; both ethanol and methanol fuels have lower heat output than some DEG and propylene glycol products. The Gel product line tends to have shorter burn times than the Wick product. 
 For an environmentally preferred chafing fuel, the Company offers a patented line of Green chafing fuels featuring USDA Certified Biobased Product formulas that are also endorsed by the Green Restaurant Association. The Green Heat and Green Wick products perform similar to the Wick and Gel chafing fuels, but are made from renewable resources that are biodegradable and more environmentally friendly. 
 Catering Equipment - Catering equipment products are designed to provide a complete commercial catering solution whether indoor or outdoor. Products include chafing dish frames and lids, wind guards and buffet sets. 
 Butane - Sterno produces a full line of professional quality portable butane stoves, ideal for action stations, made-to-order omelet lines, tableside and off-site cooking, outdoor events and more. Products also include select butane accessories for special culinary applications such as the culinary torch. Sterno butane fuel comes with an additional safety feature called Countersink Release Vent (CRV) Technology. 
 Table Lighting - Sterno sells a variety of items designed to enhance lighting and ambiance at meal settings which are critical to a customer s experience. Products include liquid wax, traditional hard wax and flameless electronic candles, as well as votive lamps, shaded lamps and accent lamps. 
 Flameless Candles and Outdoor Lighting - Sterno offers a wide selection of lighting for your home, garden, patio and yard with over 1000 SKU's available in its retail markets. All of Sterno's products are powered by one of the following - 1) Solar - solar panel with rechargeable power source - usually a rechargeable battery; 2) Battery - battery operated; 3) Plug-in - plugs directly into a regular wall socket either with 2 or 3 prong plug and with or 
 67 

without included and attached transformer; 4) Low Voltage - part of a set which includes a stand-alone transformer. Fixtures connect through a stand-alone wire via clip connectors; 5) Line Voltage - hardwired into a home's electrical circuitry, or 6) Rechargeable - product is recharged when empty usually through a plug in wire and an onboard rechargeable power source. 
 Flameless Candles - The flameless candle product line is made up of various types and sizes of candles with all of them sharing the one main attribute: their glow is powered by an artificial power source, most often battery. This makes them inherently safer than traditional candles as there is no flame or even heat generated to cause any type of accidents. Although pillar type candles are the most common shape, Sterno also designs and manufactures votives, tealights, tapers as well as specialty molded candles. Sterno candles stand out from the competition as they are the only manufacturer that offers the patented black wick. Sterno also developed its unique algorithm-based light circuit which gives the candle a naturally random flicker and glow. 
 Landscape Lighting - Landscape lighting is lighting that promotes and accentuates elements of a consumer s home, yard or garden so its beauty can be enjoyed both in daytime and nighttime. Another benefit of landscape lighting is added safety as it is easier to navigate around a home at night when it is reasonably well-lit. Landscape lighting was originally most commonly powered through a low voltage setup but as solar technologies have rapidly developed, many of these fixtures can achieve their lighting purposes with only a solar panel for power generation. Consumers with higher and more consistent lighting requirements most often opt for low voltage kits using wire and transformers to light their fixtures. Solar powered fixtures are advantageous for those consumers looking for cheaper and quicker to set up lighting solutions even if it often means less lumens and light. Another notable technology has been the development of LED lighting. LED s more efficient power generation technology has allowed for advantageous fixture designs and a higher level of power generation which were not easy or as cost effective to achieve as with legacy lighting technologies such as incandescent or halogen. LEDs also last longer and are generally more robust than older technologies. 
 D cor Lighting - D cor lighting has similar functions to landscape lighting but is usually less about safety and functionality and more about accenting an area of the outside home with ornamentation of some sort. With a d cor piece, the light the piece gives off and the item itself together become elements of beauty in the setting. Because these items are very trend driven, consumers are more apt to switch them out more often therefore increasing repeat purchase potential and other recurrent sales opportunities for Sterno. Some of the most common categories of d cor lighting are lanterns and baskets and string lighting. 
 Wickless Candle and Fragrance Products 
 Wax Warmers and Scented Wax Cubes - The wax and wax warmer line is composed of a large variety of fragrance and warmer design choices for consumers. The wax cubes are long-lasting and consistently release strong fragrance. The consumer likes the product because the scented wax cubes are an impulse item 2~ price range) and this product makes it easy and quick for the customer to change fragrance. The flameless feature is a plus in that it is very safe. The proprietary formula and world-class fragrances add to the high quality of the domestically-made products. Ongoing research ensures consumer loyalty, superior quality, and well-rounded fragrance programs. The wax warmers are made up of quality materials including wood, metal, ceramic, and glass. 
 Essential Oils and Diffusers - The 100 Pure Essential Oil lines and brands consists of Peppermint, Lavender, Lemon, Eucalyptus, Sweet Orange, Grapefruit, Tea tree, Cinnamon, etc. Customers are attracted to high quality, 100 percent pure oil products with no additives or fillers. Attractively designed diffusers appeal to consumers in the Aromatherapy Home Fragrance section. 
 ScentCharms - ScentCharms is Rimports newest product category. With various interchangeable high-quality fragrance oils and plug-in designs, consumers enjoy a personalized experience. The product is designed to be no spill, no mess, clutter-free, and long-lasting. 
 Aromatherapy Products - The aromatherapy line consists of room sprays, liquid hand soaps, foaming hand soaps, hand sanitizers, body lotions, and body scrubs, etc. The five unique fragrance combinations - lavender and chamomile, eucalyptus and rosemary, orange and vanilla, lemon and grapefruit, and peppermint and geranium - are made with 100 percent pure essential oils.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Our business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties. The following discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction with the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. In addition to the factors affecting our specific operating segments identified in connection with the descriptions of these segments and the financial results of the operations of these operating segments elsewhere in this report, the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following: 
 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Structure 
 Our future success is dependent on the employees of our Manager and the management teams of our businesses, the loss of any of whom could materially adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 Our future success depends, to a significant extent, on the continued services of the employees of our Manager, most of whom have worked together for a number of years. Our Manager does not have an employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer and, in any event, employment agreements may not prevent our Manager s employees from leaving or from competing with us in the future. 
 The future success of our businesses also depends on their respective management teams because we operate our businesses on a stand-alone basis, primarily relying on existing management teams for management of their day-to-day operations. Consequently, their operational success, as well as the success of our internal growth strategy, will be dependent on the continued efforts of the management teams of the businesses. The loss of services of one or more members of our management team or the management team at one of our businesses could materially adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 We face risks with respect to the evaluation and management of future platform or add-on acquisitions. 
 A component of our strategy is to continue to acquire additional platform subsidiaries, as well as add-on businesses for our existing businesses. Generally, because such acquisition targets are held privately, we may experience difficulty in evaluating potential target businesses as the information concerning these businesses is not publicly available. In addition, we and our subsidiary companies may have difficulty effectively managing or integrating acquisitions. We may experience greater than expected costs or difficulties relating to such acquisition, in which case, we might not achieve the anticipated returns from any particular acquisition, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 We may not be able to successfully fund future acquisitions of new businesses due to the lack of availability of debt or equity financing at the Company level on acceptable terms, which could impede the implementation of our acquisition strategy and materially adversely impact our financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 In order to make future acquisitions, we intend to raise capital primarily through debt financing at the Company level, additional equity offerings, the sale of stock or assets of our businesses, and by offering equity in the Trust or our businesses to the sellers of target businesses or by undertaking a combination of any of the above. Since the timing and size of acquisitions cannot be readily predicted, we may need to be able to obtain funding on short notice to benefit fully from attractive acquisition opportunities. Such funding may not be available on acceptable terms. In addition, the level of our indebtedness may impact our ability to borrow at the Company level. Another source of capital for us may be the sale of additional shares, subject to market conditions and investor demand for the shares at prices that we consider to be in the interests of our shareholders. These risks may materially adversely affect our ability to pursue our acquisition strategy successfully and materially adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 Under the Trust Agreement, the Company s board of directors will have the power to cause the Trust to be converted to a corporation in the future at its sole discretion in ways with which you may disagree. 
 The Trust Agreement authorizes the Company, acting through the its board of directors and without further shareholder approval, to cause the Trust to be converted to a corporation (the Conversion ). As a shareholder of the Trust, you may disagree with the terms of the Conversion that might be implemented by the Company s board of directors in the future, and you may disagree with the board s determination that the terms of the Conversion are not materially adverse to you as a shareholder or that they are in the best interests of the Trust and its shareholders. Your recourse, if you disagree, will be limited because our Trust Agreement gives broad authority and discretion to 
 72 

the Company s board of directors to implement the Conversion as long as the board determines that it will be in the best interests of the Trust and its shareholders to do so. 
 The Company s board of directors has full authority and discretion over the distributions of the Company, other than the profit allocation, and it may decide to reduce or eliminate distributions at any time, which may materially adversely affect the market price for our shares. 
 The Company s board of directors has full authority and discretion to determine whether or not a distribution by the Company should be declared and paid to the Trust and in turn, subject to U.S. federal income taxes and applicable state and local taxes, to our shareholders, as well as the amount and timing of any distribution. In addition, the management fee and profit allocation will be payment obligations of the Company and, as a result, will be paid, along with other Company obligations, prior to the payment of distributions to our shareholders. The Company s board of directors may, based on their review of our financial condition and results of operations and pending acquisitions or our tax structure, determine to reduce or eliminate distributions, which may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our shares. 
 We rely entirely on receipts from our businesses to make distributions to our shareholders. 
 The Trust s sole asset is its interest in the LLC, which holds controlling interests in our businesses. Therefore, we are dependent upon the ability of our businesses to generate earnings and cash flow and distribute them to us in the form of interest and principal payments on indebtedness and, from time to time, dividends on equity to enable us, first, to satisfy our financial and tax obligations and second to make distributions to our shareholders. This ability may be subject to limitations under laws of the jurisdictions in which they are incorporated or organized. If, as a consequence of these various restrictions, we are unable to generate sufficient receipts from our businesses, we may not be able to declare, or may have to delay or cancel payment of, distributions to our shareholders. 
 We do not own 100 of our businesses. While we receive cash payments from our businesses which are in the form of interest payments, debt repayment and dividends, if any dividends were to be paid by our businesses, they would be shared pro rata with the minority shareholders of our businesses and the amounts of dividends made to minority shareholders would not be available to us for any purpose, including Company debt service or distributions to our shareholders. Any proceeds from the sale of a business will be allocated among us and the non-controlling shareholders of the business that is sold. 
 The Company s board of directors has the power to change the terms of our shares in its sole discretion in ways with which you may disagree. 
 As an owner of our shares, you may disagree with changes made to the terms of our shares, and you may disagree with the Company s board of directors decision that the changes made to the terms of the shares are not materially adverse to you as a shareholder or that they do not alter the characterization of the Trust. Your recourse, if you disagree, will be limited because our Trust Agreement gives broad authority and discretion to our board of directors. In addition, we may change the nature of the shares to be issued to raise additional equity and remain a fixed-investment trust for tax purposes. 
 Certain provisions of the LLC Agreement of the Company and the Trust Agreement make it difficult for third parties to acquire control of the Trust and the LLC and could deprive you of the opportunity to obtain a takeover premium for your shares. 
 The LLC Agreement of the LLC and the Trust Agreement of the Trust contain a number of provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or may discourage a third party from acquiring, control of the Trust and the Company. These provisions include, among others: 
 restrictions on the LLC s ability to enter into certain transactions with our major shareholders, with the exception of our Manager, modeled on the limitation contained in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL; 
 allowing only the LLC s board of directors to fill newly created directorships, for those directors who are elected by our shareholders, and allowing only our Manager, as holder of a portion of the Allocation Interests, to fill vacancies with respect to the class of directors appointed by our Manager; 
 requiring that directors elected by our shareholders be removed, with or without cause, only by a vote of 85 of our shareholders; 
 requiring advance notice for nominations of candidates for election to the Company s board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by our shareholders at a shareholders meeting; 
 73 

having a substantial number of additional authorized but unissued shares that may be issued without shareholder action; 
 providing the Company s board of directors with certain authority to amend the LLC Agreement and the Trust Agreement, subject to certain voting and consent rights of the holders of trust interests and Allocation Interests; and 
 limitations regarding calling special meetings and written consents of our shareholders. 
 These provisions, as well as other provisions in the LLC Agreement and Trust Agreement may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise result in you obtaining a takeover premium for your shares. 
 We may have conflicts of interest with the noncontrolling shareholders of our businesses. 
 The boards of directors of our respective businesses have fiduciary duties to all their shareholders, including the Company and noncontrolling shareholders. As a result, they may make decisions that are in the best interests of their shareholders generally, but which are not necessarily in the best interest of the Company or our shareholders. In dealings with the Company, the directors of our businesses may have conflicts of interest and decisions may have to be made without the participation of directors appointed by the Company, and such decisions may be different from those that we would make. 
 Our financing arrangements expose us to additional risks associated with leverage and inhibits our operating flexibility and reduces earnings and cash available for distributions to our shareholders. 
 At December 31, 2022, we had approximately 1,850 million of consolidated debt outstanding. This level of consolidated debt could have important consequences, such as (i) limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our potential growth; (ii) increasing the cost of future borrowings; (iii) limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in our other areas of our business because of cash requirements to service our debt; and (iv) increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions. Our financing arrangements subject the Company to certain customary affirmative and restrictive covenants. If we violate any of these covenants, our lender may accelerate the maturity of any debt outstanding under our 2022 Credit Facility. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations may be affected by events beyond our control and will depend primarily upon cash produced by our businesses. Any failure to comply with the terms of our indebtedness could materially adversely affect us. 
 Changes in interest rates could materially adversely affect us. 
 Our 2022 Credit Facility bears interest at floating rates which will generally change as interest rates change. We bear the risk that the rates we are charged by our lender will increase faster than the earnings and cash flow of our businesses, which could reduce profitability, adversely affect our ability to service our debt, cause us to breach covenants contained in our 2022 Credit Facility and reduce earnings and cash available for distribution, any of which could materially adversely affect us. 
 We may engage in a business transaction with one or more target businesses that have relationships with our officers, our directors, or our Manager, which may create potential conflicts of interest. 
 We may decide to acquire one or more businesses with which our officers, our directors, or our Manager have a relationship. Potential conflicts of interest may exist with respect to a particular acquisition, and, as a result, the terms of the acquisition of a target business may not be as advantageous to our shareholders as it would have been absent any conflicts of interest. 
 CGI Maygar Holdings LLC may exercise significant influence over the Company. 
 As of December 31, 2022, CGI Maygar Holdings LLC owns approximately 7.9 million or approximatel y 11.0 of our common shares and may have significant influence over the election of directors in the future. 
 If, in the future, we cease to control and operate our businesses, we may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 
 Under the terms of the LLC Agreement, we have the latitude to make investments in businesses that we will not operate or control. If we make significant investments in businesses that we do not operate or control or cease to operate and control our businesses, we may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. If we were deemed to be an investment company, we would either have to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, obtain exemptive relief from the SEC or modify our investments or organizational structure or our contract rights to fall 
 74 

outside the definition of an investment company. Registering as an investment company could, among other things, materially adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations, materially limit our ability to borrow funds or engage in other transactions involving leverage and require us to add directors who are independent of us or our Manager and otherwise will subject us to additional regulation that will be costly and time-consuming. 
 Certain of our businesses are dependent on a limited number of customers to derive a large portion of their revenue, and the loss of one of these customers may adversely affect the financial condition, business and results of operations of these businesses. 
 Our Ergobaby, Marucci, Velocity, Altor and Sterno businesses derive a significant amount of revenue from a concentrated number of retailers, distributors or manufacturers. Any negative change involving these retailers, distributors or manufacturers, including industry consolidation, store closings, reduction in purchasing levels or bankruptcies, could negatively impact the sales of these businesses and may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of these businesses. 
 Our businesses do not have and may not have long-term contracts with their customers and clients and the loss of customers and clients could materially adversely affect their financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 Our businesses are and may be, based primarily upon individual orders and sales with their customers and clients. Our businesses historically have not entered into long-term supply contracts with their customers and clients. As such, their customers and clients could cease using their services or buying their products from them at any time and for any reason. The fact that they do not enter into long-term contracts with their customers and clients means that they have no recourse in the event a customer or client no longer wants to use their services or purchase products from them. If a significant number of their customers or clients elect not to use their services or purchase their products, it could materially adversely affect their financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 Our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the future by the global COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted global commercial activity and contributed to significant volatility in the equity and debt markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and restrictive measures taken during the course of the pandemic to contain or mitigate its spread caused business shutdowns, or the re-introduction of business shutdowns, cancellations of events and restrictions on travel, significant reductions in demand for certain goods and services, reductions in business activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions, labor shortages, increased inflationary pressure and overall economic and financial market instability both globally and in the United States. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions impact our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, difficult to predict and largely outside of our control, including, but not limited to, the occurrence, spread, duration and severity of any subsequent wave or waves of outbreaks, including the emergence and spread of variants of the COVID-19 virus; the impact on our customers and suppliers; the actions taken by the U.S. and foreign governments to contain the pandemic, address its impact or respond to the reduction in global and local economic activity; the occurrence, duration and severity of a global, regional or national recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event; and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Risks Related to Taxation 
 The Trust is subject to U.S. corporate income taxes which reduces the earnings and cash available for distributions to holders of Trust common shares in respect of such investments and could adversely affect the value of Trust common shareholders investment. 
 Effective September 1, 2021, the Trust elected to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (the Election ). The Trust now incurs entity level U.S. federal corporate income taxes and applicable state and local taxes that it would not otherwise incur if it were still treated as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes. In addition, before the tax reclassification, income from the Trust was passed through to holders of its preferred shares, which resulted in less income being passed through from the Trust to holders of its common shares and effectively reduced each common shareholder s allocable share of the Trust s income; however, after the tax reclassification, no income will pass through to any shareholders, but the Trust will not be able to claim a tax deduction for 
 75 

distributions in respect of the preferred shares. Therefore, the amount of cash available for distributions to holders of Trust common shares could be reduced and their investment could be adversely affected. 
 Following the tax reclassification, determinations, declarations, and payments of distributions to holders of Trust common shares will continue to be at the sole discretion of the Company s board of directors. Historically, our distribution policy has been to make regular distributions on outstanding common shares, and we expect to continue this policy of regular distributions. However, because the Trust will incur entity level income taxes following the tax reclassification, we reduced our previous annual distribution from 1.44 per Trust common share per year to approximately 1.00 per common share per year. Our distribution policy may be changed at any time at the discretion of the Company s board of directors. 
 Future changes to tax laws are uncertain and may result in the Trust paying corporate income tax at rates higher than expected or result in the Trust failing to realize the anticipated benefits of the Election. 
 Recent proposals for tax reform include proposals to raise corporate income tax rates and capital gains tax rates. Future changes to tax laws are uncertain, but any such changes could cause the Trust to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Election. If corporate income tax rates are raised, the anticipated advantages of being treated as a corporation for U.S. tax purposes would be diminished. In addition, any general changes to tax laws, such as changes to limitations on the deductibility of interest, could result in the Trust or its shareholders paying tax at rates higher than anticipated. 
 
 Risks Related to the Preferred Shares 
 Distributions on the Series A Preferred Shares are discretionary and non-cumulative. 
 Distributions on the Series A Preferred Shares are discretionary and non-cumulative. Holders of the Series A Preferred Shares will only receive distributions of the Series A Preferred Shares when, as and if declared by the board of directors of the Company. Consequently, if the board of directors of the Company does not authorize and declare a distribution for a distribution period, holders of the Series A Preferred Shares would not be entitled to receive any distribution for such distribution period, and such unpaid distribution will not be payable in such distribution period or in later distribution periods. We will have no obligation to pay distributions for a distribution period if the board of directors of the Company does not declare such distribution before the scheduled record date for such period, whether or not distributions are declared or paid for any subsequent distribution period with respect to the Series A Preferred Shares, or any other preferred shares we may issue or our common shares. This may result in holders of the Series A Preferred Shares not receiving the full amount of distributions that they expect to receive, or any distributions, and may make it more difficult to resell Series A Preferred Shares or to do so at a price that the holder finds attractive. 
 The board of directors of the Company may, in its sole discretion, determine to suspend distributions on the Series A Preferred Shares, which may have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Series A Preferred Shares. There can be no assurances that our operations will generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to pay distributions on the Series A Preferred Shares. Our financial and operating performance is subject to prevailing economic and industry conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. 
 The Series A, Series B and Series C Preferred Shares are equity securities and are subordinated to our existing and future indebtedness. 
 The Series A, Series B and Series C Preferred Shares are our equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness. This means that the Series A, Series B and Series C Preferred Shares rank junior to all of our indebtedness and to other non-equity claims on us and our assets available to satisfy claims on us, including claims in our liquidation. In addition, the rights allocated to the Company s allocation interests may reduce the amount available for distribution by the Trust upon its liquidation, dissolution or winding up. Further, the Series A, Series B and Series C Preferred Shares place no restrictions on our business or operations or on our ability to incur indebtedness or engage in any transactions, subject only to the limited voting rights. 
 
 Risks Relating to Our Manager 
 Our Chief Executive Officer, directors, Manager and management team may allocate some of their time to other businesses, thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs, which may materially adversely affect our operations. 
 76 

Only our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Ryan Faulkingham, devotes substantially all of his time to our affairs. Our Chief Executive Officer, directors, Manager and members of our management team may engage in other business activities. This may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and our management and operations of other businesses. Conflicts of interest that arise over the allocation of time may not always be resolved in our favor and may materially adversely affect our operations. See Part III, Item 13. " Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence " for the potential conflicts of interest of which you should be aware. 
 Our Manager and its affiliates, including members of our management team, may engage in activities that compete with us or our businesses. 
 Neither our management team nor our Manager is expressly prohibited from investing in or managing other entities, including those that are in the same or similar line of business as our businesses. In this regard, the Management Services Agreement and the obligation to provide management services will not create a mutually exclusive relationship between our Manager and its affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other. 
 Our Manager need not present an acquisition or disposition opportunity to us if our Manager determines on its own that such acquisition or disposition opportunity does not meet the Company s acquisition or disposition criteria. 
 Our Manager will review any acquisition or disposition opportunity presented to the Manager to determine if it satisfies the Company s acquisition or disposition criteria, as established by the Company s board of directors from time to time. If our Manager determines, in its sole discretion, that an opportunity fits our criteria, our Manager will refer the opportunity to the Company s board of directors for its authorization and approval prior to the consummation thereof; opportunities that our Manager determines do not fit our criteria do not need to be presented to the Company s board of directors for consideration. If such an opportunity is ultimately profitable, we will have not participated in such opportunity. Upon a determination by the Company s board of directors not to promptly pursue an opportunity presented to it by our Manager in whole or in part, our Manager will be unrestricted in its ability to pursue such opportunity, or any part that we do not promptly pursue, on its own or refer such opportunity to other entities, including its affiliates. 
 We cannot remove our Manager solely for poor performance, which could limit our ability to improve our performance and could materially adversely affect the market price of our shares. 
 Under the terms of the Management Services Agreement, our Manager cannot be removed as a result of under-performance. Instead, the Company s board of directors can only remove our Manager in certain limited circumstances or upon a vote by the majority of the Company s board of directors and the majority of our shareholders to terminate the Management Services Agreement. This limitation could materially adversely affect the market price of our shares. 
 Our Manager can resign on 180 days notice and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement within that time, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations as well as the market price of our shares. 
 Our Manager has the right, under the management services agreement, to resign at any time on 180 days written notice, whether we have found a replacement or not. If our Manager resigns, we may not be able to contract with a new manager or hire internal management with similar expertise and ability to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms within 90 days, or at all, in which case our operations are likely to experience a disruption, our financial condition, business and results of operations as well as our ability to pay distributions are likely to be adversely affected and the market price of our shares may decline. In addition, the coordination of our internal management, acquisition activities and supervision of our businesses is likely to suffer if we are unable to identify and reach an agreement with a single institution or group of executives having the expertise possessed by our Manager and its affiliates. Even if we are able to retain comparable management, whether internal or external, the integration of such management and their lack of familiarity with our businesses may result in additional costs and time delays that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 We must pay our Manager the management fee regardless of our performance. 
 Our Manager is entitled to receive a management fee that is based on our adjusted consolidated net assets, as defined in the management services agreement, regardless of the performance of our businesses. The calculation of the management fee is unrelated to the Company s net income. As a result, the management fee may incentivize 
 77 

our Manager to increase the amount of our assets. For example, the acquisition of additional assets or the incurrence of third party debt could be prioritized rather than increasing the performance of our businesses. 
 We cannot determine the amount of the management fee that will be paid over time with any certainty. 
 The management fee paid to CGM for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 63.6 million. The management fee is calculated by reference to the Company s adjusted net assets, which will be impacted by the acquisition or disposition of businesses, which can be significantly influenced by our Manager, as well as the performance of our businesses and other businesses we may acquire in the future. Changes in adjusted net assets and in the resulting management fee could be significant, resulting in a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations. In addition, if the performance of the Company declines, assuming adjusted net assets remains the same, management fees will increase as a percentage of the Company s net income. 
 We cannot determine the amount of profit allocation that will be paid over time with any certainty. 
 We cannot determine the amount of profit allocation that will be paid over time with any certainty. Such determination would be dependent on the potential sale proceeds received for any of our businesses and the performance of the Company and its businesses over a multi-year period of time, among other factors that cannot be predicted with certainty at this time. Such factors may have a significant impact on the amount of any profit allocation to be paid. Likewise, such determination would be dependent on whether certain hurdles were surpassed giving rise to a payment of profit allocation. Any amounts paid in respect of the profit allocation are unrelated to the management fee earned for performance of services under the management services agreement. 
 The fees to be paid to our Manager pursuant to the Management Services Agreement, the offsetting Management Services Agreements and integration services agreements and the profit allocation to be paid to certain persons who are employees and partners of our Manager, as holders of the Allocation Interests, pursuant to the LLC Agreement may significantly reduce the amount of earnings and cash available for distribution to our shareholders. 
 Under the Management Services Agreement, the Company will be obligated to pay a management fee to and, subject to certain conditions, reimburse the costs and out-of-pocket expenses of our Manager incurred on behalf of the Company in connection with the provision of services to the Company. Similarly, our businesses will be obligated to pay fees to and reimburse the costs and expenses of our Manager pursuant to any offsetting Management Services Agreements entered into between our Manager and one of our businesses, or any integration services agreements to which such businesses are a party. In addition, Sostratus LLC, as holder of the Allocation Interests, will be entitled to receive profit allocations. While it is difficult to quantify with any certainty the actual amount of any such payments in the future, we do expect that such amounts could be substantial. See the section entitled Part 3, Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence for more information about these payment obligations of the Company. The management fee and profit allocation will be payment obligations of the Company and, as a result, will be paid, along with other Company obligations, prior to the payment of distributions to shareholders. As a result, the payment of these amounts may significantly reduce the amount of earnings and cash available for distribution to our shareholders. 
 Our Manager s influence on conducting our operations, including on our conducting of transactions, gives it the ability to increase its fees, which may reduce the amount of earnings and cash available for distribution to our shareholders. 
 Under the terms of the Management Services Agreement, our Manager is paid a management fee calculated as a percentage of the Company s adjusted net assets for certain items and is unrelated to net income or any other performance base or measure. Our Manager controls and may advise us to consummate transactions, incur third party debt or conduct our operations in a manner that, in our Manager s reasonable discretion, are necessary to the future growth of our businesses and are in the best interests of our shareholders. These transactions, however, may increase the amount of fees paid to our Manager. Our Manager s ability to increase its fees, through the influence it has over our operations, may increase the compensation paid by our Manager. Our Manager s ability to influence the management fee paid to it by us could reduce the amount of earnings and cash available for distribution to our shareholders. 
 Fees paid by the Company and our businesses pursuant to integration services agreements do not offset fees payable under the Management Services Agreement and will be in addition to the management fee payable by the Company under the Management Services Agreement. 
 78 

The Management Services Agreement provides that our businesses may enter into integration services agreements with our Manager pursuant to which our businesses will pay fees to our Manager for services provided by our Manager relating to the integration of a business s financial reporting, computer systems and decision making and management processes into our operations following an acquisition of such business. See Part III, Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence for more information about these agreements. Unlike fees paid under the offsetting Management Services Agreements, fees that are paid pursuant to such integration services agreements will not reduce the management fee payable by the Company. Therefore, such fees will be in excess of the management fee payable by the Company. 
 The fees to be paid to our Manager pursuant to these integration service agreements will be paid prior to any principal, interest or dividend payments to be paid to the Company by our businesses, which will reduce the amount of earnings and cash available for distributions to shareholders. 
 Our profit allocation may induce our Manager to make suboptimal decisions regarding our operations. 
 Sostratus LLC, as holder of our Allocation Interests, will receive a profit allocation based on ongoing cash flows and capital gains in excess of a hurdle rate. Certain persons who are employees and partners of our Manager are owners of Sostratus LLC. In this respect, a calculation and payment of profit allocation may be triggered upon the sale of one of our businesses. As a result, our Manager may be incentivized to recommend the sale of one or more of our businesses to the Company s board of directors at a time that may not be optimal for our shareholders. 
 The obligations to pay the management fee and profit allocation may cause the Company to liquidate assets or incur debt. 
 If we do not have sufficient liquid assets to pay the management fee and profit allocation when such payments are due, we may be required to liquidate assets or incur debt in order to make such payments. This circumstance could materially adversely affect our liquidity and ability to make distributions to our shareholders. 
 
 Risks Specific to Our Subsidiaries 
 
 Risks Related to Arnold 
 Arnold's operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose it to the risk of material environmental liabilities, which could have a negative effect on its financial condition or results of operations. 
 Arnold may be subject to potential liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures, mainly because of past operations and the operations of predecessor companies. Arnold continues to incur remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination, for which we may not be fully indemnified, and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous materials. Arnold also may become party to various legal proceedings relating to alleged impacts from pollutants released into the environment. Various federal, state, local and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require Arnold to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on its financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Risks Related to Sterno 
 Sterno's products operate at high temperatures and use flammable fuels, each of which could subject our business to product liability claims. 
 Sterno products expose it to potential product liability claims typical of fuel based heating products. The fuels Sterno uses in its products are flammable and may be toxic if ingested. Although Sterno products have comprehensive labeling and it follows government and third party based standards and protocols, it cannot guarantee there will not be accidents due to misuse or otherwise. Accidents involving Sterno products may have an adverse effect on its reputation and reduce demand for its products. In addition, Sterno may be held responsible for 
 79 

damages beyond its insurance coverage and there can be no guarantee that it will be able to procure adequate insurance coverage in the future. 
 
 Risks Related to Velocity Outdoor 
 Velocity s products are subject to product safety and liability lawsuits, which could materially adversely affect its financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 As a manufacturer of recreational airguns and archery products, Velocity is involved in various litigation matters that occur in the ordinary course of business. Although Velocity provides information regarding safety procedures and warnings with all of its product packaging, not all users of its products will observe all proper safety practices. Failure to observe proper safety practices may result in injuries that give rise to product liability and personal injury claims and lawsuits, as well as claims for breach of contract, loss of profits and consequential damages. 
 If any unresolved lawsuits or claims are determined adversely, they could have a material adverse effect on Velocity, its financial condition, business and results of operations. As more of Velocity s products are sold to and used by its consumers, the likelihood of product liability claims being made against it increases. In addition, the running of statutes of limitations in the United States for personal injuries to minor children may be suspended during the child s legal minority. Therefore, it is possible that accidents resulting in injuries to minors may not give rise to lawsuits until a number of years later. 
 There is a risk that Velocity's product liability insurance may not be sufficient to cover all liabilities incurred in connection with such claims and the financial consequences of these claims and lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. 
 
 General Risk Factors 
 We could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity attacks. 
 We, and our businesses, use a variety of information technology systems in the ordinary course of business, which are potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses and cybersecurity attacks, including cybersecurity attacks to our information technology infrastructure and attempts by others to gain access to our proprietary or sensitive information, and ranging from individual attempts to advanced persistent threats. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions, including by computer hackers, nation-state affiliated actors, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. The procedures and controls we use to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure may not be sufficient to prevent cybersecurity incidents. The results of these incidents could include misstated financial data, theft of trade secrets or other intellectual property, liability for disclosure of confidential customer, supplier or employee information, increased costs arising from the implementation of additional security protective measures, litigation and reputational damage, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations. Any remedial costs or other liabilities related to cybersecurity incidents may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. 
 In addition, cybersecurity has become a top priority for global lawmakers and regulators, and some jurisdictions have proposed or enacted laws requiring companies to notify regulators and individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data. If we fail to comply with the relevant and increasing complex laws and regulations, we could suffer financial losses, a disruption of our business, liability to investors, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. 
 Impairment of our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets could result in significant charges that would adversely impact our future operating results. 
 A significant portion of our long-term assets are comprised of intangible assets, including goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets recorded as a result of past acquisitions. We assess the potential impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If our analysis indicates that an individual asset s carrying value exceeds its fair market value, we will record a loss equal to the excess of the individual asset s carrying value over its fair value. The impairment testing steps require significant amounts of judgment and subjectivity. 
 Factors that could trigger impairment include the following: 
 significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results; 
 significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; 
 80 

significant negative industry or economic trends; 
 significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; 
 changes in our organization or management reporting structure could result in additional reporting units, which may require alternative methods of estimating fair values or greater desegregation or aggregation in our analysis by reporting unit; and 
 a decline in our market capitalization below net book value. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had identified indefinite lived intangible assets with a carrying value in our financial statements of 57.0 million, and goodwill of 1,133.4 million. 
 Our businesses are subject to unplanned business interruptions which may adversely affect our performance. 
 Operational interruptions and unplanned events at one or more of our production facilities, such as explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, accidents, transportation interruptions and supply could cause substantial losses in our production capacity. Furthermore, because customers may be dependent on planned deliveries from us, customers that have to reschedule their own operations due to our delivery delays may be able to pursue financial claims against us, and we may incur costs to correct such problems in addition to any liability resulting from such claims. Such interruptions may also harm our reputation among actual and potential customers, potentially resulting in a loss of business. To the extent these losses are not covered by insurance, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by such events. 
 Our businesses could experience fluctuations in the costs and availability of raw materials, components or whole goods which could result in significant disruptions to supply chains, production disruptions and increased costs for our businesses. 
 Our businesses require access to various raw materials, components and whole goods to manufacture and distribute products. Changes in the availability and price of raw materials, components and whole goods, which can fluctuate significantly as a result of economic volatility, regulatory instability or change in import tariffs or trade agreements, can significantly increase the costs of production and distribution, which could have a material negative effect on the profitability of the businesses. 
 We could be adversely affected if we experience shortages of components from our suppliers or if disruptions in the supply chain lead to parts shortages for our customers. 
 A portion of our annual cost of sales is driven by the purchase of goods. We select our suppliers based on total value (including price, delivery and quality), taking into consideration their production capacities and financial condition, and we expect that they will be able to support our needs. However, there is no assurance that adverse financial conditions, including bankruptcies of our suppliers, reduced levels of production, natural disasters, staffing shortages, supply chain issues or other problems experienced by our suppliers will not result in shortages or delays in their supply of components to us. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in labor shortages and supply chain disruptions. Any significant production disruption could have a material impact on our operations, operating results and financial condition. If we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from our suppliers, we may be unable to meet our production schedules for some of our key products and to ship such products to our customers in a timely fashion, which would adversely affect our sales, profitability and customer relations. 
 Our businesses rely and may rely on their intellectual property and licenses to use others intellectual property, for competitive advantage. If our businesses are unable to protect their intellectual property, are unable to obtain or retain licenses to use other s intellectual property, or if they infringe upon or are alleged to have infringed upon others intellectual property, it could have a material adverse effect on their financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 Each business's success depends in part on their, or licenses to use others , brand names, proprietary technology and manufacturing techniques. These businesses rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect their intellectual property rights. The steps they have taken to protect their intellectual property rights may not prevent third parties from using their intellectual property and other proprietary information without their authorization or independently developing intellectual property and other proprietary information that is similar. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our businesses intellectual property rights effectively or to the same extent as the laws of the United States. 
 81 

Stopping unauthorized use of their proprietary information and intellectual property, and defending claims that they have made unauthorized use of others proprietary information or intellectual property, may be difficult, time-consuming and costly. The use of their intellectual property and other proprietary information by others, and the use by others of their intellectual property and proprietary information, could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage they have developed, cause them to lose sales or otherwise harm their business. 
 Our businesses may become involved in legal proceedings and claims in the future either to protect their intellectual property or to defend allegations that they have infringed upon others intellectual property rights. These claims and any resulting litigation could subject them to significant liability for damages and invalidate their property rights. In addition, these lawsuits, regardless of their merits, could be time consuming and expensive to resolve and could divert management s time and attention. The costs associated with any of these actions could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on their financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 Our businesses are and may be subject to federal, state and foreign environmental laws and regulations that expose them to potential financial liability. Complying with applicable environmental laws requires significant resources, and if our businesses fail to comply, they could be subject to substantial liability. 
 Some of the facilities and operations of our businesses are and may be subject to a variety of federal, state and foreign environmental laws and regulations including laws and regulations pertaining to the handling, storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes, which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws and regulations currently in place and in the future. Compliance with current and future environmental laws is a major consideration for our businesses as any material violations of these laws can lead to substantial liability, revocations of discharge permits, fines or penalties. Because some of our businesses use hazardous materials and generate hazardous wastes in their operations, they may be subject to potential financial liability for costs associated with the investigation and remediation of their own sites, or sites at which they have arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes, if such sites become contaminated. Even if they fully comply with applicable environmental laws and are not directly at fault for the contamination, our businesses may still be liable. Our businesses may also be held liable for damages caused by environmental and other conditions that existed prior to our acquisition the assets, business or operations involved, whether or not such damages are subject to indemnification from a prior owner. Costs associated with these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 Defects in the products provided by our companies could result in financial or other damages to their customers, which could result in reduced demand for our companies products and/or liability claims against our companies. 
 As manufacturers and distributors of consumer products, certain of our companies are subject to various laws, rules and regulations, which may empower governmental agencies and authorities to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous. Under certain circumstances, a governmental authority could require our companies to repurchase or recall one or more of their products. Additionally, laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some cities and states, as well as in other countries in which they sell their products, where more restrictive laws and regulations exist or may be adopted in the future. Any repurchase or recall of such products could be costly and could damage the reputation of our companies. If any of our companies were required to remove, or voluntarily remove, their products from the market, their reputation may be tarnished and they may have large quantities of finished products that they cannot sell. Additionally, our companies may be subject to regulatory actions that could harm their reputations, adversely impact the values of their brands and/or increase the cost of production. 
 Our companies also face exposure to product liability claims in the event that one of their products is alleged to have resulted in property damage, bodily injury or other adverse effects. Defects in products could result in customer dissatisfaction or a reduction in, or cancellation of, future purchases or liability claims against our companies. If these defects occur frequently, our reputation may be impaired permanently. Defects in products could also result in financial or other damages to customers, for which our companies may be asked or required to compensate their customers, in the form of substantial monetary judgments or otherwise. There can be no assurance that rapidly changing safety standards will not render unsaleable products that complied with previously-applicable safety standards. As a result, these types of claims could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. 
 82 

Our businesses are subject to certain risks associated with their foreign operations or business they conduct in foreign jurisdictions. 
 Some of our businesses have and may have operations or conduct business outside the United States. Certain risks are inherent in operating or conducting business in foreign jurisdictions, including exposure to local economic conditions; difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems; longer payment cycles for foreign customers; adverse currency exchange controls; exposure to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates; potential adverse changes in political environments; actual or threatened geopolitical conflict; withholding taxes and restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investments and earnings; export and import restrictions; difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights; and required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations. These risks individually and collectively have the potential to negatively impact our financial condition, business and results of operations. 
 The success of our branded consumer businesses depends on our ability to maintain the value and reputation of the brand. 
 The name of our branded consumer businesses is integral to those businesses. Maintaining, promoting, and positioning our branded consumer businesses will depend, in part, on the success of marketing and merchandising efforts and the ability to provide a consistent, high quality products and services. Our branded consumer businesses rely on social media, as one of their marketing strategies, to have a positive impact on both brand value and reputation. The brand and reputation of our branded consumer businesses could be adversely affected if those subsidiaries fail to achieve their objectives, if their public image was to be tarnished by negative publicity, which could be amplified by social media, or if they fail to deliver innovative and high quality products. The reputation of our branded consumer businesses could also be impacted by adverse publicity, whether or not valid, regarding allegations that we or our subsidiaries, or persons associated with us or our subsidiaries or formerly associated with us or our subsidiaries, have violated applicable laws or regulations, including but not limited to those related to safety, employment, discrimination, harassment, whistle-blowing, privacy, corporate citizenship or improper business practices. Additionally, while our branded consumer businesses devote effort and resources to protecting their intellectual property, if these efforts are not successful the value of those brands may be harmed. Any harm to the brand or reputation of our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 Arnold 
 Our Arnold subsidiary was named as co-defendant, together with 300 West LLC 300 West ), in a suit filed in the Twenty-Second Judicial Circuit, McHenry County, Illinois, Chancery Division (Case No. 13CH1046) in 2013 by the State of Illinois (the Marengo Litigation ). Arnold leases a site in Marengo, McHenry County, Illinois (the Site from 300 West. Since 2008, Arnold and 300 West have been a part of the Illinois Remediation Program with respect to the Site. In the Marengo Litigation, the State of Illinois claimed that 300 West and Arnold discharged Chlorinated VOCs into the groundwater on-Site, which has since migrated off-Site into private drinking wells. The State of Illinois sought injunctive relief and civil penalties. In June of 2016, the parties entered into a consent order (as amended and restated up and through the date hereof, the Consent Order ). 300 West, at its expense, connected residents whose drinking water was impacted by the alleged release to the City of Marengo s public water supply, as required by the Consent Order. The Consent Order also requires Arnold and 300 West to submit to the Illinois Environmental 
 86 

Protection Agency (IEPA) a comprehensive plan detailing steps to be taken by 300 West and Arnold to remediate on- and off-site soil and groundwater contamination. Discussions between Arnold and 300 West and the IEPA regarding the remediation plan are ongoing. The Consent Order also requires the ultimate settlement of any stipulated and civil penalties related to the Marengo Litigation. In May of 2021, the McHenry County State s Attorney joined the Marengo Litigation as a plaintiff. 
 Certain damages incurred by Arnold in connection with the Marengo Litigation are subject to indemnification pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, among SPS Technologies, LLC SPS ), SPS Technologies Limited SPS Ltd. ), Precision Castparts Corp. (collectively with SPS and SPS Ltd., the SPS Entities ), Arnold and Audax Private Equity Fund, L.P., dated December 20, 2004, and prior consents to indemnification given by the SPS Entities. Arnold has cooperated with the governmental agencies in the Marengo Litigation investigations and proceedings, as well as the obligations agreed to pursuant to the Consent Order. CODI does not believe that the outcome of the Marengo Litigation will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

Distributions 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we declared and paid cash distributions of 1.00 to our common shareholders. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we declared and paid cash distributions of 2.21 to holders of record of our common shares, including a special distribution to shareholders in August 2021. On August 3, 2021, in order to offset a portion of the tax liability to the shareholders as a result of the election to cause the Trust to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company's board of directors declared a special cash distribution on the Trust s common shares of 0.88 per common share. For the year 2020, we declared and paid cash distributions of 1.44 per share to holders of record of our common shares. Following the tax reclassification, the Company s board reduced our anticipated annual distribution from 1.44 per Trust common share per year to approximately 1.00 per common share per year. The common cash distributions should generally constitute qualified dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles), provided that the requisite holding period is met. To the extent that the amount of the cash distributions exceeds earnings and profits, such distribution will first be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the holder s adjusted tax basis in the shares, and thereafter be treated as capital gain from the sale or exchange of such shares. The Company expects cash distributions will exceed earnings and profits in the 2022 taxable year. 
 The Company plans to continue to declare and pay quarterly cash distributions on all outstanding shares through fiscal 2023, however, the Company s board of directors has full authority and discretion to determine whether or not a distribution by the Company should be declared and paid to the Trust and in turn to our shareholders, as well as the amount and timing of any distribution. The Company s board of directors may, based on their review of our financial condition and results of operations and any future changes to our tax structure, determine to modify future distributions.

 This Item 7 contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Our actual results, performance, prospects or opportunities could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. Additional risks of which we are not currently aware or which we currently deem immaterial could also cause our actual results to differ, including those discussed in the sections entitled Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
 Overview 
 Compass Diversified Holdings, a Delaware statutory trust, was incorporated in Delaware on November 18, 2005. Compass Group Diversified Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability Company, was also formed on November 18, 2005. In accordance with the Third Amended and Restated Trust Agreement, dated as of August 3, 2021 (as amended and restated, the "Trust Agreement"), the Trust is sole owner of 100 of the Trust Interests (as defined in the Company's Sixth Amended and Restated Operating Agreement, dated as of August 3, 2021 (as amended and restated, the "LLC Agreement") of the Company and, pursuant to the LLC Agreement, the Company has outstanding the identical number of Trust Interests as the number of outstanding shares of the Trust. Sostratus LLC owns all of our Allocation Interests. The Company is the operating entity with a board of directors and other corporate governance responsibilities, similar to that of a Delaware corporation. 
 The Trust and the Company were formed to acquire and manage a group of small and middle-market businesses headquartered in North America. We characterize small and middle market businesses as those that generate annual cash flows of up to 100 million. We focus on companies of this size because we believe that these companies are more able to achieve growth rates above those of their relevant industries and are also frequently more amenable to efforts to improve earnings and cash flow. 
 In pursuing new acquisitions, we seek businesses with the following characteristics: 
 North American base of operations; 
 stable and growing earnings and cash flow; 
 maintains a significant market share in defensible industry niche (i.e., has a reason to exist 
 solid and proven management team with meaningful incentives; 
 low technological and/or product obsolescence risk; and 
 a diversified customer and supplier base. 
 Our management team s strategy for our subsidiaries involves: 
 utilizing structured incentive compensation programs tailored to each business in order to attract, recruit and retain talented managers to operate our businesses; 
 regularly monitoring financial and operational performance, instilling consistent financial discipline, and supporting management in the development and implementation of information systems to effectively achieve these goals; 
 assisting management in their analysis and pursuit of prudent organic cash flow growth strategies (both revenue and cost related); 
 identifying and working with management to execute attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities; and 
 forming strong subsidiary level boards of directors, including independent directors, to supplement management in their development and implementation of strategic goals and objectives. 
 Based on the experience of our management team and its ability to identify and negotiate acquisitions, we believe we are well positioned to acquire additional attractive businesses. Our management team has a large network of deal intermediaries to whom it actively markets and who we expect to expose us to potential acquisitions. Through this network, as well as our management team s active proprietary transaction sourcing efforts, we typically have a substantial pipeline of potential acquisition targets. In consummating transactions, our management team has, in the past, been able to successfully navigate complex situations surrounding acquisitions, including corporate spin- 
 90 

offs, transitions of family-owned businesses, management buy-outs and reorganizations. We believe the flexibility, creativity, experience and expertise of our management team in structuring transactions provides us with a strategic advantage by allowing us to consider non-traditional and complex transactions tailored to fit a specific acquisition target. 
 In addition, because we intend to fund acquisitions through the utilization of our 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, we do not expect to be subject to delays in or conditions by closing acquisitions that would be typically associated with transaction specific financing, as is typically the case in such acquisitions. We believe this advantage is a powerful one and is highly unusual in the marketplace for acquisitions in which we operate. 
 Initial public offering and Company formation 
 On May 16, 2006, we completed our initial public offering of 13,500,000 shares of the Trust (the IPO ). Subsequent to the IPO the Company s board of directors engaged our Manager to externally manage the day-to-day operations and affairs of the Company, oversee the management and operations of the businesses and to perform those services customarily performed by executive officers of a public company. 
 From May 16, 2006 through December 31, 2022, we purchased twenty-three businesses (each of our businesses is treated as a separate operating segment) and disposed of eleven businesses. The tables below reflect summarized information relating to our acquisitions and dispositions from the date of our IPO through December 31, 2022 (in thousands):

 We made loans to and purchased a controlling interest in FOX on January 4, 2008, for approximately 80.4 million. In August 2013, FOX completed an initial public offering of its common stock. As a result of the initial public offering, our ownership interest in FOX was reduced to approximately 53.9 . No gain was reflected as a result of the sale of our FOX shares in the initial public offering because our majority classification of FOX did not change. FOX used a portion of their net proceeds received from the sale of their shares as well as proceeds from a new external FOX credit facility to repay 61.5 million in outstanding indebtedness to us under their existing credit facility with us. In July 2014, through a secondary offering, our ownership in FOX was lowered from approximately 54 to approximately 41 , and as a result we deconsolidated FOX as of July 10, 2014. In March and August 2016, through two more secondary offerings and a share repurchase by FOX, our ownership in the outstanding common stock of FOX was further lowered to approximately 23 as of September 30, 2016. In November 2016, through another secondary offering, our ownership in the outstanding common stock of FOX was further lowered to approximately 14 . On March 13, 2017, FOX closed on a secondary public offering of 5,108,718 shares of FOX common stock held by CODI, which represented CODI's remaining investment in FOX. We recognized total net proceeds from the sales of our FOX shares of approximately 465.1 million, plus proceeds from the repayment of the FOX credit facility of 61.5 million upon completion of their initial public offering, and a total gain of 428.7 million. 
 We are dependent on the earnings of, and cash receipts from, the businesses that we own in order to meet our corporate overhead and management fee expenses and to pay distributions. The earnings and cash receipts from

our businesses are generally lowest in the first quarter, and strongest in the third and fourth quarter, of each fiscal year. These earnings and cash receipts, net of any non-controlling interest in these businesses, are available to: 
 meet capital expenditure requirements, management fees and corporate overhead charges; 
 support working capital needs of our businesses and corporate overhead; and 
 be distributed by the Trust to shareholders. 
 2022 Highlights and Recent Events 
 Acquisition of PrimaLoft 
 On July 12, 2022, the LLC, through its newly formed indirect acquisition subsidiary, Relentless Intermediate, Inc. ("PrimaLoft Buyer"), acquired PrimaLoft Technologies Holdings, Inc. PrimaLoft pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement (the PrimaLoft Purchase Agreement ), dated June 4, 2022, by and between PrimaLoft Buyer and VP PrimaLoft Holdings, LLC ("PrimaLoft Seller"). The total purchase price, including proceeds from noncontrolling shareholders, was approximately 530 million, before working capital and other customary adjustments. The Company funded the acquisition through a draw on its revolving credit facility and a draw in full on its new 400 million term loan facility. 
 PrimaLoft, Inc. is a branded, advanced material technology company based in Latham, New York and is a leader in the research and innovative development of high-performance material solutions, specializing in insulations and fabrics. PrimaLoft insulation was originally developed for the U.S. Army as a water-resistant, synthetic alternative to down.

With its Relentlessly Responsible mission, PrimaLoft strives to balance innovation, performance and sustainability in the pursuit of a better future. 
 2022 Credit Facility 
 On July 12, 2022, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to amend and restate the 2021 Credit Facility. The 2022 Credit Facility provides for revolving loans, swing line loans and letters of credit (the "2022 Revolving Line of Credit") up to a maximum aggregate amount of 600 million (the "2022 Revolving Loan Commitment") and a 400 million term loan (the 2022 Term Loan ). The 2022 Term Loan requires quarterly payments ranging from 2.5 million to 7.5 million, commencing September 30, 2022, with a final payment of all remaining principal and interest due on July 12, 2027, which is the 2022 Term Loan s maturity date. All amounts outstanding under the 2022 Revolving Line of Credit will become due on July 12, 2027, which is the termination date of the 2022 Revolving Loan Commitment. The 2022 Credit Facility also permits the LLC, prior to the applicable maturity date, to increase the 2022 Revolving Loan Commitment and/or obtain additional term loans in an aggregate amount of up to 250 million, subject to certain restrictions and conditions. On the closing date for the 2022 Credit Facility, the 2022 Term Loan was advanced in full and the initial borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Revolving Line of Credit were 115 million. We used the initial proceeds from the 2022 Credit Facility to pay all amounts outstanding under the 2021 Credit Facility, pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the 2022 Credit Facility and fund the acquisition of PrimaLoft. 
 Advanced Circuits 
 Termination of Merger Agreement - On October 13, 2021, the LLC, as the Sellers Representative of the holders of stock and options of Advanced Circuits, a majority owned subsidiary of the LLC, entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "AC Agreement") with Tempo Automation, Inc. AC Buyer ), Aspen Acquisition Sub, Inc. AC Merger Sub and Advanced Circuits, pursuant to which AC Buyer would acquire all of the issued and outstanding securities of Advanced Circuits, the parent company of the operating entity, Advanced Circuits, Inc., through a merger of AC Merger Sub with and into Advanced Circuits, with Advanced Circuits surviving the merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of AC Buyer (the AC Merger ). The AC Merger was conditioned on, among other things, the closing of a business combination between AC Buyer and a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company (a SPAC ). In connection with the AC Merger, AC Buyer announced its entry into a definitive merger agreement for a business combination (the SPAC Transaction with a SPAC, ACE Convergence Acquisition Corp. ACE ). The AC Agreement also provided that the AC Agreement could be terminated in the event closing of the AC Merger did not occur prior to January 27, 2022 (the "End Date"). Advanced Circuits was initially classified as held for sale in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021. 
 93 

Due to a delay in closing the SPAC Transaction, the AC Merger did not close on or before the End Date. Because of the delay in closing the SPAC Transaction, on July 29, 2022, the LLC and Advanced Circuits provided the notice of termination of the AC Agreement to AC Buyer. No termination penalties were incurred by either party in connection with the termination of the AC Agreement. The termination of the AC Agreement occurred in the third quarter of 2022 and, in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, Advanced Circuits was reclassified to continuing operations beginning in the quarter ended September 30, 2022. 
 Subsequent Sale - On January 10, 2023, the LLC, solely in its capacity as the representative of the holders of stock and options of Compass AC Holdings, Inc. Advanced Circuits ), a majority owned subsidiary of the LLC, entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger with APCT Inc. ACI Purchaser ), Circuit Merger Sub, Inc. ACI Merger Sub and Advanced Circuits, pursuant to which ACI Purchaser agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding securities of Advanced Circuits, the parent company of the operating entity, Advanced Circuits, Inc., through a merger of ACI Merger Sub with and into Advanced Circuits, with Advanced Circuits surviving the merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of ACI Purchaser (the ACI Merger ). The ACI Merger was completed on February 14, 2023. The sale price of Advanced Circuits was based on an enterprise value of 220 million, subject to certain adjustments based on matters such as the working capital and cash and debt balances of Advanced Circuits at the time of the closing. After the allocation of the sales price to Advanced Circuits non-controlling equity holders and the payment of transaction expenses, CODI received approximately 170 million of total proceeds at closing.

 2023 Outlook and Significant Trends 
 Macroeconomic Trends 
 We continue to experience inflationary cost increases in our materials, labor and transportation costs. We expect that these inflationary cost increases will continue but will be partially mitigated by pricing actions that we have implemented in 2022. However, t here has been, and we expect there could continue to be, a difference between the timing of when these pricing and other actions impact our results of operations and when the impact of cost inflation occurs. We expect changing market conditions and continued inflationary pressures to impact consumer spendin g, particularly for discretionary items purchased by low and middle income consumers. With price pressures unlikely to abate and expected changes in monetary policies, we expect consumer spending to be negatively impacted during 2023. We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to inflation, changes in consumer spending patterns, and global supply chain disruptions. Accordingly, our liquidity and financial results could be impacted in ways that we are not able to predict today. 
 Global Supply Chain Trends 
 We continued to experience disruption in the global supply chain due to overall macroeconomic conditions, volatility in demand and the lingering effect of COVID-19 that led to transportation delays and U.S. port congestion during 2022. While these disruptions and delays have begun to moderate, we expect these disruptions to continue to have a negative impact on several of our subsidiary businesses. During 2022, several of our businesses relied on expensive air freight to import goods to meet customer demand and while most of the transportation costs have normalized during the back half of the year, other aspects of the supply chain have not normalized as we enter 2023. We are seeing the availability of raw materials, components and finished goods impacted by the supply chain challenges which has led to shortages of certain materials and led to pressure on revenue growth. In addition, the closure of certain Asian manufacturing facilities as a result of local government quarantine efforts has impacted our ability to import products timely. We took numerous actions during 2022 to build capacity as well as increase our supply chain related resources, including increasing inventory levels and investing in automated systems to increase production efficiency. Further, in the U.S., the surge in demand along with COVID-19 related labor shortages and rising hourly labor wages, are creating labor shortages and higher labor costs. We expect these cost trends to continue through 2023. 
 COVID-19 Update 
 While we expect the effect of COVID-19 on our businesses to moderate, there is still uncertainty around the 
 94 

continued spread of COVID-19 and new variants of the virus around the world. The economic and health conditions in the United States and across most of the globe have continued to change since the beginning of the pandemic and the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our business is dependent on future developments, including its effect on labor or other macroeconomic factors, its severity and duration, the continued availability and effectiveness of vaccines and actions taken by third parties or by government authorities in response, including restrictions, laws or regulations, or other responses. 
 Business Outlook 
 The Company anticipates that the areas of focus for 2023, which are generally applicable to each of our businesses, include: 
 Achieving sales growth through a combination of new product development, increasing distribution, new customer acquisitions and international expansion; 
 Raising prices, when appropriate, on our goods due to rising input costs to preserve operating margins; 
 Taking market share, where possible, in each of our niche market leading companies, generally at the expense of less well capitalized competitors; 
 Striving for excellence in supply chain management, manufacturing and technological capabilities; 
 Continuing to pursue expense reduction and cost savings in lower margin business lines or in response to lower production volume; 
 Continuing to grow through disciplined, strategic acquisitions and rigorous integration processes; and 
 Driving free cash flow through increased net income and effective working capital management, enabling continued investment in our businesses.

 Year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2021 
 Net revenues 
 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by approximately 331.9 million or 17.2 compared to the corresponding period in 2021. Our Lugano business, which we acquired in September 2021, contributed 147.5 million in incremental net revenue in 2022, and PrimaLoft, which we acquired in July 2022, contributed 24.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021, we also saw significant increases in net sales at 5.11 41.3 million increase), BOA 43.5 million increase), Marucci 47.2 million increase), Arnold 13.9 million 
 96 

increase), and Altor Solutions 81.1 million increase), partially offset by a decrease in net revenue at Velocity Outdoor 38.2 million decrease) and Sterno 23.0 million decrease). Add-on acquisitions at Marucci (Lizard Skins in October 2021), Altor (Plymouth Foam in October 2021) and Arnold (Ramco Motors in March 2021) contributed to the growth in revenue at these businesses in the current year. On a consolidated level, our subsidiary businesses were able to increase revenue in 2022 as compared to the prior year as a result of acquisitions and continued strong performance despite increasing economic uncertainty and inflationary pressure during the back half of the year. We expect 2023 results of operations will continue to be impacted by reduced demand and discretionary consumer spending in certain of our branded consumer and niche industrial businesses. Refer to "Results of Operations - Our Businesses" for a more detailed analysis of net revenue by business segment. 
 We do not generate any revenues apart from those generated by the businesses we own. We may generate interest income on the investment of available funds, but expect such earnings to be minimal. Our investment in our businesses is typically in the form of loans from the Company to such businesses, as well as equity interests in those businesses. Cash flows coming to the Trust and the Company are the result of interest payments on those loans, amortization of those loans and additional principal payments on those loans. However, on a consolidated basis these items will be eliminated. 
 Cost of revenues 
 On a consolidated basis, cost of revenues increased approximately 191.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the corresponding period in 2021, primarily as a result of the increase in net revenues. Our Lugano business contributed 72.7 million of the increase in cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 and our PrimaLoft business contributed 11.0 million of the increase in cost of revenues for 2022. We also saw notable increases in cost of revenues at 5.11 19.5 million increase), BOA 17.7 million increase), Marucci 28.0 million increase), Altor 66.9 million increase), and Arnold 9.0 million increase) that correspond to the revenue increases noted above. We also saw a decrease in cost of revenues at Velocity 15.7 million decrease) and Sterno 18.4 million decrease) that corresponded to the decrease in revenue noted above. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was approximately 40.1 in the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 39.7 in the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Lugano in September 2021 and the implementation of price increases at most of our subsidiary businesses in excess of rising costs. Most of our subsidiary businesses continue to experience increased material, labor and transportation costs . The gross margins at both our branded consumer businesses and our niche industrial businesses have been impa cted by globa l supply chain constraints and inflation that is leading to pressure on revenue and costs. Refer to "Results of Operations - Our Businesses" for a more detailed analysis of gross profit by business segment. 
 Selling, general and administrative expense 
 Consolidated selling, general and administrative expense increased approximately 79.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the corresponding period in 2021. A portion of the increase in the year ended December 31, 2022 is due to our Lugano acquisition in September 2021 28.0 million of the increase) and our PrimaLoft acquisition in July 2022 17.5 million of the increase, of which 5.7 million was attributable to acquisition costs). We also saw increases in selling, general and administrative expenses at Marucci and Altor related to the add-on acquisitions that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2021, as well as increased investment in marketing and headcount at several of our subsidiary businesses with increased revenues. Refer to "Results of Operations - Business Segments" for a more detailed analysis of selling, general and administrative expense by subsidiary business segment. At the corporate level, general and administrative expense was 16.3 million in 2022 and 17.3 million in 2021. Corporate level general and administrative expense during 2021 included non-recurring professional fees associated with our election for the Trust to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 Management fees 
 Pursuant to the Management Services Agreement, we pay CGM a quarterly management fee equal to 0.5 (2.0 annually) of our consolidated adjusted net assets. We accrue for the management fee on a quarterly basis. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred approximately 63.6 million in management fees as compared to 47.5 million in fees in the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in Management fees is primarily attributable to our acquisitions of Lugano in September 2021 and PrimaLoft in July 2022, as well as several add-on acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2021, offset by our sale of Liberty in August 2021. CGM entered into a waiver of 
 97 

the MSA for a period through June 30, 2023 to receive a 1 annual management fee related to PrimaLoft, rather than the 2 called for under the MSA, which resulted in a lower management fee paid in the third quarter of 2022 than would have normally been due. CGM also had entered into a waiver of the MSA for a period through December 31, 2021 to receive a 1 annual management fee related to BOA, rather than the 2 called for under the MSA, which resulted in a lower management fee paid in the first half of 2021 than would have normally been due. In the first quarter of 2021, the LLC and CGM entered into a waiver agreement whereby CGM agreed to waive the portion of the management fee related to the amount of the cash proceeds deposited with the Trustee that was in excess of the amount payable related to the 2026 Notes at March 31, 2021. Additionally, CGM had entered into a waiver of the MSA at March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 to exclude the cash balances held at the LLC from the calculation of the management fee. 
 Amortization expense 
 Amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 14.0 million to 94.4 million as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of the amortization expense associated with the intangibles that were recognized in conjunction with the purchase price allocation for Lugano, which was acquired in September 2021, and PrimaLoft, which was acquired in July 2022. 
 Impairment expense 
 Ergobaby performed an interim impairment test of their goodwill during the period ended December 31, 2022 as a result of operating results that were below historical and forecast amounts. The impairment test resulted in Ergobaby recording impairment expense of 20.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Interest expense 
 We recorded interest expense totaling 83.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 58.8 million for the comparable period in 2021, an increase of 24.7 million. The increase in interest expense in the current year reflects the higher amount outstanding on our senior notes during the current year after we redeemed 600 million of 8.000 2026 Senior Notes and issued 1000 million of 5.250 2029 Senior Notes in March of 2021, and issued 300 million of 5.000 2032 Senior Notes in November 2021, and higher amounts outstanding on our revolving credit facility in the current year, as well as the interest expense associated with our new 400 million 2022 Term Loan that we entered into in July 2022 in connection with our acquisition of PrimaLoft. Current year interest expense also reflects the higher interest rate environment applicable to the amounts outstanding under our credit facility. While the actual timing and extent of the future increases in interest rates remains unknown, higher long-term interest rates are expected to increase interest expense on the debt outstanding under our 2022 Credit Facility. 
 Provision for income taxes 
 We had income tax expense of 45.0 million with an effective income tax rate of 51.7 during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to income tax expense of 21.8 million with an effective income tax rate of 31.9 during the same period in 2021. Our net income from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 18.9 million as compared to income from continuing operations before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 87.1 million in 2022 compared to 68.1 million in 2021). Our income tax provision increased by 23.3 million in 2022 as compared to 2021. Our income from continuing operations before taxes in 2021 included a 33.3 million loss on debt extinguishment that we recognized associated with the repayment of our 600 million 2026 Senior Notes. The loss on debt extinguishment was incurred at the Trust, which at the time was taxed as a partnership for income tax purposes and did not impact the income tax provision in the prior year. On September 1, 2021, the Trust elected to check-the-box to have the Trust treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 In the current year, our provision was driven by the acquisitions of Lugano in September 2021, and an increase in earnings at several of our subsidiary businesses during the year, particularly 5.11, BOA and Marucci, as well as the reversal of a 12.1 million tax benefit recognized in the prior year as a result of the accounting treatment of Advanced Circuits as held-for-sale at December 31, 2021. This benefit reversed in the third quarter of 2022 when Advanced Circuits no longer qualified as held-for-sale. The Company's effective tax rate fluctuates based on, among other factors, where income is earned, the level of income relative to tax attributes and the loss incurred at the Trust related to corporate overhead and management fees incurred. The tax provision reflects the effect of state and local taxes, foreign taxes and the related allocation of income at our subsidiaries, in addition to the effect of the losses at our parent company.

Year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2020 
 Net revenues 
 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by approximately 484.5 million or 33.5 compared to the corresponding period in 2020. Our Marucci business, which we acquired in April 2020, contributed 74.7 million in incremental net revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021, and our BOA business, which we acquired in October 2020, contributed 139.9 million in incremental revenue in 2021. Our Lugano business, which we acquired in September 2021, had 54.4 million in revenue during the period of our ownership. During the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, we saw notable sales increases at 5.11 43.9 million increase), and Velocity 54.4 million increase) as a result of an increased consumer focus on outdoor related brands. Our Altor Solutions business also saw an increase in net revenues of 50.2 million, primarily as a result of add-on acquisitions that occurred in July 2020 and October 2020. We also saw notable increases in net revenue in 2021 as compared to 2020 at several of our other business which saw increased sales compared to the prior year, which was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These increases in net revenue occurred at Ergobaby 18.9 million increase), Arnold 41.0 million increase, which was partially attributable to an add-on acquisition in March 2021) and Sterno 5.1 million increase). Refer to "Results of Operations - Our Businesses" for a more detailed analysis of net revenue by business segment. 
 We do not generate any revenues apart from those generated by the businesses we own. We may generate interest income on the investment of available funds, but expect such earnings to be minimal. Our investment in our businesses is typically in the form of loans from the Company to such businesses, as well as equity interests in those businesses. Cash flows coming to the Trust and the Company are the result of interest payments on those loans, amortization of those loans and additional principal payments on those loans. However, on a consolidated basis these items will be eliminated. 
 Cost of revenues 
 On a consolidated basis, cost of revenues increased approximately 251.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the corresponding period in 2020, primarily as a result of the increase in net revenues. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was approximately 39.7 in year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 36.9 in 2020. We recognized 5.9 million in expense related to the amortization of the inventory step-up resulting from our purchase price allocation of Marucci Sports and BOA and Altor's acquisition of Polyfoam during the year ended December 31, 2020, and 2.8 million in expense related to the inventory step-up resulting from our purchase price allocation for Lugano during the year-ended December 31, 2021. Excluding the effect of the amortization of inventory step-up, gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was 40.0 and 37.1 , respectively, for 2021 and 2020. The increase in gross profit percentage in 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily related to the increase in net revenue at our branded consumer businesses, which have higher gross margins than our niche industrial businesses. The gross margins at our niche industrial businesses have been impact ed by globa l supply chain constraints and increased costs of materials and components. The impact from these factors has been mostly offset by gains in operating efficiencies and price increases to our customers. Refer to "Results of Operations - Our Businesses" for a more detailed analysis of gross profit by business segment. 
 Selling, general and administrative expense 
 Consolidated selling, general and administrative expense increased approximately 114.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the corresponding period in 2020. 20.2 million of the increase is attributable to our Marucci business, which was acquired in April 2020, and 38.9 million of the increase is attributable to BOA, which was acquired in October 2020. 12.0 million of the increase is attributable to Lugano, including 1.8 million in transaction costs related to the acquisition of Lugano in the current year. We also saw an increase in selling, general and administrative expense at several of our subsidiaries versus the prior year as spending on variable expenses was reduced in the prior year in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the current year spend reflecting more normal levels of selling, general and administrative spend. Refer to "Results of Operations - Our Businesses" for a more detailed analysis of selling, general and administrative expense by business segment. At the corporate level, general and administrative expense increased from 14.2 million in 2020 to 17.3 million in 2021. The increase in corporate general and administrative expense during 2021 is primarily due to increased professional fees associated with our election for the Trust to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and an increase in variable spending that had been reduced in the prior year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Fees to manager 
 Pursuant to the Management Services Agreement, we pay CGM a quarterly management fee equal to 0.5 (2.0 annually) of our consolidated adjusted net assets. We accrue for the management fee on a quarterly basis. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred approximately 47.5 million in management fees as compared to 34.2 million in fees in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in management fees is primarily attributable to our acquisition of Marucci in April 2020, BOA in October 2020 and Lugano in September 2021, offset by our sale of Liberty in August 2021. CGM has entered into a waiver of the MSA for a period through December 31, 2021 to receive a 1 annual management fee related to BOA, rather than the 2 called for under the MSA, which resulted in a lower management fee paid during 2021 than would have normally been due. In the first quarter of 2021, the Company and CGM entered into a waiver agreement whereby CGM agreed to waive the portion of the management fee related to the amount of the cash proceeds deposited with the Trustee that was in excess of the amount payable related to the 2026 Notes at March 31, 2021. Additionally, CGM has entered into a waiver of the MSA at December 31, 2021 to exclude the cash balances held at the LLC from the calculation of the management fee. I n the first quarter of 2020, as a proactive measure to provide the Company with additional liquidity in light of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company drew 200 million down on the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. The Company and CGM entered a waiver agreement whereby CGM agreed to waive the portion of the management fee attributable to cash balances at March 31, 2020 which reduced the amount of management fee that would have been paid in the first quarter of 2020. Additionally, as a result of an expected decline in earnings and cash flows in the second quarter of 2020 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, CGM agreed to waive 50 of the management fee calculated at June 30, 2020. 
 Amortization expense 
 Amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased 18.4 million to 80.3 million as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of the acquisitions of Marucci in April 2020 and BOA in October 2020 and Lugano in September 2021. 
 Interest Expense 
 We recorded interest expense totaling 58.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 45.8 million for the comparable period in 2020, an increase of 13.1 million. The increase in interest expense in the current year reflects the higher amount outstanding on our senior notes during the current year after we redeemed 600.0 million of our 8.000 2026 Senior Notes and issued 1,000.0 million of 5.250 2029 Notes in March of 2021, and issued an additional 300.0 million of 5.000 Senior Notes due in 2032 in November 2021. We also had an increase in the average amount outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility during 2021 compared to the prior year. The average amount outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility in 2021 was approximately 125.2 million, while the average amount outstanding during 2020 was 101.4 million. 
 Income Taxes 
 We had income tax expense of 21.8 million with an effective income tax rate of 31.9 during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to income tax expense of 13.6 million with an effective income tax rate of 50.1 during the same period in 2020. Our net income from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased 41.0 million as compared to income from continuing operations before taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 68.1 million in 2021 compared to 27.2 million in 2020). Our income tax provision increased by 8.2 million in 2021 as compared to 2020. The tax provision reflects the effect of state and local taxes, foreign taxes and the related allocation of income at our subsidiaries, in addition to the effect of the losses at our parent company. The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 includes a loss at our parent company, which was previously taxed as a partnership. 
 On September 1, 2021, the Trust elected to check-the-box to have the Trust treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Trust recorded a deferred tax benefit of 12.1 million at December 31, 2021 to reflect the effect of the classification of ACI as held-for-sale.

 Year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2021 
 Net sales 
 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 486.2 million, an increase of 41.3 million, or 9.3 , compared to the same period in 2021. This increase is due primarily to direct-to-consumer growth of 19.6 million, up 10 from the prior year comparable period. Retail sales grew largely due to store count growth, as well as positive growth in same-store sales for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period last year. Net sales were also positively impacted by a 19.4 million, or 23.6 , increase in international sales due to strong demand, and a 7.2 million, or 5 , increase in domestic wholesale sales growth following the fulfillment of backorders and strong demand. 
 Gross profit 
 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 52.9 in both the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Gross profit percentage was favorably impacted by price increases, customer mix and product mix, all of which were offset by increased inbound ocean freight charges during the period due to logistic challenges during the year. 
 Selling, general and administrative expense 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased to 203.7 million or 41.9 of net sales compared to 186.1 million or 41.8 of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was driven by the costs associated with additional retail stores, increased sales and marketing spend to drive digital sales, and increased travel and entertainment spend coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in bonus related expenses, outside service expenses, variable marketplace expenses and stock-based compensation.

Segment operating income 
 Segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 43.5 million, an increase of 4.2 million when compared to the same period in 2021, based on the factors described above. 
 Year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2020 
 Net sales 
 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 were 445.0 million, an increase of 43.9 million, or 10.9 , compared to the same period in 2020. This increase is due primarily to direct-to-consumer growth of 35.0 million, up 22 from the prior year comparable period. Retail sales grew largely due to fifteen new retail store openings since December 2020 (bringing the total store count to eighty-seven as of December 31, 2021) as well as positive growth in same-store sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period last year which was negatively impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Net sales were also positively impacted by wholesale sales growth of 18.6 million, up 8 from the prior year which was negatively impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in sales from direct-to-consumer and wholesale was partially offset by a decrease of 8.4 million in sales in our direct to agency business (DTA) as we fulfilled a large contract in 2020 which did not repeat in 2021. 
 Gross profit 
 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 50.4 in the year ended December 31, 2020 to 52.9 in the year ended December 31, 2021. Growth in gross margin was driven by channel mix as direct-to-consumer sales, which realize a higher gross margin than wholesale sales, grew versus the prior period. The growth in gross profit percentage for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was partially offset by increases in inbound ocean and air freight as logistic challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic increased supply chain costs. 
 Selling, general and administrative expense 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased to 186.1 million or 41.8 of net sales compared to 162.4 million or 40.5 of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year comparable period was driven by th e costs associated with additional retail stores (eighty-seven open in 2021 versus seventy-three open in 2020 during the comparable period), as well as additional sales and marketing spend to drive digital sales . For the year ended December 31, 2020, management significantly reduced variable expenses, including payroll, bonus, travel and entertainment, and sales and marketing, as a response to decreased sales from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. While management continues to control and reduce variable expenses, payroll and bonus for fiscal 2021 increased in correlation with the increase in net sales.

 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 165.4 million, an increase of 47.2 million as compared to net sales of 118.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net sales was due to Marucci's acquisition of Lizard Skins in the fourth quarter of 2021, as well as increased customer demand and market share in many of Marucci's key product lines, including aluminum and wood bats, and batting gloves. 
 Gross profit 
 Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 19.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.

The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily d ue to increased freight costs during the first half of 2022, as delays in Marucci's supply chain coupled with demand exceeding the company's forecast led to increased use of air freight to meet increased demand from Marucci's customer base. 
 Selling, general and administrative expense 
 Selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 52.3 million, or 31.6 of net sales compared to 40.8 million, or 34.5 of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021.

 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 were 118.2 million, an increase of 52.2 million as compared to net sales of 65.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net sales was primarily due to increased customer demand and market share in many of Marucci's key product lines including aluminum and wood bats, batting gloves, and bags. The increased sales from these products occurred in both retail and direct channels. In the prior year, the shutdown of professional and youth baseball and softball in March as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant drop off in demand for product through the first half of 2020, with demand beginning to pick up during the back half of 2020 after the resumption of professional and youth sports.

Excluding the effect of the inventory step-up, the gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 57.7 . During the current year, Marucci's facilities in Baton Rouge were damaged by floodwaters, which resulted in the write-off of 1.8 million in inventory, negatively impacting the gross profit in 2021 and resulting in a decrease versus adjusted gross profit percentage from 2020. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales during the year ended December 31, 2021 was also impacted by various factors including a shift of product mix in favor of higher margin products, mainly its aluminum bats, and channel mix, with increased sales through Marucci's higher margin direct-to-consumer and e-commerce channels, as well as increased freight costs.

 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 22.2 and 24.3 , respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to increases in the price of Altor's primary raw material, expanded polystyrene ("EPS"), and increased operating costs, particularly labor. We expect gross profit as a percentage of net sales to improve in the near to intermediate term as we have contractual price increases planned and we expect raw material input costs to stabilize.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We generate cash primarily from the operations of our subsidiaries, and we have the ability to borrow under our 2022 Credit Facility to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. In 2021, we filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to which we may, but we have no obligation to, issue and sell up to 500 million shares of the common shares of the Trust in amounts and at times to be determined by us. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including, market conditions, the trading price of Trust common shares and determinations by us regarding appropriate sources of funding. Our principal uses of cash are operating expenses, payment of management fees, capital expenditures, working capital needs, debt service, dividends on our common and preferred Trust shares, and strategic growth initiatives, including acquisitions. We had total available cash and cash equivalents of 61.3 million and 160.7 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,000 million of indebtedness associated with our 5.250 2029 Notes, 300 million of indebtedness associated with our 5.000 2032 Notes, 395 million outstanding on our 2022 Term Loan, and 155 million outstanding on our 2022 Revolving Credit Facility. Only our 2022 Term Loan has required principal payments. Long-term debt liquidity requirements consist of the payment in full of our Notes upon their respective maturity dates, amounts outstanding under our 2022 Revolving Credit Facility upon its maturity date, and principal payments under our 2022 Term Loan. The 2022 Term Loan requires quarterly payments ranging from 2.5 million to 7.5 million, commencing September 30, 2022, with a final payment of all remaining principal and interest due on July 12, 2027, which is the 2022 Term Loan s maturity date.

 2022 
 Cash flows used in operating activities totaled approximately 28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which represents a decrease of 162.3 million compared to cash flow provided by operating activities of 134.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in cash flows in 2022 is primarily attributable to an increase in cash used for working capital. Cash used in operating activities for working capital for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 252.4 million, as compared to cash used in operating activities for working capital of 83.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. We typically have a higher usage of cash for working capital in the first half of the year as most of our companies will build up inventories after the fourth quarter; however, in the current year, several of our subsidiary businesses substantially increased inventory levels to combat supply chain issues given longer lead times, resulting in higher cash outflows throughout the year. The increase in cash used in operating activities for working capital in 2022 also reflects the acquisition of Lugano in the third quarter of the prior year. Lugano has used significant cash to build inventory to support its sales growth strategy (approximately 89.8 million in cash used for inventory purchases in 2022). 
 2021 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled approximately 134.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which represented a decrease of 14.6 million compared to cash flow from operating activities of 148.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

 119 

the first half of the year as most of our companies will build up inventories after the fourth quarter. In 2021, several of our businesses had higher inventory levels than normal given s ignificantly longer lead times due to supply chain issues, which led to higher levels of inventory at December 31, 2021. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led our businesses to implement a variety of steps to conserve cash and increase liquidity given the uncertainty in the economy, resulting in a lower usage of cash for working capital. The increase in cash used in operating activities for working capital also reflected the acquisitions of Marucci Sports and BOA in the second and fourth quarter, respectively, of 2020, and Lugano in the third quarter of 2021. 
 2020 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled approximately 148.6 million for December 31, 2020, which represented an increase of 64.1 million compared to cash flow from operating activities of 84.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash flows in 2020 was attributable to an increase in income from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2020, driven by strong performance at our 5.11, Liberty and Velocity businesses, and an increase in cash provided by working capital. In 2019, the Company incurred interest expense related to the 2018 Term Loan, which we paid off in the third and fourth quarter of 2019 using the proceeds from the sale of Clean Earth and our Series C Preferred Share Offering. The payoff of the 2018 Term Loan, partially offset by the increase in interest expense related to 200 million in our 8 Senior Notes issued in May 2020, resulted in a decrease in our interest expense in 2020 as compared to 2019 by approximately 12.4 million. In 2019, we also recognized a loss of 10.2 million related to the sale of common shares received as part of the consideration for the sale of Manitoba Harvest. Cash provided by operating activities for working capital for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 3.3 million as compared to cash used in operating activities for working capital of 15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash provided by working capital in 2020 primarily reflects steps our businesses took to maintain liquidity in the economic climate in 2020.

 Each loan has a scheduled maturity and each business is entitled to repay all or a portion of the principal amount of the outstanding loans, without penalty, prior to maturity. A component of our acquisition financing strategy that we utilize in acquiring the businesses we own and manage is to provide both equity capital and debt capital, raised at the parent level through our existing credit facility. Our strategy of providing intercompany debt financing within the capital structure of the businesses that we acquire and manage allows us the ability to distribute cash to the parent company through monthly interest payments and amortization of the principle on these intercompany loans. Certain of our businesses have paid down their respective intercompany debt balances through the cash flow generated by these businesses and we have recapitalized, and expect to continue to recapitalize, these businesses in the normal course of our business. The recapitalization process involves funding the intercompany debt using either cash on hand at the parent or our revolving credit facility, and serves the purpose of optimizing the capital structure at our subsidiaries and providing the noncontrolling shareholders with a distribution on their ownership interest in a cash flow positive business. 
 In February 2022, we completed a recapitalization at Ergobaby whereby the LLC entered into an amendment to the intercompany loan agreement with Ergobaby (the "Ergobaby Loan Agreement"). The Ergobaby Loan Agreement was amended to provide for additional term loan borrowings of 61.5 million to fund a distribution to shareholders. The LLC owned 81.6 of the outstanding shares of Ergobaby on the date of the distribution and received 50.2 million. The remaining amount of the distribution was paid to minority shareholders. 
 In August 2021, we completed a recapitalization at 5.11 whereby the Company entered into an amendment to the intercompany loan agreement with 5.11 (the "5.11 Loan Agreement"). The 5.11 Loan Agreement was amended to provide for additional term loan borrowings of 55.0 million to fund a distribution to shareholders. The Company owned 97.7 of the outstanding shares of 5.11 on the date of the distribution and received 53.7 million. The remaining amount of the distribution went to minority shareholders. 
 In November 2020, the Company completed a recapitalization of ACI whereby the Company entered into an amendment to the intercompany loan agreement with ACI (the "ACI Loan Agreement"). The ACI Loan Agreement was amended to (i) provide for term loan borrowings of 48.8 million to fund the repurchase of shares from an existing shareholder and to fund a distribution to shareholders, and ii) extend the maturity dates of the term loans, and termination date of the revolving loan commitment. In connection with the recapitalization, ACI repurchased 47,870 shares of ACI capital stock, and distributed 42.8 million to shareholders. The Company owned 71.8 of the outstanding shares of ACI on the date of the distribution and received 30.7 million. The remaining amount of the distribution went to minority shareholders.

In September 2021, BOA repurchased shares of its issued and outstanding common shares from its largest minority shareholder for a total payment of 48.0 million, which BOA financed by borrowing under their intercompany credit facility with the Company (the "BOA Credit Agreement"). The BOA Credit Agreement was amended to (i) provide for additional term loan borrowings of 38.0 million, and (ii) consent to the repurchase of the shares from the minority shareholder. 
 In the first quarter of 2022, we amended the 5.11 intercompany credit agreement to increase the capital expenditures allowable under the agreement to account for additional growth capital expenditure opportunities primarily related to retail expansion, and amended the financial covenants to reflect the increased allowable expenditure. The 5.11 credit agreement was amended again in both the third and fourth quarters to increase the amount available under the revolving credit facility, as well as to increase the capital expenditures allowable under the credit agreement. 
 During the first quarter of 2022, the Lugano intercompany credit agreement was amended to increase the amount available under the revolving credit facility to permit additional investment in inventory, and amended the financial covenants to reflect the increase in the revolving credit facility. We amended the Lugano intercompany credit agreement again in the second quarter of 2022 to increase the amount in available under the revolving credit facility to permit additional investment in inventory, and amended the financial covenants to reflect the increase in the revolving credit facility. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Lugano intercompany credit agreement was amended to allow for an additional Term A Loan. 
 During the third quarter of 2022, we amended the Velocity intercompany credit agreement to increase the amount of the Velocity term loan to allow for the financing of an add-on acquisition. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2022, we amended the Altor credit agreement to allow for additional capital expenditures related to our Ohio plant relocation. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2021, we amended the Arnold intercompany credit agreement to increase capital expenditure allowable under the credit agreement to account for additional growth capital expenditure opportunities, and amended the financial covenants to reflect the increased allowable expenditure. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we amended the Arnold intercompany credit agreement to increase the revolving credit commitment available under the credit agreement, and amended the financial covenants to reflect the increased commitment. 
 All of our subsidiaries were in compliance with the financial covenants included within their intercompany credit arrangements at December 31, 2022. 
 Our primary source of cash is from the receipt of interest and principal on our outstanding loans to our businesses. Accordingly, we are dependent upon the earnings and cash flow of these businesses, which are available for (i) operating expen ses; (ii) payment of interest and principal on our outstanding debt; (iii) payments to CGM due or potentially due pursuant to the MSA and the LLC Agreement; (iv) cash distributio ns to our shareholders; and (v) investments in future acquisitions. Payments made under (i) through (iii) above are required to be paid before distributions to shareholders and may be significant and exceed the funds held by us, which may require us to dispose of assets or incur debt to fund such expenditures. Each of our subsidiaries has various non-cancelable commitments in the ordinary course of business, including operating lease payments, and purchase obligations which include payments for materials and payments under employment agreements. On a consolidated basis at December 31, 2022, we had future operating lease obligations of 241.4 million and purchase obligations of 204.6 million. 
 We believe that we currently have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our existing obligations, including quarterly distributions to our shareholders, as approved by our board of directors, over the next twelve months. 
 Financing Arrangements 
 2022 Credit Facility 
 On July 12, 2022, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "2022 Credit Facility") to amend and restate the 2021 Credit Facility. The 2022 Credit Facility provides for revolving loans, swing line loans and letters of credit up to a maximum aggregate amount of 600 million (the "2022 Revolving Credit Facility") and also permits the LLC, prior to the applicable maturity date, to increase the revolving loan commitment and/or obtain term loans in an aggregate amount of up to 250 million, subject to certain restrictions and conditions. All amounts outstanding under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility will become due on July 12, 2027, which is the maturity date of loans advanced under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility. The 2022 Credit Facility also provides for a 400 million 
 123 

term loan (the 2022 Term Loan ). The 2022 Term Loan requires quarterly payments ranging from 2.5 million to 7.5 million, commencing September 30, 2022, with a final payment of all remaining principal and interest due on July 12, 2027, which is the 2022 Term Loan s maturity date. 
 The 2022 Credit Facility is secured by all of the assets of the Company, including all of its equity interests in, and loans to, its consolidated subsidiaries. At December 31, 2022, we had letters of credit totaling 2.2 million outstanding under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility. We had approximately 442.8 million in borrowing base availability under this facility at December 31, 2022. (See " Note I - Debt " to the consolidated financial statements for more detail regarding our 2022 Credit Facility). 
 2021 Credit Facility 
 On March 23, 2021, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to amend and restate the 2018 Credit Facility. The 2021 Credit Facility provided for revolving loans, swing line loans and letters of credit up to a maximum aggregate amount of 600 million and also permitted the LLC, prior to the applicable maturity date, to increase the revolving loan commitment and/or obtain term loans in an aggregate amount of up to 250 million, subject to certain restrictions and conditions. The Company repaid the outstanding amounts under the 2021 credit facility in the third quarter of 2022 in connection with entering into the 2022 Credit Facility. 
 2018 Credit Facility 
 In April 2018, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "2018 Credit Facility") to amend and restate our credit agreement entered into in 2014. The 2018 Credit Facility provided for (i) revolving loans, swing line loans and letters of credit (the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility up to a maximum aggregate amount of 600 million, and (ii) a 500 million term loan (the 2018 Term Loan ). The 2018 Credit Facility also permitted the Company, prior to the applicable maturity date, to increase the revolving loan commitment and/or obtain additional term loans in an aggregate amount of up to 250 million, subject to certain restrictions and conditions. In 2019, we repaid the amounts due under the 2018 Term Loan. We used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes offering to pay all amounts outstanding under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility in March 2021. The 2018 Credit Facility was replaced by the 2021 Credit Facility.

 We intend to use the availability under our 2022 Credit Facility and cash on hand to pursue acquisitions of additional businesses, to fund distributions (if and to the extent approved by our board of directors) and to provide for other working capital needs. 
 Interest Expense 
 We incurred interest expense totaling 83.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 58.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 and 45.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

 Income Taxes 
 On August 3, 2021, the shareholders of CODI approved amendments to the Second Amended and Restated Trust Agreement of the Trust and the Fifth Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of the Company to allow the Company s Board of Directors (the Board to cause the Trust to elect to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (the tax reclassification and, at its discretion in the future, cause the Trust to be converted to a corporation. Following the shareholder vote, the Board resolved to cause the Trust to elect to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such election became effective September 1, 2021, prior to which the Trust had been taxed as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes since January 1, 2007. The Company was treated as a partnership prior to the Trust s tax reclassification and it will continue to be treated as a 
 125 

partnership following the Trust s tax reclassification. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recorded a 12.1 million deferred tax benefit as a result of the accounting treatment of Advanced Circuits as held-for-sale at December 31, 2021. This benefit reversed in the third quarter of 2022 when Advanced Circuits no longer qualified as held-for-sale. 
 Each of the Company s majority owned subsidiaries are subject to Federal, state and in some cases, foreign income taxes. We recorded an income tax provision of 45.0 million with an annual effective rate of 51.7 during the year ended December 31, 2022, an income tax provision of 21.8 million with an annual effective tax rate of 31.9 during the year ended December 31, 2021, and 13.6 million in income tax benefit with an effective tax rate of 50.1 during the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 The components of our income tax (benefit) expense as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are as follows: 
 Year ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 United States Federal Statutory Rate 21.0 21.0 21.0 State income taxes (net of Federal benefits) 5.3 2.7 7.6 Foreign income taxes 2.7 5.3 6.1 Expenses of Compass Group Diversified Holdings LLC

 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 GAAP or U.S. GAAP refer to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. From time to time we may publicly disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures in the course of our investor presentations, earnings releases, earnings conference calls or other venues. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of historical or future performance, financial position or cash flow that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that effectively exclude amounts, included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our financial statements, and vice versa for measures that include amounts, or are subject to adjustments that effectively include amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure as calculated and presented. 
 Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide them with an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results. These measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may be different from or otherwise inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures supplements other metrics we use to internally evaluate our subsidiary businesses and facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. 
 The tables below reconcile the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA"), Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Earnings. 
 126 

EBITDA EBITDA is calculated as net income (loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), loss on debt extinguishment, depreciation expense and amortization expense. Amortization expenses consist of amortization of intangibles and debt charges, including debt issuance costs, discounts, etc. 
 Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is calculated utilizing the same calculation as described above in arriving at EBITDA further adjusted by: (i) non-controlling stockholder compensation, which generally consists of non-cash stock option expense; (ii) successful acquisition costs, which consist of transaction costs (legal, accounting, due diligence, etc.) incurred in connection with the successful acquisition of a business expensed during the period in compliance with ASC 805; (iii) impairment charges, which reflect write downs to goodwill or other intangible assets; (iv) changes in the fair value of contingent consideration subsequent to initial purchase accounting, (v) integration service fees, which reflect fees paid by newly acquired companies to the Manager for integration services performed during the first year of ownership; and (vi) items of other income or expense that are material to a subsidiary and non-recurring in nature. 
 Adjusted Earnings Adjusted earnings is calculated as net income (loss) adjusted to include the cost of the distributions to preferred shareholders, and adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items the exclusion of which management believes provides insight regarding our ongoing operating performance. Depending on the period presented, these adjusted measures exclude the impact of certain of the following items: gains (losses) and income (loss) from discontinued operations, income (loss) from noncontrolling interest, amortization expense, subsidiary stock compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses and items of other income or expense that may be material to a subsidiary and non-recurring in nature. 
 We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Earnings provide useful information to investors and reflect important financial measures that are used by management in the monthly analysis of our operating results and in preparation of our annual budgets. We believe that investors understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing these performance measures as this presentation allows investors to view the performance of our businesses in a manner similar to the methods used by us and the management of our subsidiary businesses, provides additional insight into our operating results and provides a measure for evaluating targeted businesses for acquisition. 
 We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Earnings provide useful information to investors and reflects important financial measures as they exclude the effects of items which reflect the impact of long-term investment decisions, rather than the performance of near-term operations. When compared to net income (loss) and net income (loss) from continuing operations, Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, are each limited in that they do not reflect the periodic costs of certain capital assets used in generating revenues of our subsidiary businesses or the non-cash charges associated with impairments, as well as certain cash charges. The presentation of Adjusted Earnings provides insight into our operating results and provides a measure for evaluating earnings from continuing operations available to common shareholders. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Earnings are not meant to be a substitute for GAAP, and may be different from or otherwise inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.

Seasonality 
 The following table presents the net sales by quarter as a percentage of our annual net sales. 
 Year Ended December 31, Quarter ended 2022 2021 2020 March 31st 23.6 22.3 21.3 June 30th 23.8 23.5 21.4 September 30th 26.4 25.3 26.8 December 31st 26.2 28.9 30.5 
 Earnings of certain of our operating segments are seasonal in nature due to various recurring events, holidays and seasonal weather patterns, as well as the timing of our acquisitions during a given year. Historically, the third and fourth quarter have produced the highest net sales in our fiscal year, however, due to various acquisitions in the last three years, there is generally less seasonality in our net sales on a consolidated basis than there has been historically. 
 
 Related Party Transactions and Certain Transactions Involving our Businesses 
 We have entered into related party transactions with our Manager, CGM including the following: 
 Management Services Agreement 
 LLC Agreement 
 Integration Services Agreements 
 Cost Reimbursement and Fees 
 Management Services Agreement 
 We entered into the MSA with CGM effective May 16, 2006. Our Chief Executive Officer is a partner of CGM. The MSA provides for, among other things, CGM to perform services for us in exchange for a management fee paid quarterly and equal to 0.5 of our adjusted net assets. The management fee is required to be paid prior to the payment of any distributions to shareholders. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we incurred 63.6 million, 47.4 million, and 34.2 million, respectively, in management fees to CGM. 
 Pursuant to the MSA, CGM is entitled to enter into off-setting management service agreements with each of the operating segments. The amount of the fee is negotiated between CGM and the operating management of each segment and is based upon the value of the services to be provided. The fees paid directly to CGM by the segments offset on a dollar for dollar basis the amount due CGM by the LLC under the MSA. 
 During 2022, CGM entered into a waiver of the MSA for the period through June 30, 2023 to receive a 1 annual management fee related to PrimaLoft, rather than the 2 called for under the MSA, which resulted in a lower management fee at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022 than would normally have been due. At June 30, 2022 and March 31, 2022, CGM entered into a waiver to exclude cash balances held at the LLC from the calculation of the management fee. 
 During 2021, CGM entered into a waiver of the MSA for a period through December 31, 2021 to receive a 1 annual management fee related to BOA, rather than the 2 called for under the MSA, which resulted in a lower management fee paid during 2021 than would have normally been due. In the first quarter of 2021, the LLC and CGM entered into a waiver agreement whereby CGM agreed to waive the portion of the management fee related to the amount of the proceeds deposited with the Trustee that was in excess of the amount payable related to the 2026 Senior Notes at March 31, 2021. Additionally, CGM entered into a waiver of the MSA at December 31, 2021 to exclude the cash balances held at the LLC from the calculation of the management fee. 
 In March 2020, as a proactive measure to provide the LLC with additional cash liquidity in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the LLC elected to draw down 200 million on our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. The LLC and CGM entered into a waiver agreement whereby CGM agreed to waive the portion of the management fee attributable to the cash balances held at the LLC as of March 31, 2020. In addition, due to the unprecedented uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, CGM agreed to waive 50 of the management fee calculated at June 30, 2020 that was paid in July 2020. Further, for the third quarter of 2020, the LLC and CGM entered into a waiver agreement 
 135 

whereby CGM agreed to waive the portion of the management fee attributable to the cash balances held at the LLC as of September 30, 202 0. 
 The LLC paid CGM 0.4 million and 0.1 million, respectively, in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, representing the management fee due from Arnold for the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first three quarters of 2021. At December 31, 2021, Arnold reimbursed the LLC for the management fee paid on their behalf. 
 LLC Agreement 
 As distinguished from its provision of providing management services to us, pursuant to the amended MSA, members of CGM are owners of 50.0 of the Allocation Interests in us through their ownership in Sostratus LLC. The LLC agreement gives the holders of Allocation Interests the right to distributions pursuant to a profit allocation formula upon the occurrence of a Sale Event or a Holding Event. The Allocation Interest Holders are entitled to receive and as such can elect to receive the positive contribution-based profit allocation payment for each of the business acquisitions during the 30-day period following the fifth anniversary of the date upon which we acquired a controlling interest in that business (Holding Event) and upon the sale of the business (Sale Event). Holders received 34.1 million and 9.1 million in distributions related to Sale and Holding Events that occurred during 2021 and 2020, respectively. No allocation interest distributions were made in 2022. Refer to " Note K - Stockholders' Equity " for a description of the profit allocation payments. 
 Certain persons who are employees and partners of the Manager, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer, beneficially own (through Sostratus LL C) 62.0 of the Allocation Interests at December 31, 2022 and 57.8 at December 31, 2021. Of the remaining 38.0 at December 31, 2022 and 42.2 at December 31, 2021, 5.0 is held by CGI Diversified Holdings L P, 5.0 i s held by a director on the Company s Board of Directors, and the remaining percentage of Allocation Interests are held by the former founding partners of the Manager. 
 Integration Services Agreements 
 Integration services represent fees paid by newly acquired companies to the Manager for integration services performed during the first year of ownership. Under the Integration Services Agreement ("ISA"), CGM provides services for new platform acquisitions to, amongst other things, assist the management at the acquired entities in establishing a corporate governance program, implement compliance and reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and align the acquired entity's policies and procedures with our other subsidiaries. 
 PrimaLoft, which was acquired in July 2022, entered into an ISA with CGM whereby PrimaLoft will pay CGM a total integration services fee of 4.8 million, payable quarterly over a twelve-month period ended June 30, 2023. 
 Lugano, which was acquired in September 2021, entered into an ISA with CGM whereby Lugano will pay CGM a total integration services fee of 2.3 million, payable quarterly over a twelve month period beginning in the quarter ended December 31, 2021. 
 BOA, which was acquired in October 2020 and Marucci Sports, which was acquired in April 2020, each entered into an ISA with CGM. Each ISA was for the twelve month period subsequent to the acquisition and was payable quarterly. BOA paid CGM a total of 4.4 million under the ISA, beginning in the quarter ended December 31, 2020. Marucci paid CGM a total of 2.0 million in integration services fees, beginning in the quarter ended September 30, 2020. 
 During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, CGM receiv ed 4.1 million, 4.9 million, and 2.1 million, respectively, in total integration service fees. 
 Cost Reimbursement and Fees 
 We reimbursed CGM approximately 6.5 million, 5.4 million, and 5.2 million, principally for occupancy and staffing costs incurred by CGM on our behalf during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 The Company and its businesses have the following significant related party transactions: 
 5.11 
 Related Party Vendor Purchases - 5.11 purchases inventory from a vendor who is a related party to 5.11 through one of the executive officers of 5.11 via the executive's 40 ownership interest in the vendor. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, 5.11 purchased approximately 2.0 million, 1.1 million, and 2.7 million, respectively, in inventory from the vendor. 
 136 

Recapitalization - In August 2021, the Company completed a recapitalization of 5.11 whereby the Company entered into an amendment to the intercompany loan agreement with 5.11 (the "5.11 Loan Agreement"). The 5.11 Loan Agreement was amended to provide for additional term loan borrowings of 55.0 million to fund a distribution to shareholders. The Company owned 97.7 of the outstanding shares of 5.11 on the date of the distribution and received 53.7 million. The remaining amount of the distribution went to minority shareholders. 
 BOA 
 Repurchase of Noncontrolling Interest - In September 2021, BOA repurchased shares of its issued and outstanding common shares from its largest minority shareholder for a total payment of 48.0 million, which BOA financed by borrowing under their intercompany credit facility with the Company (the "BOA Credit Agreement"). The BOA Credit Agreement was amended to (i) provide for additional term loan borrowings of 38.0 million, and (ii) consent to the repurchase of the shares from the minority shareholder. The transaction was accounted for in accordance with ASC 810 - Consolidation, whereby the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest was adjusted to reflect the change in the ownership interest in BOA that occurred as a result of the share repurchase. The difference between the fair value of the consideration paid of 48.0 million and the amount by which the noncontrolling interest was adjusted of 39.4 million was recognized in equity attributable to the Company. 
 Related Party Vendor Purchases - A contract manufacturer used by BOA as the primary supplier of molded injection parts is a noncontrolling shareholder of BOA. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and for the period from October 16, 2020 (date of acquisition) through December 31, 2020, BOA purchased approximate ly 56.1 million, 48.3 million and 6.7 million, respectively, from this supplier. 
 Ergobaby 
 Recapitalization - In February 2022, the Company completed a recapitalization of Ergobaby whereby the LLC entered into an amendment to the intercompany loan agreement with Ergobaby (the "Ergo Loan Agreement"). The Ergo Loan Agreement was amended to provide for additional loan borrowings of 61.5 million to fund a distribution to shareholders. The LLC owned 81.6 of the outstanding shares of Ergobaby on the date of the distribution and received 50.2 million. The remaining amount of the distribution was paid to minority shareholders. 
 Advanced Circuits 
 Recapitalization - In November 2020, the Company completed a recapitalization of ACI whereby the Company entered into an amendment to the intercompany loan agreement with ACI (the "ACI Loan Agreement"). The ACI Loan Agreement was amended to (i) provide for term loan borrowings of 48.8 million to fund the repurchase of shares from an existing shareholder and to fund a distribution to shareholders, and ii) extend the maturity dates of the term loans, and termination date of the revolving loan commitment. In connection with the recapitalization, ACI repurchased 47,870 shares of ACI capital stock, and distributed 42.8 million to shareholders. The Company owned 71.8 of the outstanding shares of ACI on the date of the distribution and received 30.7 million. The remaining amount of the distribution was paid to minority shareholders. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates and judgments may involve varying degrees of uncertainty. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and changes in other facts and circumstances, and potentially could result in materially different results. Our critical accounting estimates are discussed below. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those policies discussed below, refer to " Note B - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies " to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Business Combinations 
 The acquisitions of our businesses are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Accounting for business combinations requires the use of estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to allocate the purchase price. The estimates of fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable using established valuation methods, taking into consideration information supplied by the management of the acquired entities and other relevant information. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's 
 137 

judgment and often involves the use of assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, royalty rates, customer attrition rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. The determination of fair values requires significant judgment both by our management team and, when appropriate, valuations by independent third-party appraisers. We amortize intangible assets, such as trademarks and customer relationships, as well as property, plant and equipment, over their economic useful lives, unless those lives are indefinite. We consider factors such as historical information, our plans for the asset and similar assets held by our previously acquired businesses. The impact could result in either higher or lower amortization and/or depreciation expense. 
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
 Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets 
 Goodwill represents the excess amount of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names with a carrying value of approximately 57.0 million. Our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis as of March 31 st , and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. Each of our businesses represents a reporting unit. 
 We use a qualitative approach to test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative goodwill impairment testing. The qualitative factors we consider include, in part, the general macroeconomic environment, industry and market specific conditions for each reporting unit, financial performance including actual versus planned results and results of relevant prior periods, operating costs and cost impacts, as well as issues or events specific to the reporting unit. If qualitative factors are not sufficient to determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to exceed its carrying value, we will perform a quantitative test at the reporting unit whereby we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach or market approach, or a weighting of the two methods. Under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit based on the present value of future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on Management's estimate of revenue growth rates and operating margins and take into consideration industry and market conditions as well as company specific economic factors. The discount rate used is based on the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with the business and the uncertainty associated with the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable public companies with operating characteristics that are similar to the reporting unit. When market comparables are not meaningful or available, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using only the income approach. The determination of fair value involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, operating margins, working capital requirements, capital expenditures and terminal growth rates and actual results could differ from these estimates. Future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions and result in changes to our estimates. 
 2022 Interim goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing 
 As a result of operating results below forecasts in the current peri od and expectations that macroeconomic conditions and decreases in consumer discretionary spending in the upcoming year will impact 2023 operating results, we determined that a triggering event had occurred at Ergobaby in the fourth quarter of 2022 and performed an interim impairment test of the Ergobaby goodwill and indefinite-lived tradename as of December 31, 2022. The Company used an income approach for the impairment test, whereby the Company estimated the fair value of the reporting unit ba sed on the present value of expected future cash flows, including terminal value, and utilized a discount ra te of 16.0 . The prospective financial information considers reporting unit specific facts and circumstances and was our best estimate of operational results and cash flows for Ergobaby as of the date of our impairment testing. The results of the quantitative impairment testing indicated that the fair value of the Ergobaby reporting unit did not exceed the carrying value. We recorded goodwill impairment expense of 20.6 million at December 31, 2022. For the indefinite lived tradename, the results of the quantitative testing indicated that the fair value exceeded the carrying value. 
 Annual goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing 
 2022 An nual Impairment Testing - For our annual impairment testing at March 31, 2022, we performed a qualitative assessment of our reporting units. The results of the qualitative analysis indicated that it was more-likely-than-not that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value. 
 138 

2021 Annual Impairment Testing - For our annual impairment testing at March 31, 2021, we performed a qualitative assessment of our reporting units. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we also considered how we expected COVID-19 to impact future operating results and short and long term financial condition as part of our qualitative assessment, including the effects on our end customers, potential short-term supply chain constraints, and the continued restrictions imposed by government and regulatory authorities. The results of the qualitative analysis indicated that it was more-likely-than-not that the fair value of each of our reporting units except Arnold exceeded their carrying value. Based on our analysis, we determined that the Arnold operating segment required quantitative testing because we could not conclude that the fair value of this reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value based on qualitative factors alone. 
 We performed the quantitative tests of Arnold using an income approach to determine the fair value of the reporting units. We do not believe that the market approach results in relevant data points for market multiples or data from comparable companies since most of Arnold's competitors are privately held and do not publish data that can be used in an income approach. In developing the prospective financial information used in the income approach, we considered recent market conditions, taking into consideration the uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic fallout. The prospective financial information considered reporting unit specific facts and circumstances and was our best estimate of operational results and cash flows for the Arnold reporting unit as of the date of our impairment testing. The discount rate used in the income approach was 13.0 , and th e results of the quantitative impairment testing indicated that the fair value of the Arnold reporting unit exceeded the carrying value b y approximately 272 . Th e prospective financial information that was used to determine the fair values of the Arnold reporting unit required us to make assumptions regarding future operational results including revenue growth rates and gross margins. 
 2020 Annual Impairment Testing - For our annual impairment testing at March 31, 2020, we performed a qualitative assessment of our reporting units. As part of the analysis, we considered how we expected the COVID-19 pandemic to impact our future operating results and short and long-term financial condition. In addition to the typical qualitative factors we consider as part of the assessment, we went through a process with each of our reporting units whereby we considered various scenarios for the remainder of the year, probability weighted for what we consider the most likely outcome given existing facts and circumstances. This process included consideration of the reporting unit's industry and customers, including customer liquidity, operational capacity given local government restrictions imposed to prevent spread of the COVID-19 virus, supply chain constraints that may exist as a result of the virus and ability of the subsidiary to reduce cash outflows. The results of the qualitative analysis indicated that it was more-likely-than-not that the fair value of our 5.11, ACI, Arnold, Liberty and Sterno reporting units exceeded their carrying value. Based on our analysis, we determined that our Ergobaby, Altor and Velocity operating segments required quantitative testing because we could not conclude that the fair value of these reporting units significantly exceeded the carrying value based on qualitative factors alone. 
 We performed the quantitative tests of Ergobaby, Altor and Velocity using an income approach to determine the fair value of the reporting units. We were unable to use a market approach due to the existing market conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in significant volatility and lack of available market comparables. In developing the prospective financial information used in the income approach, we considered recent market conditions, taking into consideration the uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic fallout. The prospective financial information considers reporting unit specific facts and circumstances and was our best estimate of operational results and cash flows for each reporting unit as of the date of our impairment testing. For Ergobaby, the discount rate used in the income approach was 15.9 and the results of the quantitative impairment testing indicated that the fair value of the Ergobaby reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by 14.0 . For Altor, the discount rate used in the income approach was 13.3 , and the results of the quantitative impairment testing indicated that the fair value of the Altor reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by 3.8 . The impairment test for Velocity used a discount rate of 12.8 in the income approach, and the results of the quantitative impairment testing indicated that the fair value of the Velocity reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by 16.4 . The prospective financial information that is used to determine the fair values of the reporting units requires us to make assumptions regarding future operational results including revenue growth rates and gross margins. If we do not achieve the forecasted revenue growth rates and gross margins, the results of the quantitative testing could change, potentially leading to additional testing and impairment at the reporting units that were tested quantitatively.

Definite-Lived Intangible Assets 
 Long-lived intangible assets subject to amortization, including customer relationships, non-compete agreements, permits and technology are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets, which we determine based on the consideration of several factors including the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service. We evaluate long-lived assets for potential impairment whenever events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and is greater than its fair value, the asset is impaired and an impairment loss must be recognized. 
 The determination of fair values and estimated useful lives requires significant judgment both by our management team and by outside experts engaged to assist in this process. This judgment could result in either a higher or lower value assigned to our reporting units and intangible assets. The impact could result in either higher or lower amortization and/or the incurrence of an impairment charge. 
 Allocation Interests 
 At the time of our Initial Public Offering, we issued Allocation Interests governed by our LLC agreement that entitle the holders (the "Holders") to receive distributions pursuant to a profit allocation formula upon the occurrence of certain events. The Holders are entitled to receive and as such can elect to receive the positive contribution based profit allocation payment for each of the business acquisitions during the 30-day period following the fifth anniversary of the date upon which we acquired a controlling interest in that business (a "Holding Event") and upon the sale of that business (a "Sale Event").

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 At December 31, 2022, our debt includes both fixed rate and variable rate instruments. We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through borrowings under our 2022 Credit Facility because borrowings under this agreement are subject to variable interest rates based on SOFR. We had 395 million outstanding under the 2022 Term Loan and 155 million outstanding under our 2022 Revolving Credit Facility at December 31, 2022 for a total of 550 million in outstanding debt subject to variable interest rates at December 31, 2022. 
 The one-month SOFR was approximately 436 basis points at December 31, 2022, and the three-month SOFR was approximately 459 basis points at December 31, 2022. We currently estimate that a 100 basis point increase in SOFR would not have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 
 We expect to have additional borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility in the future in order to finance our short term working capital needs and future acquisitions. These borrowings will be subject to variable interest rates. 
 Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity 
 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business at certain of our subsidiaries, such as sales to third party customers, foreign plant operations, and purchases from suppliers. 
 Credit Risk 
 We are exposed to credit risk associated with cash equivalents, investments, and trade receivables. We do not believe that our cash equivalents or investments present significant credit risks because the counterparties to the instruments consist of major financial institutions and we manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty. Our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022 consists principally of (i) treasury backed securities, (ii) insured prime money market funds, and (iii) cash balances in several non-interest bearing checking accounts. Substantially all trade receivable balances of our businesses are unsecured. The concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited by the large number of customers in our customer base and their dispersion across various industries and geographic areas. Although we have a large number of customers who are dispersed across different industries and geographic areas, a prolonged economic downturn could increase our exposure to credit risk on our trade receivables. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 Board of Directors and Stockholders 
 Compass Diversified Holdings 
 Opinion on internal control over financial reporting 
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Compass Diversified Holdings (a Delaware trust) and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by COSO. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, and our report dated March 1, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 
 Basis for opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management s Report ). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Our audit of, and opinion on, the Company s internal control over financial reporting does not include the internal control over financial reporting of PrimaLoft Technologies Holdings, Inc. PrimaLoft ), a majority-owned subsidiary, whose financial statements reflect total assets and net revenues constituting 16 and 1 , respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. As indicated in Management s Report, PrimaLoft was acquired during 2022. Management s assertion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting excluded internal control over financial reporting of PrimaLoft. 
 Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may 
 F-2 

become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 Board of Directors and Stockholders 
 Compass Diversified Holdings 
 Opinion on the financial statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Compass Diversified Holdings (a Delaware trust) and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule included under Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ), and our report dated March 1, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion. 
 Basis for opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical audit matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Acquisition of PrimaLoft Technologies Holdings, Inc. PrimaLoft - Fair Value of Intangible Assets Acquired 
 As described further in note C to the financial statements, the Company completed the acquisition of PrimaLoft on July 12, 2022, for consideration of approximately 541.1 million. The identifiable intangible assets acquired include customer relationships, a tradename, and technology, which have been recorded by management at their acquisition date fair values of 209.1 million, 48.2 million, and 49.1 million, respectively. We identified the valuation of the intangible assets acquired in the PrimaLoft acquisition as a critical audit matter. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that the valuation of the acquired customer relationships, tradename, and technology is a critical audit matter are that the determination of the fair values of such assets required management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues and operating 
 F-4 

margins as well as the discount rates used. This required a high degree of auditor judgement and an increased extent of effort, including professionals with specialized skill and knowledge, in auditing these assumptions made by management. 
 Our audit procedures related to the valuation of the acquired customer relationships, tradename and technology included the following procedures, among others : 
 We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to the determination of fair values of the customer relationships, tradename, and technology including controls over the development of revenue growth rate, operating margin and discount rate assumptions, as well as the controls around the appropriateness of the valuation models used. 
 We evaluated the valuation methodologies and discount rates utilized by management with the assistance of our valuation professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 We tested the forecasted revenues and operating margins by assessing the reasonableness of management s forecasts compared to historical results and forecasted market and industry trends. 
 Goodwill Ergobaby reporting unit 
 As described further in note H to the financial statements, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2022 on its Ergobaby reporting unit. This reporting unit had goodwill totaling 61.4 million prior to impairment. We identified the Company s quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for the Ergobaby reporting unit as a critical audit matter. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that the quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for the Ergobaby reporting unit is a critical audit matter are that the determination of the reporting unit s fair value required management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues and operating margins as well as the discount rate used. This required a high degree of auditor judgement and an increased extent of effort, including professionals with specialized skill and knowledge, in auditing these assumptions made by management. 
 Our audit procedures related to the quantitative impairment testing of the Ergobaby reporting unit included the following procedures, among others: 
 We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to the determination of the reporting unit s fair value, including controls over the development of revenue growth rate, operating margin and discount rate assumptions, as well as the appropriateness of the valuation models used. 
 We evaluated management s historical ability to forecast revenue and operating margins and compared those assumptions to (1) historical results, (2) management s business plans, and (3) forecasted information in industry reports and companies in their respective peer group. 
 With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we assessed the valuation methodologies utilized by management. 
 We performed sensitivity analyses on the revenue, operating margin, and discount rate assumptions used to evaluate the impact changes in these assumptions have on management s conclusion.

million. This deferred tax asset is net of million of valuation allowance primarily associated with the realization of domestic and foreign net operating losses, domestic and foreign tax credits and the limitation on the deduction of interest expense. These deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of reserves not currently deductible for tax purposes. The temporary differences that have resulted in the recording of these tax assets may be used to offset taxable income in future periods, reducing the amount of taxes required to be paid. Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income at those subsidiaries with deferred tax assets. Based upon the expected future results of operations, the Company believes it is more likely than not that those subsidiaries with deferred tax assets will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit of existing temporary differences, although there can be no assurance of this. The impact of not realizing these deferred tax assets would result in an increase in income tax expense for such period when the determination was made that the assets are not realizable.

A significant portion of the balance in deferred tax liabilities reflects temporary differences in the basis of property and equipment and intangible assets related to the Company s purchase accounting adjustments in connection with the acquisition of certain of its businesses.

 The calculated amount of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the table above are impacted by the length of the lease term and discount rate used to present value the minimum lease payments. The Company's lease agreements often include one or more options to renew at the company's discretion. In general, it is not reasonably certain that lease renewals will be exercised at lease commencement and therefore lease renewals are not included in the lease term. As the discount rate is rarely determinable, the Company utilizes the incremental borrowing rate of the subsidiary entering into the lease arrangement, on a collateralized basis, over a similar term as adjusted for any country specific risk.
