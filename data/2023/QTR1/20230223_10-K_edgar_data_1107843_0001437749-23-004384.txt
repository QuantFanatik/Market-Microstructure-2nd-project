RISK FACTOR SUMMARY 
 
 Our business is subject to significant risks and uncertainties that make an investment in us speculative and risky. Below we summarize what we believe are the principal risk factors but these risks are not the only ones we face, and you should carefully review and consider the full discussion of our risk factors in the section titled Risk Factors, together with the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occurs (or if any of those listed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K occur), our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, revenue, and future prospects could be seriously harmed. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. 

Our quarterly and annual operating results may vary from period to period, which could result in our failure to meet expectations with respect to operating results and cause the trading price of our stock to decline. 

If we do not successfully anticipate market needs and opportunities or are unable to enhance our solutions and develop new solutions that meet those needs and opportunities on a timely or cost-effective basis, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business and financial condition may be harmed. 

If we fail to continue to effectively scale and adapt our platform to meet the performance and other requirements of our customers, our operating results and our business would be harmed. 

If we are unable to renew existing subscriptions for our IT, security and compliance solutions, sell additional subscriptions for our solutions and attract new customers, our operating results would be harmed. 

Our current research and development efforts may not produce successful products or enhancements to our platform that result in significant revenue, cost savings or other benefits in the near future. 

Our platform, website and internal systems may be subject to intentional disruption or other security incidents that could result in liability and adversely impact our reputation and future sales. 

Our sales cycle can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. As a result, revenues may vary from period to period, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate and could harm our business. 

Adverse economic conditions or reduced IT spending may adversely impact our business. 

Our IT, security and compliance solutions are delivered from 11 shared cloud platforms, and any disruption of service at these facilities would interrupt or delay our ability to deliver our solutions to our customers which could reduce our revenues and harm our operating results. 

We face competition in our markets, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position. 

If our solutions fail to detect vulnerabilities or incorrectly detect vulnerabilities, our brand and reputation could be harmed, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

If we are unable to continue the expansion of our sales force, sales of our solutions and the growth of our business would be harmed. 

We rely on third-party channel partners to generate a substantial amount of our revenues, and if we fail to expand and manage our distribution channels, our revenues could decline and our growth prospects could suffer. 

A significant portion of our customers, channel partners and employees are located outside of the United States, which subjects us to a number of risks associated with conducting international operations, and if we are unable to successfully manage these risks, our business and operating results could be harmed. 

If the market for cloud solutions for IT, security and compliance does not evolve as we anticipate, our revenues may not grow and our operating results would be harmed. 

Our business and operations have continued to grow since inception, and if we do not appropriately manage any future growth, or are unable to improve our systems and processes, our operating results may be negatively affected. 

A portion of our revenues are generated by sales to government entities, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks. 

Undetected software errors or flaws in our solutions could harm our reputation, decrease market acceptance of our solutions or result in liability. 

Our solutions could be used to collect and store personal information of our customers employees or customers, and therefore privacy and other data handling concerns could result in additional cost and liability to us or inhibit sales of our solutions. 

Our solutions contain third-party open source software components, and our failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our solutions. 

We use third-party software and data that may be difficult to replace or cause errors or failures of our solutions that could lead to lost customers or harm to our reputation and our operating results. 

Failure to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business and operating results. 

Assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and harm our business and operating results.

PART I 

Item 1. 
 Business 

Overview 
 
 We are a pioneer and leading provider of a cloud-based platform delivering information technology (IT), security and compliance solutions. Our integrated suite of IT, security and compliance solutions delivered on our Qualys Cloud Platform enables our customers to: 1) identify and manage their IT assets across on-premises, endpoints, cloud, containers, and mobile environments; 2) collect and analyze large amounts of IT security data; 3) discover and prioritize vulnerabilities; 4) recommend and implement remediation actions; and 5) verify the implementation of such actions. This helps organizations protect their systems and applications from ever-evolving cyber-attacks and helps achieve compliance with internal policies and external regulations. 
 
 Our cloud solutions address the growing IT, security and compliance complexities and risks that are amplified by the dissolving boundaries between internal and external IT infrastructures and web environments, the rapid adoption of cloud computing, containers and serverless IT models, and the proliferation of geographically dispersed IT assets. Organizations use our integrated suite of solutions to cost-effectively obtain a unified view of their IT asset inventory as well as security and compliance posture across globally-distributed IT infrastructures as our solution offers a single platform for information technology, information security, application security, endpoint, developer security and cloud teams. 
 
 IT infrastructures are more complex and globally-distributed today than ever before, as organizations of all sizes increasingly rely upon a myriad of interconnected information systems and related IT assets, such as servers, databases, web applications, routers, switches, desktops, laptops, other physical and virtual infrastructure, and numerous external networks and cloud services. In this environment, new and evolving digital technologies intended to improve organizations operations can also increase vulnerability to cyber-attacks, which can expose sensitive data, damage IT and physical infrastructures, and result in serious financial or reputational consequences. In addition, the rapidly increasing amount of data and devices in IT environments makes it more difficult to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in a timely manner. The predominant approach to IT security has been to implement multiple disparate security products that can be costly and difficult to deploy, integrate and manage and may not adequately protect organizations. As a result, we believe there is a large and growing opportunity for comprehensive cloud-based IT, security and compliance solutions delivered in a single platform. 
 
 We designed our Qualys Cloud Platform to transform the way organizations secure and protect their IT infrastructures and applications. Our cloud platform offers an integrated suite of solutions that automates the lifecycle of asset discovery and management, security assessments, and compliance management for an organization s IT infrastructure and assets, whether such infrastructure and assets reside inside the organization, on their network perimeter, on endpoints or in the cloud. Since inception, our solutions have been designed to be delivered through the cloud and to be easily and rapidly deployed on a global scale, enabling faster implementation and lower total cost of ownership than traditional on-premises enterprise software products. Our customers, ranging from some of the largest global organizations to small businesses, are served from our globally-distributed cloud platform, enabling us to rapidly deliver new solutions, enhancements and security updates. 
 
 We believe that our cloud platform provides our customers with unique advantages, including: 

No hardware to buy or manage. There is no infrastructure or software to buy and maintain thus reducing our customers operating costs; all services are accessible in the cloud via web interface. Qualys operates and maintains the platform. 

Real-time visibility in one place, anytime and anywhere . Our customers can conveniently see their security and compliance posture across their global IT asset inventory in one browser window, without plugins or a virtual private network (VPN), whenever and wherever Internet access is available. 

Easy global scanning. Our customers can easily perform scans on geographically distributed and segmented networks at the perimeter, behind the firewall, on dynamic cloud environments and on endpoints. 

Seamless scaling. Our cloud platform is a scalable, comprehensive, and end-to-end solution for the IT, security and compliance needs of our customers. Our customers can seamlessly add new coverage, users and services after they have deployed our platform. 

Up to date resources . Qualys has one of the largest knowledge bases of vulnerability signatures in the industry. All security updates are made in real-time. 

Data stored securely . Data is securely stored and processed in a multi-tiered architecture of load-balanced servers. Our encrypted databases are physically and logically secured.

Table of Contents 

We were founded and incorporated in December 1999 with a vision of transforming the way organizations secure and protect their IT infrastructure and applications and initially launched our first cloud solution, Vulnerability Management (VM), in 2000. As VM gained acceptance, we introduced additional solutions to help customers manage increasing IT, security and compliance requirements. Today, the suite of solutions that we offer on our cloud platform and refer to as the Qualys Cloud Apps helps our customers protect a range of assets across on-premises, endpoints, cloud, containers, and mobile environments. These Cloud Apps address and include: 

IT Security: Vulnerability Management (VM), Vulnerability Management, Detection and Response (VMDR), Threat Protection (TP), Continuous Monitoring (CM), Patch Management (PM), Multi-Vector Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), Certificate Assessment (CRA), SaaS Detection and Response (SaaSDR), Secure Enterprise Mobility (SEM), Custom Assessment and Remediation (CAR), Context Extended Detection and Response (XDR), Network Detection and Response (NDR); 

Compliance: Policy Compliance (PC), Security Configuration Assessment (SCA), PCI Compliance (PCI), File Integrity Monitoring (FIM), Security Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ), Out of-Band Configuration Assessment (OCA); 

Web Application Security: Web Application Scanning (WAS), Web Application Firewall (WAF); 

Asset Management: Global AssetView (GAV), Cybersecurity Asset Management (CSAM), Certificate Inventory (CRI); and 

Cloud/Container Security: Cloud Inventory (CI), Cloud Security Assessment (CSA), Container Security (CS). 

We provide our solutions through a software-as-a-service model, primarily with renewable annual subscriptions. These subscriptions require customers to pay a fee in order to access each of our cloud solutions. We generally invoice our customers for the entire subscription amount at the start of the subscription term, and the invoiced amounts are treated as deferred revenues and are recognized ratably over the term of each subscription. We continue to experience revenue growth from our existing customers as they renew and purchase additional subscriptions, as well as from the addition of new customers to our cloud platform. 
 
 Our Qualys Cloud Platform is currently used by over 10,000 customers worldwide, including a majority of each of the Forbes Global 100 and Fortune 100. Our revenues increased to 489.7 million in 2022 from 411.2 million in 2021 and 363.0 million in 2020 . 
 
 Our Platform 
 
 Our cloud platform consists of a suite of IT security, compliance, web application security, asset management and cloud and container security solutions, which we refer to as the Qualys Cloud Apps, that leverages our shared and extensible core services and our highly scalable multi-tenant cloud infrastructure. We also provide open application program interfaces, or APIs, and other developer tools that allow third parties to embed our technology into their solutions and build applications on our cloud platform. 
 
 Our cloud platform utilizes physical and virtual sensors, and cloud agents that provide our customers with continuous visibility enabling customers to respond to threats immediately. Customers can extend visibility to all known IT infrastructure using our Out-of-Band Configuration Assessment sensor for systems that are air-gapped or otherwise difficult to assess. 
 
 The Qualys Cloud Platform automatically gathers and analyzes security and compliance data in a scalable, state-of-the-art backend. The technology underlying our cloud infrastructure enables us to ingest, process, analyze and store a high volume of sensor data coming from our agents, scanners and passive analyzers, and correlate information at very high speeds in a distributed manner for millions of devices.

Our cloud platform is delivered to our customers via our 11 global shared cloud platforms, or via our private platform offering, Qualys Private Cloud Platform (PCP), for customers or partners that want the platform to reside within the customer's shared cloud platform. The PCP is a standalone version of our multi-layer, multi-tenant services architecture and is a fully integrated turnkey solution, making it more scalable, cost effective and faster to deploy within a customer's shared cloud platform. Solutions delivered through our PCP are typically on the same subscription basis as solutions delivered through our shared platform. Our PCP utilizes hardware and software owned by us and is physically located on the customer's premises. The customer is not permitted to take possession of the software or access the software code. We also offer our PCP as a subscription-based platform services to the customer using a virtual version of our software. This virtualized PCP allows us to extend our security and compliance solutions without the complexity and cost associated with deploying traditional enterprise software. We also offer Private Cloud Platform Appliance (PCPA), an on-premises IT, security and compliance solution packaged in a form-factor for medium-sized companies. 
 
 Qualys Core Services 
 
 Our core services enable integrated workflows, management and real-time analysis and reporting across all of our IT, security and compliance solutions for our customers inside their organizations, on the perimeter, on endpoints or in the cloud. 
 
 Our core services constitute dynamic and customizable dashboards and centrally managed, self-updating integrated Cloud Apps, through a natively integrated unified platform. Our interactive, dynamic dashboards and cloud platform allow our customers to aggregate and correlate all of their IT, security and compliance data in one place, drill down into details, and generate reports customized for different audiences. Our cloud platform s powerful Elasticsearch clusters enable customers to instantly find detailed data on any asset.

Table of Contents 

Our core services include: 

Asset Tagging and Management. Enables customers to easily identify, categorize and manage large numbers of assets in highly dynamic IT environments and automates the process of inventory management and hierarchical organization of IT assets. Built on top of this core service is the Qualys GAV framework, which is a global asset inventory service enabling our customers to search for information on any IT asset, scaling to millions of assets for customers of all sizes, helping IT and security personnel to search IT assets and maintain an up-to-date inventory on a continuous basis. 

Reporting and Dashboards. A highly configurable reporting engine that provides customers with reports and dashboards based on their roles and access privileges. 

Questionnaires and Collaboration. A configurable workflow engine that enables customers to easily build questionnaires and capture existing business processes and workflows to evaluate controls and gather evidence to validate and document compliance. 

Remediation and Workflow. An integrated workflow engine that allows customers to automatically generate helpdesk tickets for remediation and to manage compliance exceptions based on customer-defined policies, enabling subsequent review, commentary, tracking and escalation. This engine automatically distributes remediation tasks to IT administrators upon scan completion, tracks remediation progress and closes open tickets once patches are applied and remediation is verified in subsequent scans. 

Big Data Correlation and Analytics Engine. Provides Elasticsearch capabilities for indexing, searching and correlating large amounts of security and compliance data with other security incidents and third-party security intelligence data. Embedded workflows enable customers to quickly assess risk and access information for remediation, incident analysis and forensic investigations. 

Alerts and Notifications. Creates email notifications to alert customers of new vulnerabilities, malware infections, scan completion, open trouble tickets and system updates. 

Qualys Cloud Apps 
 
 Many organizations have an array of heterogeneous point tools that do not interoperate well and are difficult and costly to maintain and integrate, making it difficult for Chief Information Officers (CIOs) and Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) to obtain a single, unified view of their organization s security and compliance posture. The Qualys Cloud Platform and its Cloud Apps help organizations escape this tool-fragmentation dilemma by drastically simplifying their security stacks and regaining unimpeded visibility across their IT environment. 
 
 The Cloud Apps are self-updating, centrally managed and tightly integrated, and cover a broad range of functionality in areas such as IT security, compliance, web application security, asset management and cloud and container security solutions. 
 
 From inception through December 31, 2021, we have added the following Cloud Apps: VM, PC, PCI, WAS, WAF, CM, SAQ, TP, FIM, GAV, SCA, CS, CI, CSA, CRI, CRA, OCA, PM, VMDR, EDR, SaaSDR, SEM, and CSAM. In 2022, we introduced CAR, XDR and NDR. 
 
 We believe that our applications are easy to use and provide our customers with a high level of control because our applications are part of one platform, share a common user interface, utilize the same scanners and agents, access the same collected data, and leverage the same user permissions. 
 
 Our customers can subscribe to one or more of our IT, security and compliance Apps based on their initial needs and expand their subscriptions over time to new areas within their organization or to additional Qualys solutions. For VMDR, we offer four editions of our Qualys Cloud App: Enterprise for large enterprises, Express for medium-sized businesses, Express Lite for small-sized businesses, and Scan-on-Behalf for Scan-on-Behalf customers. For all other Qualys Cloud Apps, we offer four editions: Enterprise for large enterprises, Express for medium-sized businesses, Express Lite for small-sized businesses, and Consulting Edition for consultants, consulting organizations and Managed Service Providers (MSPs). 
 
 Many of our customers use multiple Cloud Apps to develop a more complete understanding of their respective environment s IT, security and compliance posture. The Qualys Cloud Platform currently provides the following Cloud Apps to our customers:

IT Security 
 
 Vulnerability Management (VM): VM is an industry leading and award-winning solution that automates network auditing and vulnerability management across an organization, including network discovery and mapping, asset management, vulnerability reporting and remediation tracking. Driven by our comprehensive knowledge base of known vulnerabilities, VM enables cost-effective protection against vulnerabilities without substantial resource deployment. 
 
 Vulnerability Management, Detection and Response (VMDR): VMDR enables organizations to automatically discover every asset in their environment, including unmanaged assets appearing on the network, inventory all hardware and software, and classify and tag critical assets. VMDR continuously assesses these assets for the latest vulnerabilities and applies the latest threat intel analysis to prioritize actively exploitable vulnerabilities. VMDR automatically detects the latest superseding patch for the vulnerable asset and easily deploys it for remediation. Finally, VMDR quantifies risk across vulnerabilities, assets and groups of assets helping organizations proactively reduce cyber risk exposure and track cyber risk reduction over time. By delivering all this in a single app workflow, VMDR automates the entire process and significantly accelerates an organization s ability to respond to threats, thus preventing possible exploitation. 
 
 Threat Protection (TP): Thousands of new vulnerabilities are disclosed annually. With TP, customers can pinpoint their most critical threats and identify what they need to remediate first. TP continuously correlates external threat information against a customer's vulnerabilities and IT asset inventory, so customers know which threats pose the greatest risk to their organization at any given time. As Qualys engineers continuously validate and rate new threats from internal and external sources, TP s live feed displays the latest vulnerability disclosures and maps them to customers impacted IT assets. Customers can see the assets affected by each threat, and drill down into details. 
 
 Continuous Monitoring (CM): Built on top of VM, CM is a next-generation cloud service that can detect network threats and unexpected changes before they turn into breaches. Whenever CM spots an anomaly in a network, it immediately sends targeted, informative alerts to the right people for each situation and each machine. CM tracks what happens throughout public perimeters, internal networks, and cloud environments - anywhere in the world. 
 
 Patch Management (PM): PM provides automated patch deployment capabilities for Windows, Linux, Mac and third party software by correlating vulnerabilities and the right set of remediation including patches and configuration fixes. It continuously gathers and uploads telemetry about installed software, open vulnerabilities and missing patches to the Qualys Cloud Platform. The resulting shared visibility of assets and their posture enables IT and security teams to collaborate using common vulnerability-centric terminology and provides a consistent data set to analyze, prioritize, deploy and verify patches more efficiently. 
 
 Multi-Vector Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR): Traditional endpoint detection and response solutions focus only on endpoint activity to detect attacks. As a result, they lack the full context to analyze attacks accurately. This leads to an incomplete picture and a high rate of false positives and negatives, requiring organizations to use multiple point solutions and large incident response teams. Qualys fills the gaps by bringing a new multi-vector approach and the unifying power of its highly scalable Cloud Platform to EDR, providing vital context and comprehensive visibility to the entire attack chain, from prevention to detection to response. EDR unifies different context vectors like asset discovery, rich normalized software inventory, end-of-life visibility, vulnerabilities and exploits, misconfigurations, in-depth endpoint telemetry, and network reachability with a powerful backend to correlate it all for accurate assessment, detection and response. 
 
 Certificate Assessment (CRA): CRA assesses digital certificates and Transport Layer Security (TLS) configurations. CRA generates certificate instance grades using a straightforward methodology that allows administrators to assess often overlooked server SSL/TLS configurations without having to become SSL experts. It also identifies out-of-policy certificates with weak signatures or key length and shows how many unique Certificate Authorities were found in the environment and how many certificates each one issued. 
 
 SaaS Detection and Response (SaaSDR): SaaSDR leverages the Qualys Cloud platform to provide continuous visibility into SaaS applications such as Office 365, Salesforce and Zoom for configuration posture management, activity monitoring and data security insights. 
 
 Secure Enterprise Mobility (SEM): SEM extends the power of VMDR for in-depth inventory of mobile devices and their data, real time vulnerability and misconfiguration detection, and built-in remediation with patch orchestration for all Android and iOS/iPadOS devices across the enterprise. 
 
 Custom Assessment and Remediation (CAR): Custom Assessment and Remediation opens the Qualys Cloud Platform for security architects allowing the creation of custom scripts in popular scripting languages, user-defined controls and automation, all seamlessly integrated within existing programs to quickly assess, respond to and remediate threats across global hybrid environments. 
 
 Context Extended Detection and Response (XDR): XDR provides context and clarity to enterprise security operations through risk-focused, single pane of glass visibility and control to improve enterprise-wide threat detection and incident response. It leverages the Cloud Platform's response capabilities - patching, fixing misconfigurations, killing processes and network connections, and quarantining hosts - to comprehensively remediate cyber security threats identified by Qualys XDR. 
 
 Network Detection and Response (NDR): Network detection and response monitors network traffic and analyzes it using deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) to detect cyber threats in data centers and in the public cloud. The solution is able to detect both known and publicly undisclosed threats in real time. 

Compliance 
 
 Policy Compliance (PC): PC performs automated security configuration assessments on IT systems throughout a network, helping to reduce risk and continuously ensure compliance with internal policies and external regulations. PC leverages out-of-the-box library content to fast-track compliance assessments using industry-recommended best practices. PC also provides a centralized, interactive console for specifying baseline standards for different hosts. By automating requirement evaluation against multiple standards for operating systems, network devices, databases and server applications, PC enables the quick identification of security issues and works to prevent configuration drift. PC works to prioritize and track remediation and exceptions, while demonstrating a repeatable auditable process for compliance management. 
 
 Security Configuration Assessment (SCA): SCA provides automatic assessment of IT assets configurations using the latest Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks for operating systems, databases, applications and network devices. SCA provides intuitive workflows for assessing, monitoring, reporting and remediating security-related configuration issues. SCA s CIS assessments are provided via a web-based user interface and delivered from the Qualys Cloud Platform, enabling centralized management with minimal deployment overhead. SCA users can automatically create downloadable reports and view dashboards.

PCI Compliance (PCI): PCI streamlines and automates compliance with PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) requirements for protecting the collection, storage, processing and transmission of cardholder data. As an Approved Scanning Vendor, Qualys has been authorized by the PCI Security Standards Council to conduct the required quarterly scans. PCI scans all Internet-facing networks and systems with Six Sigma (99.9996 accuracy, generates reports and provides detailed patching instructions. An auto-submission feature completes the compliance process once remediation is completed. 
 
 File Integrity Monitoring (FIM): FIM logs and centrally tracks file change events on common enterprise operating systems in organizations of all sizes. FIM provides customers with a simple way to achieve centralized cloud-based visibility of activity resulting from normal patching and administrative tasks, change control exceptions or violations, or malicious activity - then reports on that system activity as part of compliance mandates. FIM collects the critical details needed to quickly identify changes and root out activity that violates policy or is potentially malicious. FIM helps customers to comply with change control policy enforcement and change monitoring requirements. 
 
 Security Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ): SAQ automates and streamlines third-party and internal risk assessment processes, obviating the need to perform such processes manually via email and spreadsheets. SAQ easily designs surveys to assess procedural controls of IT and security policies and practices. SAQ automates the launch and monitoring of assessment campaigns, making the process agile, accurate, comprehensive, centralized, scalable and uniform across an organization. SAQ also provides tools for displaying, analyzing and acting on collected data, enabling the assessment of compliance with industry standards, regulations and internal policies of third parties, like vendors and partners, and of employees. 
 
 Out-of-Band Configuration Assessment (OCA): The OCA sensor and Cloud App allows customers to achieve complete visibility of all known IT infrastructure by pushing vulnerability and configuration data to the Qualys Cloud Platform from systems that are otherwise difficult to assess, such as highly locked-down systems, systems on disconnected or air gap networks, or in environments that are highly sensitive to scans. OCA s expanded data collection approach significantly broadens the types of technologies supported by the Qualys Cloud Platform and provides deeper assessment of configuration so that customers have better visibility into potentially critical vulnerabilities and misconfigurations across their entire environment. 
 
 Web Application Security 
 
 Web Application Scanning (WAS): WAS continuously discovers and catalogs web applications including new and unknown ones and detects vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in web apps and APIs. Scaling to thousands of scans, it conducts incisive, thorough and precise testing of browser-based web apps, mobile app backends, and Internet of things (IoT) services. Its seamless integration with the Qualys Web Application Firewall (WAF) enables verification of attack protection, ticket creation and one click mitigation of vulnerabilities. WAS' powerful API enables integration with other systems and allows teams to detect issues within DevOps environments early in the application development process. Bundled malware detection capability with WAS uses reputational, behavioral, antivirus, and heuristic analyses to identify and alert on malware infecting a user's websites. By Integrating WAS with manual testing tools and bug bounty solutions, customers can build a comprehensive web application vulnerability testing program. 
 
 Web Application Firewall (WAF): WAF permits the reduction of application security cost and complexity with a unified platform to prevent any attempt to exploit vulnerabilities. Simple, scalable and adaptive, WAF enables the quick blocking of attacks, prevents disclosure of sensitive information, and controls when and where customer applications are accessed. WAF and WAS work together seamlessly. Customers scan web apps with WAS, deploy one-click virtual patches if needed in WAF, and manage it all from a centralized cloud-based portal. WAF can be deployed in minutes on prem or in the cloud, as a virtual machine or a container, supports load-balancing as well as TLS offloading, and does not require special hardware. 
 
 Asset Management 
 
 Global AssetView (GAV): GAV constantly gathers information on all assets, including system and hardware details, running services, open ports, installed software and user accounts. Asset discovery and inventory collection is done through a combination of Qualys network scanners, Cloud Agents and passive scanners, which together collect comprehensive data from on-premises or cloud infrastructure as well as remote endpoints. In order to create consistent and uniform asset data, GAV normalizes raw discovery data to standardize every manufacturer name, product name, model and software version using Qualys ever-evolving technology catalog as a reference. This catalog automatically extends IT asset inventory with non-discoverable metadata such as hardware and software release dates, end of life dates, and license categories. This new data layer allows teams to detect issues such as unauthorized software, outdated hardware or end-of-life software, which can help properly tag, support, and secure business-critical assets.

Cybersecurity Asset Management (CSAM): CSAM is an all-in-one solution that leverages the power of the Qualys Cloud Platform with its multiple native sensors and CMDB synchronization to continuously inventory known and unknown assets, discover installed applications, and overlay business and risk context to establish asset criticality. It identifies unauthorized or end-of-life and end-of-service software and the absence of required security tools, and assesses the health of the attack surface. Further, CSAM enables response options with threat alerts and software removal and delivers regulatory reporting in support of FedRAMP, PCI-DSS and other mandates. CSAM includes External Attack Surface Management, which allows discovery of internet facing unknown assets. 
 
 Certificate Inventory (CRI): CRI continuously scans global IT assets from a single console to discover internal and external certificates issued from any certificate authority across all enterprise IT assets, both on premise and in the cloud. As a result, certificates can be renewed before they expire, which stops certificate-related outages and improves availability. It collects all certificate, vulnerability and configuration data required for certificate inventory and analysis. CRI also reveals how many certificates are out of compliance or do not follow organizational policies for key length, for signature algorithms or for the use of trusted and approved Certificate Authorities through the use of highly customizable dashboards and provides users a comprehensive overview of Qualys SSL Labs-caliber certificate grades for internal and externally facing certificates. 
 
 Cloud / Container Security 
 
 Cloud Inventory (CI): CI delivers continuous visibility into public cloud accounts. In one single-pane view, it inventories virtual machines, storage buckets, databases, security groups, Access Control Lists (ACLs), Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) and users across all regions, multiple accounts and multiple cloud platforms. CI continuously tracks assets and enables users to quickly understand the topography of their cloud environment and uncover the root cause of incidents. 
 
 Cloud Security Assessment (CSA): CSA provides a continuous assessment of the security posture of an organization s cloud resources against misconfigurations, malicious behavior, and nonstandard deployments. CSA evaluates resources against CIS benchmarks and best practices to identify misconfigured storage buckets, security groups, Relational Database Service, exposing data and the resource for public exploitation. CSA correlates host vulnerabilities and compliance data into intelligent insights which allow users to quickly detect risks throughout their complex cloud environments. With CSA, users gain real-time visibility into their up-to-date security and compliance posture of public clouds in one single-pane view. 
 
 Container Security (CS): CS delivers container-native visibility and protection throughout the entire lifecycle of containerized applications. It incorporates scanning of container images for software composition and enforcement of hardened container stack configurations for continuous policy compliance, whether the images are on the build machines, in the container registries or in the runtime cluster nodes. CS uses a unique 'layered-in' approach to provide deep visibility into all the application activities and automatically creates a behavior profile, which is enforced on each container for runtime protection. By integrating with continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines and toolchains, CS enables DevSecOps processes and transparent enforcement of security and compliance without compromising the speed and agility of containers and serverless deployment models. This leads to significant cost benefits for enterprises compared to certain legacy security solutions. 
 
 Free Services 
 
 We also offer organizations of all sizes free security and compliance services based on the Qualys Cloud Platform: 

Qualys Global AssetView app automatically creates a continuous, real-time inventory of known and unknown assets throughout a user's global IT footprint across on-premises, endpoints, multi-cloud, mobile, containers, operational technology and IoT. The app also automatically normalizes and categorizes assets to ensure clean, reliable, and consistent data. In-depth asset details provide fine-grained visibility on the system, services, installed software, network, and users. It also detects any device that connects to a user's networks, via passive scanning technology. Upon an unknown device detection, users can install a light-weight Qualys self-updating agent (3MB) to turn the device into a managed device or launch a vulnerability scan. 

Qualys Cloud Inventory continuously discovers and tracks assets and resources across public cloud deployments to provide users both real-time and historical views of cloud inventory. It collects metadata about cloud assets and resources to help users understand the relationships between public cloud assets and resources across different dimensions and then discover their threat posture based on those attributes and relationships. Cloud Inventory is limited to three accounts per public cloud platform. 

Qualys Certificate Inventory inventories and assesses all Internet-facing certificates to generate SSL/TLS configuration grades, identifies the certificate issuer and tracks certificate expirations to help stop expired and expiring certificates from interrupting critical business functions.

Our Growth Strategy 
 
 We intend to strengthen our leadership position as a trusted provider of cloud-based IT, security and compliance solutions. The key elements of our growth strategy are: 

Continue to innovate and enhance our cloud platform and suite of solutions. We intend to continue to make significant investments in research and development to extend our cloud platform s functionality by developing new security solutions and capabilities and further enhancing our existing suite of solutions. From inception through December 31, 2021, we have added the following Cloud Apps: PC, PCI, WAS, WAF, CM, SAQ, TP, FIM, GAV, SCA, CS, CI, CSA, CRI, CRA, OCA, PM, VMDR, EDR, SaaSDR, SEM, and CSAM. In 2022, we introduced CAR, XDR and NDR. 

Expand the use of our suite of solutions by our large and diverse customer base. With more than 10,000 customers, across many industries and geographies, we believe we have a significant opportunity to sell additional solutions to our customers and expand their use of our suite of solutions. Because our customers typically initially deploy one or two of our solutions in select parts of their IT infrastructures, our existing customers serve as a strong source of new sales as they expand their scope and increase their subscriptions or choose to adopt additional solutions from our integrated suite of IT, security and compliance offerings. In this regard, we continue to expand our sales execution and marketing functions to increase adoption of our newly developed solutions among our existing customers. 

Drive new customer growth and broaden our global reach. We are pursuing new customers by targeting key accounts, releasing free IT, security and compliance services and expanding both our sales and marketing organization and network of channel partners. We will continue to seek to make significant investments to encourage organizations to replace their existing security products with our cloud solutions. We intend to expand our relationships with key security consulting organizations, managed security service providers and value-added resellers to accelerate the adoption of our cloud platform. We seek to strengthen existing relationships as well as establish new relationships to increase the distribution and market awareness of our cloud platform and target new geographic regions. We also plan to partner with such security providers that can host our private cloud offering within their shared cloud platforms, helping us expand our reach in new markets and new geographies. 

Selectively pursue technology acquisitions to bolster our capabilities and leadership position. We may explore acquisitions that are complementary to and can expand the functionality of our cloud platform. We may also seek to acquire development teams to supplement our own personnel and acquire technology to increase the breadth of our cloud-based IT, security and compliance solutions. In 2022, we acquired certain intangible assets of Blue Hexagon Inc., enabling us to leverage our cloud platform with AI/machine learning to uncover behavior patterns including active vulnerability exploitation, identification of advanced network threats, and adaptive risk mitigation across all assets and applications. In 2021, we acquired certain intangible assets of Kandor Soft Labs Private Ltd. (TotalCloud), strengthening our cloud security solution by allowing customers to build user-defined workflows for custom policies and execute them on-demand for simplified security and compliance. In 2020, we acquired certain intangible assets of Spell Security Private Limited (Spell Security), expanding our endpoint behavior detection, threat hunting, malware research and multi-layered response capabilities for our EDR application.

Intellectual Property 
 
 We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary technology. As of December 31, 2022 , we have thirty issued patents, which expire from 2029 to 2040, several pending U.S. patent applications and an exclusive license to four U.S. patents. The inbound license remains in effect until the licensed patents are no longer enforceable, unless the applicable license agreement is first terminated by us or terminated by the licensor for a breach of the agreement or if we undergo certain bankruptcy events. The licenses are currently exclusive and will remain exclusive so long as we make an appropriately-timed written election and pay an annual fixed royalty for ten years thereafter. These exclusive licenses are subject to the licensor s reservation of certain r ights in the patents and subject to the U.S. government s reserved rights in the technology. We have a number of registered and unregistered trademarks. We require our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. We view our trade secrets and know-how as a significant component of our intellectual property assets, as we have spent years designing and developing the Qualys Cloud Platform, which we believe differentiates us from our competitors. 
 
 We expect that software and other solutions in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time. 
 
 Human Capital Resources 
 
 We take a holistic approach to our human capital management strategy, striving to create a culture where talented people want to come to work, develop their careers, become leaders, and make a difference for all our stakeholders and communities. Doing the right thing for our people, our communities and our environment upholds the trust of our customers, partners, employees, and stockholders, enabling us to grow our business profitably and meet the diverse needs of our constituents. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022 , we had 2,143 full-time employees, including 1,062 in research and development, 376 in sales and marketing, 478 in operations and customer support, and 227 in general and administrative. As of December 31, 2022 , approximately 75 of our employees were located outside of the United States, with 66 of our employees located in Pune, India. None of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Employees in certain European countries and Brazil have collective bargaining arrangements at the national level. We believe our employee relations are good, and we have not experienced any work stoppages.

Health and Safety 
 
 We recognize that a healthy environment and safe workplaces are critical to our business, strategy, and communities. We address environmental issues in an integrated manner to encompass protection of the environment as well as the health and safety of our workforce. For example, in response to COVID-19 and the significant increases in remote workforces in March 2020, we mandated a work from home policy to protect our employees and our communities. We also released a free cloud-based remote endpoint protection solution for 60 days that allowed IT and security teams to protect the computers of remote employees and support the health and safety of our communities. 
 
 During 2022, our workforce gradually transitioned into a hybrid work schedule, which resulted in a significant portion of our workforce working either in-person on a part-time basis, or remotely on a permanent basis. Our top priority remains providing support for our employees, partners, and customers. We are fortunate that the nature of our business allows us to successfully operate in this dynamic hybrid environment. We believe that our hybrid policy will be a key enabler to support the broad needs of critical on-site to remote employees. 
 
 We require our employees and managers to participate in myriad training programs directed at maintaining a harassment-free, diverse, and secure workplace. With our diverse employee population, we uphold the rights to work in an environment that promotes equal opportunity and prohibits discriminatory practices against race, color, national origin, ancestry, medical condition, religious creed (including religious dress and grooming practices), marital status, registered domestic partner status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, genetic characteristics and information, age, veteran status, or any other protected characteristic. Creating a respectful workplace and preventing harassment to our employees remain our on-going commitment. 
 
 Compensation and Benefits 
 
 We provide robust compensation and benefits to our employees. In addition to competitive base salaries, all qualified employees are eligible for variable pay and equity awards. 
 
 To support the health and wellness of our workforce, we offer premium health coverage with minimal out-of-pocket contributions for our global employees.

Further, the interpretation and application of international laws and regulations in many cases is uncertain, and our legal and regulatory obligations in foreign jurisdictions are subject to frequent and unexpected changes, including the potential for various regulatory or other governmental bodies to enact new or additional laws or regulations or to issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations. 
 
 Each factor above or discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or the cumulative effect of some of these factors may result in fluctuations in our operating results. This variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet expectations with respect to operating results, or those of securities analysts or investors, for a particular period. In addition, a significant percentage of our operating expenses are fixed in nature and based on forecasted trends in revenues. Accordingly, in the event of shortfalls in revenues, we are generally unable to mitigate the negative impact on margins in the short term by reducing our operating expenses. If we fail to meet or exceed expectations for our operating results for these or any other reasons, the trading price of our common stock could fall and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.

If we do not successfully anticipate market needs and opportunities or are unable to enhance our solutions and develop new solutions that meet those needs and opportunities on a timely or cost-effective basis, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business and financial condition may be harmed. 
 
 The IT, security and compliance market is characterized by rapid technological advances, customer price sensitivity, short product and service life cycles, intense competition, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards and regulatory mandates. Any of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins, and could adversely affect our renewal rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers. Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance existing solutions, introduce new solutions on a timely and cost-effective basis, meet changing customer needs, extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate and respond to emerging standards and business models. We must also continually change and improve our solutions in response to changes in operating systems, application software, computer and communications hardware, networking software, shared cloud platform infrastructures, programming tools and computer language technology. 
 
 We may not be able to anticipate future market needs and opportunities or develop enhancements or new solutions to meet such needs or opportunities in a timely manner or at all. The market for cloud solutions for IT, security and compliance continues to evolve, and it is uncertain whether our new solutions will gain market acceptance. 
 
 Our solution enhancements or new solutions could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons, including: 

failure to timely meet market demand for product functionality; 

inability to identify and provide intelligence regarding the attacks or techniques used by cyber-attackers; 

inability to inter-operate effectively with the database technologies, file systems or web applications of our prospective customers; 

defects, errors or failures; 

delays in releasing our enhancements or new solutions; 

negative publicity about their performance or effectiveness; 

introduction or anticipated introduction of products by our competitors; 

poor business conditions, causing customers to delay IT, security and compliance purchases; 

easing or changing of external regulations related to IT, security and compliance; and 

reluctance of customers to purchase cloud solutions for IT, security and compliance. 

Furthermore, diversifying our solutions and expanding into new IT, security and compliance markets will require significant investment and planning, require that our research and development and sales and marketing organizations develop expertise in these new markets, bring us more directly into competition with IT, security compliance providers that may be better established or have greater resources than we do, require additional investment of time and resources in the development and training of our channel partners and entail significant risk of failure. 
 
 If we fail to anticipate market requirements or fail to develop and introduce solution enhancements or new solutions to satisfy those requirements in a timely manner, such failure could substantially decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future solutions and cause us to lose existing customers or fail to gain new customers, which would significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 If we fail to continue to effectively scale and adapt our platform to meet the performance and other requirements of our customers, our operating results and our business would be harmed. 
 
 Our future growth depends to a significant extent on our ability to continue to meet the expanding needs of our customers as their use of our cloud platform grows. As these customers gain more experience with our solutions, the number of users and the number of locations where our solutions are being accessed may expand rapidly in the future. In order to ensure that we meet the performance and other requirements of our customers, we intend to continue to make significant investments to develop and implement new proprietary and third-party technologies at all levels of our cloud platform. These technologies, which include databases, applications and server optimizations, and network and hosting strategies, are often complex, new and unproven. We may not be successful in developing or implementing these technologies. To the extent that we do not effectively scale our platform to maintain performance as our customers expand their use of our platform, our operating results and our business may be harmed.

If we are unable to renew existing subscriptions for our IT, security and compliance solutions, sell additional subscriptions for our solutions and attract new customers, our operating results would be harmed. 
 
 We offer our Qualys Cloud Platform and integrated suite of solutions pursuant to a software-as-a-service model, and our customers purchase subscriptions from us that are generally one year in length. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions after their subscription period expires, and they may not renew their subscriptions at the same or higher levels or at all. As a result, our ability to grow depends in part on customers renewing their existing subscriptions and purchasing additional subscriptions and solutions. Our customers may choose not to renew their subscriptions to our solutions or purchase additional solutions due to a number of factors, including their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our solutions, the prices of our solutions, the prices of products or services offered by our competitors, reductions in our customers spending levels due to the macroeconomic environment or other factors. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions to our solutions, renew on less favorable terms, or do not purchase additional solutions or subscriptions, our revenues may grow more slowly than expected or decline and our operating results would be harmed. 
 
 In addition, our future growth depends in part upon increasing our customer base. Our ability to achieve significant growth in revenues in the future will depend, in large part, upon continually attracting new customers and obtaining subscription renewals to our solutions from those customers. If we fail to attract new customers, our revenues may grow more slowly than expected and our operating results would be harmed. 
 
 Our current research and development efforts may not produce successful products or enhancements to our platform that result in significant revenue, cost savings or other benefits in the near future. 
 
 We must continue to dedicate significant financial and other resources to our research and development efforts if we are to maintain our competitive position. However, developing products and enhancements to our platform is expensive and time consuming, and there is no assurance that such activities will result in significant new marketable products or enhancements to our platform, design improvements, cost savings, revenue or other expected benefits. If we spend significant resources on research and development and are unable to generate an adequate return on our investment, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

Our platform, website and internal systems may be subject to intentional disruption or other security incidents that could result in liability and adversely impact our reputation and future sales. 
 
 We and our service providers face threats from a variety of sources, including attacks on our networks and systems from numerous sources, including traditional hackers, sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors, other sources of malicious code (such as viruses and worms), ransomware, social engineering, denial of service attacks, and phishing attempts. We and our service providers could be a target of cyber-attacks or other malfeasance designed to impede the performance of our solutions, penetrate our network security or the security of our cloud platform or our internal systems, misappropriate proprietary information and/or cause interruptions to our services. We and our service providers have experienced and may continue to experience security incidents and attacks of varying degrees from time to time. For example, in December 2020, we were notified by a service provider, Accellion, of a zero-day vulnerability affecting an Accellion FTA server that we deployed to transfer information as part of our customer support system. In response to this incident, we engaged third-party forensic experts to investigate and determined that attackers illegally obtained certain information from the Accellion FTA server. We notified affected customers, as we deemed was required or appropriate. We have incurred costs to respond to this incident and may continue to incur costs to support our efforts to enhance our security measures. Additionally, due to political uncertainty and military actions associated with Russia s invasion of Ukraine, we and our service providers are vulnerable to heightened risks of cybersecurity incidents and security and privacy breaches from or affiliated with nation-state actors, including attacks that could materially disrupt our systems, operations and services. 
 
 Our solutions, platforms, and system, and those of our service providers, may also suffer security incidents as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent acts or omissions by our employees or service providers. With the increase in personnel working remotely during the current COVID-19 pandemic, we and our service providers are at increased risk for security breaches. We have taken and intend to continue to take steps to monitor and enhance the security of our solutions, cloud platform, and other relevant systems, IT infrastructure, networks, and data; however, the unprecedented scale of remote work may require additional personnel and resources, which nevertheless cannot be guaranteed to fully safeguard our solutions, our cloud platform, or any systems, IT infrastructure networks, or data upon which we rely. Further, because our operations involve providing IT security solutions to our customers, we may be targeted for cyber-attacks and other security incidents. A breach in our data security or an attack against our service availability, or that of our third-party service providers, could impact our networks or networks secured by our solutions, creating system disruptions or slowdowns and exploiting security vulnerabilities of our solutions, and the information stored on our networks or those of our third-party service providers could be accessed, used, publicly disclosed, altered, lost, or stolen, which could subject us to liability and cause us financial harm. If an actual or perceived disruption in the availability of our solutions or the breach of our security measures or those of our service providers occurs, it could adversely affect the market perception of our solutions, result in a loss of competitive advantage, have a negative impact on our reputation, or result in the loss of customers, channel partners and sales, and it may expose us to the loss or alteration of information, litigation, regulatory actions and investigations and possible liability. Any such actual or perceived security breach or disruption could also divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. We also may incur significant costs and operational consequences of investigating, remediating, eliminating and putting in place additional tools and devices designed to prevent actual or perceived security incidents, as well as the costs to comply with any notification obligations resulting from any security incidents. In addition, any such actual or perceived security breach could impair our ability to operate our business and provide solutions to our customers. If this happens, our reputation could be harmed, our revenues could decline and our business could suffer. 
 
 Although we maintain insurance coverage that may be applicable to certain liabilities in the event of a security breach or other security incident, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities that actually are incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results and reputation. 
 
 Our sales cycle can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. As a result, revenues may vary from period to period, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate and could harm our business. 
 
 The timing of sales of subscriptions for our solutions can be difficult to forecast because of the length and unpredictability of our sales cycle, particularly with large transactions. We sell subscriptions to our IT, security and compliance solutions primarily to IT departments that are managing a growing set of user and compliance demands, which has increased the complexity of customer requirements to be met and confirmed during the sales cycle and prolonged our sales cycle. Further, the length of time that potential customers devote to their testing and evaluation, contract negotiation and budgeting processes varies significantly, which has also made our sales cycle long and unpredictable. The length of the sales cycle for our solutions typically ranges from six to twelve months but can be more than eighteen months. In addition, we might devote substantial time and effort to a particular unsuccessful sales effort, and as a result we could lose other sales opportunities or incur expenses that are not offset by an increase in revenues, which could harm our business.

Adverse economic conditions or reduced IT spending may adversely impact our business. 
 
 Our business depends to a significant extent on the overall demand for IT and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers. Economic weakness, customer financial difficulties, supply chain constraints, change in interest rates, inflationary pressures and potential for a recession, and constrained spending on IT security, which factors we have experienced in 2022, have resulted and may in the future result in decreased revenue and earnings. Such factors have made and could in the future make it difficult to accurately forecast our sales and operating results and could negatively affect our ability to provide accurate forecasts to our contract manufacturers. In addition, continued governmental budgetary challenges in the United States and Europe, inflationary pressures and potential for a recession, and geopolitical turmoil in many parts of the world, including the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and other disruptions to global and regional economies and markets in many parts of the world, as well as uncertainties related to changes in public policies such as domestic and international regulations, taxes or international trade agreements, have and may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions and overall spending on IT security and may further increase inflation, both in the U.S. and globally, which could increase our operating costs in the future and reduce overall spending on IT security. General economic weakness may also lead to longer collection cycles for payments due from our customers, an increase in customer bad debt, restructuring initiatives and associated expenses, and impairment of investments. Furthermore, the continued weakness and uncertainty in worldwide credit markets, including the sovereign debt situation in certain countries in the European Union, may adversely impact our European operations, as well as our current and potential customers' available budgetary spending, which could lead to delays or reductions in planned purchases of our solutions. 
 
 Uncertainty about future economic conditions also makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. Future or continued economic weakness for us or our customers, failure of our customers and markets to recover from such weakness, customer financial difficulties, and reductions in spending on IT security could have a material adverse effect on demand for our platform and consequently on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our IT, security and compliance solutions are delivered from 11 shared cloud platforms , and any disruption of service at these facilities would interrupt or delay our ability to deliver our solutions to our customers which could reduce our revenues and harm our operating results. 
 
 We currently host substantially all of our solutions from third-party shared cloud platforms located in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, the Netherlands, United Arab Emirates, Australia, United Kingdom and India. These facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, cybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks, employee negligence, power losses, telecommunications failures and similar events. The facilities also could be subjec t to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct. The occurrence of a natural disaster, an act of terrorism or misconduct, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in interruptions in our services. 
 
 Some of our shared cloud platforms are not currently redundant and we may not be able to rapidly move our customers from one shared cloud platform to another, which may increase delays in the restoration of our service for our customers if an adverse event occurs. We have added shared cloud platforms to provide additional capacity and to enable disaster recovery. We continue to build out these facilities; however, these additional facilities may not be operational in the anticipated time-frame and we may incur unplanned expenses. 
 
 Additionally, our existing shared cloud platform providers have no obligations to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew our agreements with the facilities providers on commercially reasonable terms or if in the future we add additional shared cloud platform providers, we may experience costs or downtime in connection with the loss of an existing facility or the transfer to, or addition of, new facilities. 
 
 Any disruptions or other performance problems with our solutions could harm our reputation and business and may damage our customers businesses. Interruptions in our service delivery might reduce our revenues, cause us to issue credits to customers, subject us to potential liability and cause customers to terminate their subscriptions or not renew their subscriptions. 
 
 We face competition in our markets, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position. 
 
 We compete with a large range of established and emerging vulnerability management vendors, compliance vendors and data security vendors in a highly fragmented and competitive environment. We face significant competition for each of our solutions from companies with broad product suites and greater name recognition and resources than we have, as well as from small companies focused on specialized security solutions. 
 
 We compete with large and small public companies, such as Broadcom (Symantec Enterprise Security), CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, Rapid7, Tenable Holdings, as well as privately held security providers including Axonius, Checkmarx, Flexera, Invicti, Ivanti, Tanium, HelpSystems (Tripwire), Trustwave Holdings and Veracode. We also seek to replace IT, security and compliance solutions that organizations have developed internally. As we continue to extend our cloud platform s functionality by further developing IT, security and compliance solutions, such as web application scanning and firewalls, we expect to face additional competition in these new markets. Our competitors may also attempt to further expand their presence in the IT, security and compliance market and compete more directly against one or more of our solutions.

We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our markets include product functionality, breadth of offerings, flexibility of delivery models, ease of deployment and use, total cost of ownership, scalability and performance, customer support and extensibility of platform. Many of our existing and potential competitors have competitive advantages, including: 

greater brand name recognition; 

larger sales and marketing budgets and resources; 

broader distribution networks and more established relationships with distributors and customers; 

access to larger customer bases; 

greater customer support resources; 

greater resources to make acquisitions; 

greater resources to develop and introduce products that compete with our solutions; 

greater resources to meet relevant regulatory requirements; and 

substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. 

As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. With the introduction of new technologies, the evolution of our service and new market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. 
 
 In addition, some of our larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and can bundle competing products and services with other software offerings. As a result, customers may choose a bundled product offering from our competitors, even if individual products have more limited functionality than our solutions. These competitors may also offer their products at a lower price as part of this larger sale, which could increase pricing pressure on our solutions and cause the average sales price for our solutions to decline. These larger competitors are also often in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending and will therefore not be as susceptible to economic downturns. 
 
 Furthermore, our current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources and product and services offerings in the markets we address. In addition, current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources. As a result of such relationships and acquisitions, our current or potential competitors might be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs, devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their products and services, initiate or withstand substantial price competition, take advantage of other opportunities more readily or develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we do. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors. 
 
 The sales prices of our solutions are subject to competitive pressures and may decrease, which may reduce our gross profits and adversely impact our financial results. 
 
 The sales prices for our solutions may decline for a variety of reasons, including competitive pricing pressures, discounts, a change in our mix of solutions and subscriptions, anticipation of the introduction of new solutions or subscriptions, or promotional programs. Competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate, and we expect competition to further increase in the future, thereby leading to increased pricing pressures. Larger competitors with more diverse product and service offerings may reduce the price of products or subscriptions that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and subscriptions. Additionally, although we price our products and subscriptions worldwide in U.S. Dollars, Euros, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Japanese Yen and Indian Rupee, currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions may negatively impact actual prices that partners and customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions, or the effective prices we realize in our reporting currency. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing and introducing new offerings with enhanced functionality on a timely basis, or that our new product and subscription offerings, if introduced, will enable us to maintain our prices and gross profits at levels that will allow us to maintain positive gross margins and profitability. 
 
 If our solutions fail to help our customers achieve and maintain compliance with regulations and industry standards, our revenues and operating results could be harmed. 
 
 We generate a portion of our revenues from solutions that help organizations achieve and maintain compliance with regulations and industry standards. For example, many of our customers subscribe to our IT, security and compliance solutions to help them comply with the security standards developed and maintained by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, or the PCI Council, which apply to companies that store cardholder data. Industry organizations like the PCI Council may significantly change their security standards with little or no notice, including changes that could make their standards more or less onerous for businesses. Governments may also adopt new laws or regulations, or make changes to existing laws or regulations, that could impact the demand for or value of our solutions. 
 
 If we are unable to adapt our solutions to changing regulatory standards in a timely manner, or if our solutions fail to assist with or expedite our customers compliance initiatives, our customers may lose confidence in our solutions and could switch to products offered by our competitors. In addition, if regulations and standards related to data security, vulnerability management and other IT, security and compliance requirements are relaxed or the penalties for non-compliance are changed in a manner that makes them less onerous, our customers may view government and industry regulatory compliance as less critical to their businesses, and our customers may be less willing to purchase our solutions. In any of these cases, our revenues and operating results could be harmed.

If our solutions fail to detect vulnerabilities or incorrectly detect vulnerabilities, our brand and reputation could be harmed, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 
 If our solutions fail to detect vulnerabilities in our customers IT infrastructures, or if our solutions fail to identify and respond to new and increasingly complex methods of attacks, our business and reputation may suffer. There is no guarantee that our solutions will detect all vulnerabilities. Additionally, our IT, security and compliance solutions may falsely detect vulnerabilities or threats that do not actually exist. For example, some of our solutions rely on information on attack sources aggregated from third-party data providers who monitor global malicious activity originating from a variety of sources, including anonymous proxies, specific IP addresses, botnets and phishing sites. If the information from these data providers is inaccurate, the potential for false indications of security vulnerabilities increases. These false positives, while typical in the industry, may impair the perceived reliability or usability of our solutions and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our solutions and could result in negative publicity, loss of customers and sales, increased costs to remedy any incorrect information or problem, or claims by aggrieved parties. Similar issues may be generated by the misuse of our tools to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. 
 
 Further, our solutions sometimes are tested against other security products, and may fail to perform as effectively, or to be perceived as performing as effectively, as competitive products for any number of reasons, including misconfiguration. To the extent current or potential customers, channel partners, or others believe there has been an occurrence of an actual or perceived failure of our solutions to detect a vulnerability or otherwise to function as effectively as competitive products in any particular test, or indicates our solutions do not provide significant value, our business, competitive position, and reputation could be harmed. 
 
 In addition, our solutions do not currently extend to cover all mobile and personal devices that employees may bring into an organization. As such, our solutions would not identify or address vulnerabilities in all mobile and personal devices, and our customers IT infrastructures may be compromised by attacks that infiltrate their networks through such devices. 
 
 An actual or perceived security breach or theft of the sensitive data of one of our customers, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to the failure of our solutions, could adversely affect the market s perception of our security solutions. 
 
 If we are unable to continue the expansion of our sales force, sales of our solutions and the growth of our business would be harmed. 
 
 We believe that our growth will depend, to a significant extent, on our success in recruiting and retaining a sufficient number of qualified sales personnel and their ability to obtain new customers, manage our existing customer base and expand the sales of our newer solutions. We plan to continue to expand our sales force and make a significant investment in our sales and marketing activities. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as quickly as we would like, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the competitive markets where we do business. Competition for highly skilled personnel is frequently intense and we may not be able to compete for these employees. If we are unable to recruit and retain a sufficient number of productive sales personnel, sales of our solutions and the growth of our business may be harmed. Additionally, if our efforts do not result in increased revenues, our operating results could be negatively impacted due to the upfront operating expenses associated with expanding our sales force. 
 
 We rely on third-party channel partners to generate a substantial amount of our revenues, and if we fail to expand and manage our distribution channels, our revenues could decline and our growth prospects could suffer. 
 
 Our success significantly depends to a significant extent on establishing and maintaining relationships with a variety of channel partners and we anticipate that we will continue to depend on these partners in order to grow our business. For th e years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we derived approximately 42 , 41 and 42 , respectively, o f our revenues from sales of subscriptions for our solutions through channel partners, and the percentage of revenues derived from channel partners may increase in future periods. Our agreements with our channel partners are generally non-exclusive and do not prohibit them from working with our competitors or offering competing solutions, and many of our channel partners have more established relationships with our competitors. If our channel partners choose to place greater emphasis on products of their own or those offered by our competitors, do not effectively market and sell our solutions, or fail to meet the needs of our customers, then our ability to grow our business and sell our solutions may be adversely affected. In addition, the loss of one or more of our larger channel partners, who may cease marketing our solutions with limited or no notice, and our possible inability to replace them, could adversely affect our sales. Moreover, our ability to expand our distribution channels depends in part on our ability to educate our channel partners about our solutions, which can be complex. Our failure to recruit additional channel partners, or any reduction or delay in their sales of our solutions or conflicts between channel sales and our direct sales and marketing activities may harm our results of operations. Even if we are successful, these relationships may not result in greater customer usage of our solutions or increased revenues. 
 
 In addition, the financial health of our channel partners and our continuing relationships with them are important to our success. Some of these channel partners may be unable to withstand adverse changes in economic conditions, which could result in insolvency and/or the inability of such distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and services. In addition, weakness in the end-user market could negatively affect the cash flows of our channel partners who could, in turn, delay paying their obligations to us, which would increase our credit risk exposure. Our business could be harmed if the financial condition of some of these channel partners substantially weakened and we were unable to timely secure replacement channel partners.

A significant portion of our customers, channel partners and employees are located outside of the United States, which subjects us to a number of risks associated with conducting international operations, and if we are unable to successfully manage these risks, our business and operating results could be harmed. 
 
 We market and sell subscriptions to our solutions throughout the world and have personnel in many parts of the world. In addition, we have sales offices and research and development facilities outside the United States and we conduct, and expect to continue to conduct, a significant amount of our business with organizations that are located outside the United States, particularly in Europe and Asia. Therefore, we are subject to risks associated with having international sales and worldwide operations, including: 

foreign currency exchange fluctuations; 

trade and foreign exchange restrictions; 

economic or political instability in foreign markets, including as a result of increasing tensions between India and China; 

greater difficulty in enforcing contracts, accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods; 

changes in regulatory requirements; 

tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries); 

difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations; 

the uncertainty and limitation of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; 

costs of compliance with foreign laws and regulations and the risks and costs of non-compliance with such laws and regulations; 

costs of complying with U.S. laws and regulations for foreign operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell our solutions in certain foreign markets, and the risks and costs of non-compliance; 

heightened risks of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of, and irregularities in, financial statements; 

the potential for political unrest, acts of terrorism, hostilities or war; 

management communication and integration problems resulting from cultural differences and geographic dispersion; and 

multiple and possibly overlapping tax structures. 

Some of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above. Even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations, our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks. 
 
 Our business, including the sales of subscriptions of our solutions, may be subject to foreign governmental regulations, which vary substantially from country to country and change from time to time. Failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business. Further, in many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or U.S. regulations applicable to us. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, channel partners and agents have complied or will comply with these laws and policies. Violations of laws or key control policies by our employees, contractors, channel partners or agents could result in delays in revenue recognition, financial reporting misstatements, fines, penalties or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our solutions and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. If we are unable to successfully manage the challenges of international operations, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. 
 
 In addition, as of December 31, 2022, approximately 75 of our employees were located outside of the United States, with 66 of our employees located in Pune, India. Accordingly, we are exposed to changes in laws governing our employee relationships in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, including laws and regulations regarding wage and hour requirements, fair labor standards, employee data privacy, unemployment tax rates, workers compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll and other taxes which may have a direct impact on our operating costs. We may continue to expand our international operations and international sales and marketing activities. Expansion in international markets has required, and will continue to require, significant management attention and resources. We may be unable to scal e our infrastructure effectively or as quickly as our competitors in these markets and our revenues may not increase to offset any increased costs and operating expenses, which would cause our results to suffer.

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar and we generate a majority of our revenues in U.S. dollars. However, for the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred approximately 29 of our expenses in foreign currencies, primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Indian Rupee, principally with respect to salaries and related personnel expenses associated with our European and Indian operations. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 24 of our revenue s were generated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. The exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies has fluctuated substantially in recent years and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future. We expect that a majority of our revenues will continue to be generated in U.S. dollars for the foreseeable future and that a significant portion of our expenses, including personnel costs, as well as capital and operating expenditures, will continue to be denominated in the Euro, British Pound and Indian Rupee. The result of our operations may be adversely affected by foreign exchange fluctuations. 
 
 We use derivative financial instruments to reduce our foreign currency exchange risks. We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of certain non-U.S. dollar denominated net asset positions, to date primarily cash, accounts receivable and operating lease liabilities (non-designated), as well as to manage foreign currency fluctuation risk related to forecasted transactions (designated). However, we may not be able to purchase derivative instruments that are adequate to insulate ourselves from foreign currency exchange risks. Additionally, our hedging activities may contribute to increased losses as a result of volatility in foreign currency markets. 
 
 If the market for cloud solutions for IT, security and compliance does not evolve as we anticipate, our revenues may not grow and our operating results would be harmed. 
 
 Our success depends to a significant extent on the willingness of organizations to increase their use of cloud solutions for their IT, security and compliance. Some organizations may be reluctant to use cloud solutions because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with the reliability or security of the technology delivery model associated with these solutions. If other cloud service providers experience security incidents, loss of customer data, disruptions in service delivery or other problems, the market for cloud solutions as a whole, including our solutions, may be negatively impacted. Moreover, organizations that have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate on-premise software into their businesses may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to a cloud solution. Organizations that use on-premise security products, such as network firewalls, security information and event management products or data loss prevention solutions, may also believe that these products sufficiently protect their IT infrastructure and deliver adequate security. Therefore, they may continue spending their IT security budgets on these products and may not adopt our IT, security and compliance solutions in addition to or as a replacement for such products. 
 
 If customers do not recognize the benefits of our cloud solutions over traditional on-premise enterprise software products, and as a result we are unable to increase sales of subscriptions to our solutions, then our revenues may not grow or may decline, and our operating results would be harmed. 
 
 Our business and operations have continued to grow since inception, and if we do not appropriately manage any future growth, or are unable to improve our systems and processes, our operating results may be negatively affected. 
 
 We have continued to grow over the last several years, with revenues increasing from 363.0 million in 2020 to 489.7 million in 2022, and headcount increasing from 1,498 employees at the beginning of 2020 to 2,143 employees as of December 31, 2022. We rely on information technology systems to help manage critical functions such as order processing, revenue recognition and financial forecasts. To manage any future growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our IT systems, financial infrastructure, and operating and administrative systems and controls, and continue to manage headcount, capital and processes in an efficient manner. We may not be able to successfully implement improvements to these systems and processes in a timely or efficient manner. 
 
 Our failure to improve our systems and processes, or their failure to operate in the intended manner, may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to accurately forecast our revenues, expenses and earnings, or to prevent certain losses. In addition, as we continue to grow, our productivity and the quality of our solutions may also be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively. Any future growth would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination across our organization. Failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs, harm our results of operations and lead to investors losing confidence in our internal systems and processes. 
 
 We depend on the continued services and performance of our senior management and other key employees, the loss of any of whom could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 
 Our future performance depends to a significant extent on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management and other key employees, to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations. We do not maintain key-man insurance for any member of our senior management team. Our senior management and key employees are generally employed on an at-will basis, which means that they could terminate their employment with us at any time. From time to time, there may be changes in our senior management team resulting from the termination or departure of executives. For example, we recently announced that we and our Chief Revenue Officer mutually agreed to end his employment on March 31, 2023. The loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees for any reason could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 If we are unable to hire, retain and motivate qualified personnel, our business may suffer. 
 
 Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly in engineering and sales, may seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any of our employees may terminate their employment at any time. Competition for highly skilled personnel is frequently intense, especially within our industry, and we may not be able to compete for such personnel.

We are required under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) to recognize compensation expense in our operating results for employee stock-based compensation under our equity grant programs, which may negatively impact our operating results and may increase the pressure to limit stock-based compensation that we might otherwise offer to current or potential employees, thereby potentially harming our ability to attract or retain highly skilled personnel. In addition, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or divulged proprietary or other confidential information, which could result in a diversion of management's time and our resources. 
 
 A portion of our revenues are generated by sales to government entities, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks. 
 
 Government entities have historically been particularly concerned about adopting cloud-based solutions for their operations, including security solutions, and increasing sales of subscriptions for our solutions to government entities may be more challenging than selling to commercial organizations. Selling to government entities can be highly competitive, expensive and time-consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will win a sale. We have invested in the creation of a cloud offering certified under the Federal Information Security Management Act for government usage but we cannot be sure that we will continue to sustain or renew this certification, that the government will continue to mandate such certification or that other government agencies or entities will use this cloud offering. Government demand and payment for our solutions may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our solutions. Government entities may have contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our channel partners for convenience or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely impact our future results of operations. Governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors administrative processes, and any unfavorable audit could result in the government refusing to continue buying our solutions, a reduction of revenues or fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities. Any such penalties could adversely impact our results of operations in a material way. 
 
 Our success in acquiring and integrating other businesses, products or technologies could impact our financial position. 
 
 In order to remain competitive, we have in the past and may in the future seek to acquire additional businesses, products, services or technologies. For example, we acquired certain intellectual property of Spell Security on July 24, 2020, certain intellectual property of TotalCloud on August 19, 2021 and certain assets of Blue Hexagon on October 4, 2022. The environment for acquisitions in our industry is very competitive and acquisition candidate purchase prices may exceed what we would prefer to pay. Moreover, achieving the anticipated benefits of past and future acquisitions will depend in part upon whether we can integrate acquired operations, products and technology in a timely and cost-effective manner, and even if we achieve benefits from acquisitions, such acquisitions may still be viewed negatively by customers, financial markets or investors. The acquisition and integration process is complex, expensive and time-consuming, and may cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, product development and sales activities and operations of both companies, as well as divert the attention of management, and we may incur substantial cost and expense. We may issue equity securities which could dilute current stockholders ownership, incur debt, assume contingent or other liabilities and expend cash in acquisitions, which could negatively impact our financial position, stockholder equity and stock price. We may not find suitable acquisition candidates, and acquisitions we complete may be unsuccessful. If we consummate a transaction, we may be unable to integrate and manage acquired products and businesses effectively or retain key personnel. If we are unable to effectively execute acquisitions, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.

We rely on software-as-a-service vendors to operate certain functions of our business and any failure of such vendors to provide services to us could adversely impact our business and operations. 
 
 We rely on third-party software-as-a-service vendors to operate certain critical functions of our business, including financial management and human resource management. If these services become unavailable due to extended outages or interruptions or because they are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms or prices, our expenses could increase, our ability to manage our finances could be interrupted and our processes for managing sales of our solutions and supporting our customers could be impaired until equivalent services, if available, are identified, obtained and integrated, all of which could harm our business. 
 
 Incorrect or improper implementation or use of our solutions could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business and reputation. 
 
 If our customers are unable to implement our solutions successfully, customer perceptions of our platform and solutions may be impaired or our reputation and brand may suffer. Our customers have in the past inadvertently misused our solutions, which triggered downtime in their internal infrastructure until the problem was resolved. Additionally, any failure to implement and configure our solutions correctly may result in our solutions failing to detect vulnerabilities or compliance issues, or otherwise to perform effectively, and may result in disruptions to our customers IT environments and businesses. Any misuse of our solutions, including any failure to implement and configure them appropriately, could result in disruption to our customers businesses, customer dissatisfaction, negative impacts on the perceived reliability or effectiveness of our solutions, and claims and litigation, and may result in negative press coverage, negative effects on our reputation and competitive position, a loss of sales, customers, and channel partners, and harm our financial results. 
 
 We recognize revenues from subscriptions over the term of the relevant service period, and therefore any decreases or increases in bookings are not immediately reflected in our operating results. 
 
 We recognize revenues from subscriptions over the term of the relevant service period, which is typically one year. As a result, most of our reported revenues in each quarter are derived from the recognition of deferred revenues relating to subscriptions entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a shortfall in demand for our solutions in any period may not significantly reduce our revenues for that period, but could negatively affect revenues in future periods. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in bookings may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. We may be unable to adjust our costs and expenses to compensate for such a potential shortfall in revenues. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenues through additional bookings in any period, as revenues are recognized ratably over the subscription period. 
 
 Our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as terrorism. 
 
 A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or a flood, or a significant power outage could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our corporate headquarters and a significant portion of our operations are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. In addition, natural disasters could affect our business partners ability to perform services for us on a timely basis. In the event we or our business partners are hindered by any of the events discussed above, our ability to provide our solutions to customers could be delayed, resulting in our missing financial targets, such as revenues and net income, for a particular quarter. Further, if a natural disaster occurs in a region from which we derive a significant portion of our revenues, customers in that region may delay or forego subscriptions of our solutions, which may materially and adversely impact our results of operations for a particular period. In addition, war, acts of terrorism, pandemics or other health emergencies, or responses to these events could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our business partners, customers or the economy as a whole. All of the aforementioned risks may be exacerbated if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate. To the extent that any of the above results in delays of customer subscriptions or commercialization of our solutions, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Risks Related to Intellectual Property, Legal, Tax and Regulatory Matters 
 
 Undetected software errors or flaws in our solutions could harm our reputation, decrease market acceptance of our solutions or result in liability. 
 
 Our solutions may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or as new versions are released. We have experienced these errors or defects in the past in connection with new solutions and solution upgrades and we expect that these errors or defects will be found from time to time in the future in new or enhanced solutions after commercial release of these solutions. Since our customers use our solutions for IT, security and compliance reasons, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our solutions, or any other failure of our solutions to detect vulnerabilities or compliance problems or otherwise to perform effectively, may result in disruptions or damage to the business of our customers, including security breaches or compliance failures. Additionally, any such issues, or the perception that they have occurred, whether or not relating to any actual or perceived error or defect in our solutions, could hurt our reputation and competitive position and we may incur significant costs, the attention of key personnel could be diverted, our customers may delay or withhold payment to us or elect not to renew, we could face a loss of sales, customers, and channel partners, and other significant problems with our relationships with customers and channel partners may arise. We may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to actual or perceived errors or defects in our solutions. A material liability claim or other occurrence that harms our reputation or decreases market acceptance of our solutions may harm our business, competitive and financial position, and operating results. 
 
 Although we maintain insurance coverage that may be applicable to certain liabilities in connection with these matters, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities that actually are incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results and reputation. 
 
 Our solutions could be used to collect and store personal information of our customers employees or customers, and therefore privacy and other data handling concerns could result in additional cost and liability to us or inhibit sales of our solutions. 
 
 We collect the names and email addresses of our customers in connection with subscriptions to our solutions. Additionally, the data that our solutions collect to help secure and protect the IT infrastructure of our customers may include additional personal or confidential information of our customers employees and their customers. Personal privacy has become a significant issue in the United States and in many other countries where we offer our solutions. The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Many federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, disclosure and retention of personal information. In the United States, these include, for example, rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and state breach notification laws. Internationally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply. 
 
 These privacy, data protection and information security laws and regulations may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. Additionally, new laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection continue to be proposed and enacted. For example, the European Union has adopted the Global Data Protection Regulation GDPR ). This regulation, which took effect in May of 2018, provides for substantial obligations relating to the handling, storage and other processing of data relating to individuals and administrative fines for violations, which can be up to four percent of the previous year s annual revenue or 20 million, whichever is higher. The GDPR may be subject to new or changing interpretations by courts, and our interpretation of the law and efforts to comply with the rules and regulations of the law may be ruled invalid. Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA requires covered companies to, among other things, provide new disclosures to California consumers and affords such consumers new rights to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action for statutory damages for certain breaches of information. Certain aspects of the CCPA and its interpretation remain uncertain and are likely to remain uncertain for an extended period. Additionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act CPRA ), was approved by voters in the November 3, 2020 election. The CPRA modifies the CCPA significantly, creating obligations relating to consumer data beginning on January 1, 2022, and enforcement is expected to commence on July 1, 2023. Passage of the CPRA has resulted in further uncertainty and may require us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. In addition, other states have enacted or proposed legislation that regulates the collection, use, and sale of personal information, and such regimes might not be compatible with the GDPR, the CCPA or the CPRA or may require us to undertake additional practices. Accordingly, we cannot yet predict the impact of the CCPA, CRPA or other evolving privacy and data protection obligations on our business or operations, but it may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. 
 
 The privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations we must comply with also are subject to change. For example, the United Kingdom enacted a Data Protection Act in May 2018 that substantially implements the GDPR, but the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit, could lead to further legislative and regulatory changes. It remains unclear how United Kingdom data protection laws or regulations will develop in the medium to longer term and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated. Additionally, we have joined the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and a related program, the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, and adopted certain standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission SCCs as part of our data processing agreements with regard to certain transfers of personal data from the European Economic Area EEA to the U.S. to ensure that we work with vendors that have adopted the same, where appropriate. While both the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and SCCs have been subject to legal challenge, we continue to analyze the July 2020 Schrems II decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union CJEU and its impact on our data transfer mechanisms as well as subsequent guidance from data privacy regulators and new SCCs published by the European Commission in June 2021, and we may find it necessary or appropriate to take different or additional steps with respect to transfers of personal data, which may result in increased costs of compliance and limitations on our customers and us. We may be unsuccessful in maintaining legitimate means for our transfer and receipt of personal data from the EEA or Switzerland. We may experience reluctance or refusal by current or prospective European customers to use our products, and we and our customers may face a risk of enforcement actions by data protection authorities in the EEA relating to personal data transfers to us and by us from the EEA. Any such enforcement actions could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, distract management and technical personnel and negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Some countries also are considering or have passed legislation requiring local storage and processing of data, or similar requirements, which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.

Table of Contents 

In addition to laws and regulations, privacy advocacy and industry groups or other private parties may propose new and different privacy standards that either legally or contractually apply to us. Because the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws, regulations, standards and contractual obligations are uncertain, it is possible that they may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is, or perceived to be, inconsistent with our data management practices or the features of our solutions. If so, in addition to the possibility of regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, fines, lawsuits and other claims, other forms of injunctive or operations-limiting relief, and damage to our reputations and loss of goodwill, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our solutions and may face limitations in our ability to develop new solutions and features, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. Any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or any actual or perceived inability to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations and privacy standards, could result in cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales of subscriptions and harm our business. 
 
 Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, and privacy standards that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of, and reduce the overall demand for, our solutions. Privacy concerns, whether valid or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our solutions particularly in certain industries and foreign countries. 
 
 Our solutions contain third-party open source software components, and our failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our solutions. 
 
 Our solutions contain software licensed to us by third-parties under so-called open source licenses, including the GNU General Public License, the GNU Lesser General Public License, the BSD License, the Apache License and others. From time to time, there have been claims against companies that distribute or use open source software in their products and services, asserting that such open source software infringes the claimants intellectual property rights. We could be subject to suits by parties claiming that what we believe to be licensed open source software infringes their intellectual property rights. Use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, certain open source licenses require that source code for software programs that are subject to the license be made available to the public and that any modifications or derivative works to such open source software continue to be licensed under the same terms. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in certain ways, we could, in some circumstances, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. Disclosing the source code of our proprietary software could make it easier for cyber attackers and other third parties to discover vulnerabilities in or to defeat the protections of our solutions, which could result in our solutions failing to provide our customers with the security they expect from our services. This could harm our business and reputation. Disclosing our proprietary source code also could allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of sales for us. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 
 Although we monitor our use of open source software in an effort both to comply with the terms of the applicable open source licenses and to avoid subjecting our solutions to conditions we do not intend, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions. In this event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our solutions, to make our proprietary code generally available in source code form, to re-engineer our solutions or to discontinue the sale of our solutions if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.

Table of Contents 

We use third-party software and data that may be difficult to replace or cause errors or failures of our solutions that could lead to lost customers or harm to our reputation and our operating results. 
 
 We license third-party software as well as security and compliance data from various third parties to deliver our solutions. In the future, this software or data may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this software or data could result in delays in the provisioning of our solutions until equivalent technology or data is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated, which could harm our business. In addition, any errors or defects in or failures of this third-party software or data could result in errors or defects in our solutions or cause our solutions to fail, which could harm our business and be costly to correct. Many of these providers attempt to impose limitations on their liability for such errors, defects or failures, and if enforceable, we may have additional liability to our customers or third-party providers that could harm our reputation and increase our operating costs. 
 
 We will need to maintain our relationships with third-party software and data providers, and to obtain software and data from such providers that do not contain any errors or defects. Any failure to do so could adversely impact our ability to deliver effective solutions to our customers and could harm our operating results. 
 
 Failure to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business and operating results. 
 
 The success of our business depends in part on our ability to protect and enforce our trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights. We attempt to protect our intellectual property under copyright, trade secret, patent and trademark laws, and through a combination of confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other methods, all of which offer only limited protection. 
 
 We primarily rely on our unpatented proprietary technology and trade secrets. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and trade secrets, unauthorized parties may attempt to misappropriate, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use them. The contractual provisions that we enter into with employees, consultants, partners, vendors and customers may not prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights. Moreover, policing unauthorized use of our technologies, solutions and intellectual property is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States and where mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be weak. We may be unable to determine the extent of any unauthorized use or infringement of our solutions, technologies or intellectual property rights. 
 
 The process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner, if at all. We may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations and may choose not to pursue patent protection in certain jurisdictions. 
 
 Furthermore, it is possible that our patent applications may not result in granted patents, that the scope of our issued patents will be limited or not provide the coverage originally sought, that our issued patents will not provide us with any competitive advantages, or that our patents and other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative processes or litigation. In addition, issuance of a patent does not guarantee that we have an absolute right to practice the patented invention. As a result, we may not be able to obtain adequate patent protection or to enforce our issued patents effectively. 
 
 From time to time, legal action by us may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense, time and effort required to create the innovative solutions that have enabled us to be successful to date. 
 
 Assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and harm our business and operating results. 
 
 Patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in our industry. Some companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. Third parties may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us. They may also assert such claims against our customers or channel partners whom we typically indemnify against claims that our solutions infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of third parties. As the numbers of products and competitors in our market increase and overlaps occur, claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase. Any claim of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of intellectual property rights by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business. 
 
 The patent portfolios of our most significant competitors are larger than ours. This disparity may increase the risk that they may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent cross-licenses. In addition, future assertions of patent rights by third parties, and any resulting litigation, may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenues and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection. There can be no assurance that we will not be found to infringe or otherwise violate any third-party intellectual property rights or to have done so in the past. 
 
 An adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to: 

pay substantial damages, including treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed a third party s patents or copyrights; 

cease making, licensing or using solutions that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property of others; 

expend additional development resources to attempt to redesign our solutions or otherwise develop non-infringing technology, which may not be successful; 

enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or intellectual property rights; and 

indemnify our partners and other third parties. 

In addition, royalty or licensing agreements, if required or desirable, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may require significant royalty payments and other expenditures. Some licenses may also be non-exclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. Any of the foregoing events could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Governmental export or import controls could subject us to liability if we violate them or limit our ability to compete in foreign markets. 
 
 Our solutions are subject to U.S. export controls, specifically, the Export Administration Regulations and economic sanctions enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. We incorporate encryption technology into certain of our solutions. These encryption solutions and the underlying technology may be exported only with the required export authorizations, including by license, a license exception or other appropriate government authorizations. U.S. export controls may require submission of an encryption registration, product classification and/or annual or semi-annual reports. Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports of encryption products, or our failure to obtain required import or export authorization for our solutions, when applicable, could harm our international sales and adversely affect our revenues. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the export of our solutions, including with respect to new releases of our solutions, may create delays in the introduction of our solutions in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our solutions throughout their globally-distributed systems or, in some cases, prevent the export of our solutions to some countries altogether. In addition, various countries regulate the import of our appliance-based solutions and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute solutions or could limit our customers ability to implement our solutions in those countries. Any new export or import restrictions, new legislation or shifting approaches in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our solutions by existing customers with international operations, declining adoption of our solutions by new customers with international operations and decreased revenues. If we fail to comply with export and import regulations, we may be fined or other penalties could be imposed, including denial of certain export privileges. 
 
 If we are required to collect higher sales and use or other taxes on the solutions we sell, we may be subject to liability for past sales and our future sales may decrease. 
 
 Taxing jurisdictions, including state and local entities, have differing rules and regulations governing sales and use or other taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. In particular, the applicability of sales taxes to our subscription services in various jurisdictions is unclear. It is possible that we could face sales tax audits and that our liability for these taxes could exceed our estimates as tax authorities could still assert that we are obligated to collect additional amounts as taxes from our customers and remit those taxes to those authorities. We could also be subject to audits with respect to state and international jurisdictions for which we may not have accrued tax liabilities. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales or other taxes on our services in jurisdictions where we have not historically done so and do not accrue for sales taxes could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, discourage customers from purchasing our solutions or otherwise harm our business and operating results. 
 
 Changes in our income tax provision or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our operating results. We could be subject to additional taxes. 
 
 We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our tax rate is affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses and excess tax benefits arising from stock-based compensation, other tax benefits and credits, and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Increases in our effective tax rate could harm our operating results. 
 
 Additionally, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide tax provisions. During the ordinary course of business, there are many activities and transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our tax obligations and effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations, including those relating to income tax nexus, by recognizing tax losses or lower than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The United States introduced a new 1 excise tax on share repurchases occurring on or after January 1, 2023 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. The amount of share repurchases subject to the excise tax will be reduced by the fair market value of any shares issued during the taxable year. We do not expect this provision to have a material impact to our results of operations. We may be audited in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional taxes, sales taxes and value-added taxes against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any tax audits or litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which a determination is made.

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock 
 
 Market volatility may affect our stock price and the value of an investment in our common stock and could subject us to litigation. 
 
 The trading price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot predict or control, including: 

announcements of new solutions, services or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors; 

fluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of securities of similar companies; 

general market conditions and overall fluctuations in U.S. equity markets; 

variations in our operating results, or the operating results of our competitors; 

changes in our financial guidance or securities analysts estimates of our financial performance; 

changes in accounting principles; 

sales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders; 

additions or departures of any of our key personnel; 

announcements related to litigation; 

changing legal or regulatory developments in the United States and other countries; and 

discussion of us or our stock price by the financial press and in online investor communities. 

In addition, the stock market in general, and the stocks of technology companies such as ours in particular, have experienced substantial price and volume volatility that is often seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company after a period of volatility in the trading price of its common stock. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Any securities litigation claims brought against us could result in substantial expenses and the diversion of our management s attention from our business. 
 
 Our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance. 
 
 From time to time, we have released, and may continue to release, guidance in our quarterly earnings conference calls, quarterly earnings releases, or otherwise, regarding our future performance that represents our management's estimates as of the date of release. This guidance, which includes forward-looking statements, has been and will be based on projections prepared by our management. These projections are not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our registered public accountants nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the projections. Accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to the projections. 
 
 Projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We intend to state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to imply that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such third parties. 
 
 Guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results may vary from our guidance and the variations may be material. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our common stock. 
 
 Any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this Risk Factors section in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could result in our actual operating results being different from our guidance, and the differences may be adverse and material.

Future sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline. 
 
 The market price of shares of our common stock could decline as a result of substantial sales of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, employees and significant stockholders, a large number of shares of our common stock becoming available for sale, or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 37 .4 million shares of our common stock outstanding. 
 
 In addition, as of December 31, 2022, there were approximately 1.8 million options and 1.1 million restricted stock units outstanding. If such options are exercised and restricted stock units are released, these additional shares will become available for sale. As of December 31, 2022, we had an aggregate of 2.4 million shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under our Restated 2012 Equity Incentive Plan and 0.6 million shares reserved for future purchase under our 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance. If a large number of these shares are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock. 
 
 We cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance stockholder value, and any share repurchases we make could affect the price of our common stock. 
 
 On February 12, 2018, we announced that our board of directors had authorized a 100.0 million repurchase program. On each of October 30, 2018, October 30, 2019, May 7, 2020, February 10, 2021 and February 9, 2023, we announced that our board of directors had authorized an increase of 100.0 million, and on each of November 3, 2021 and May 4, 2022, we announced that our board of directors had authorized an increase of 200.0 million to the share repurchase program, resulting in an aggregate authorization of 1.0 billion to date 900.0 million as of December 31, 2022). Although our board of directors authorized the share repurchase program, we are not obligated to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. The share repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock, increase volatility and diminish our cash reserves. In addition, it may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the price of our common stock. Finally, our share repurchases in 2023 will be subject to a new 1 excise tax introduced in the Inflation Reduction Act. The amount of share repurchases subject to the excise tax will be reduced by the fair market value of any shares issues during the taxable year. We do not expect this provision to have a material impact to our results of operations. During the year ended December 31 , 2022, w e repurchased 2.5 mil lion shares of our common stock for approximately 317.3 million. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 154.5 million remained available for share repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase program. 
 
 We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and therefore any returns will be limited to the value of our stock. 
 
 We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the value of their stock. 
 
 Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. 
 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. These provisions include: 

authorizing blank check preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock, which would increase the number of outstanding shares and could thwart a takeover attempt; 

a classified board of directors whose members can only be dismissed for cause; 

the prohibition on actions by written consent of our stockholders; 

the limitation on who may call a special meeting of stockholders; 

the establishment of advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings; and 

the requirement of at least two-thirds of the outstanding capital stock to amend any of the foregoing second through fifth provisions. 

In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15 of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain greater value for stockholders by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer rejected by our board of directors were considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.

General Risk Factors 
 
 Disruptive technologies could gain wide adoption and supplant our cloud-based IT, security and compliance solutions, thereby weakening our sales and harming our results of operations. 
 
 The introduction of products and services embodying new technologies could render our existing solutions obsolete or less attractive to customers. Our business could be harmed if new IT, security and compliance technologies are widely adopted. We may not be able to successfully anticipate or adapt to changing technology or customer requirements on a timely basis, or at all. If we fail to keep up with technological changes or to convince our customers and potential customers of the value of our solutions even in light of new technologies, our business could be harmed and our revenues may decline. 
 
 We may not maintain profitability in the future. 
 
 We may not be able to sustain or increase our growth or maintain profitability in the future. We plan to continue to invest in our infrastructure, new solutions, research and development and sales and marketing, and as a result, we cannot assure you that we will maintain profitability. We may incur losses in the future for a number of reasons, including without limitation, the other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, we may encounter unforeseen operating expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may result in losses in future periods. If our revenue growth does not meet our expectations in future periods, our financial performance may be harmed and we may not again achieve or maintain profitability in the future. 
 
 Forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the markets in which we compete achieve the forecasted growth, there can be no assurance that our business will grow at similar rates, or at all. 
 
 Growth forecasts relating to the expected growth in the market for IT, security and compliance and other markets are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates which may prove to be inaccurate. Even if these markets experience the forecasted growth, we may not grow our business at similar rates, or at all. Our growth is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, forecasts of market growth should not be taken as indicative of our future growth. 
 
 Our financial results are based in part on our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies. These estimates or judgments may prove to be incorrect, which could harm our operating results and result in a decline in our stock price. 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section titled Part I, Item 2 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, accounting for income taxes and stock-based compensation. 
 
 Changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse and unexpected revenue fluctuations and impact our reported results of operations. 
 
 We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. A change in these accounting standards or practices could harm our operating results and could have a significant effect on our reporting of transactions and reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may harm our operating results or require that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls or the way we conduct our business. 
 
 If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired. 
 
 As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Stock Market. To continue to comply with the requirements of being a public company, we may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing additional internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff. 
 
 Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Any failure to maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their improvement, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports we file with the SEC under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. While we were able to assert in our Annual Report on Form 10-K that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022, we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods. If we are unable to assert in any future reporting period that our internal control over financial reporting is effective (or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls), investors may lose confidence in our operating results and our stock price could decline. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market.

 Legal Proceedings 

From time to time the Company may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. As of December 31, 2022, there has not been at least a reasonable possibility that the Company has incurred a material loss from any ongoing legal proceedings, individually or taken together. However, litigation is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company's control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, the Company could incur significant charges related to legal matters which could have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

 Holders of Record 
 
 As of February 14, 2023, there were approximately 52 holders of record of our common stock.

Any future determination to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should carefully review and consider the information regarding our financial condition and results of operations set forth under Part I-Item 7 (Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 22, 2022, for an understanding of our results of operations and liquidity discussions and analysis comparing fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2020, which information is hereby incorporated by reference. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, as discussed in "Forward-Looking Statements" in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Factors that could cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those described in the section titled "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We are a pioneer and leading provider of a cloud-based platform delivering IT, security and compliance solutions that enable organizations to identify security risks to their IT infrastructures, help protect their IT systems and applications from ever-evolving cyber-attacks and achieve compliance with internal policies and external regulations. Our cloud solutions address the growing security and compliance complexities and risks that are amplified by the dissolving boundaries between internal and external IT infrastructures and web environments, the rapid adoption of cloud computing, containers and serverless IT models, and the proliferation of geographically dispersed IT assets. Our integrated suite of IT, security and compliance solutions delivered on our Qualys Cloud Platform enables our customers to identify and manage their IT assets, collect and analyze large amounts of IT security data, discover and prioritize vulnerabilities, recommend and implement remediation actions and verify the implementation of such actions. Organizations use our integrated suite of solutions to cost-effectively obtain a unified view of their IT asset inventory as well as security and compliance posture across globally-distributed IT infrastructures as our solution offers a single platform for information technology, information security, application security, endpoint, developer security and cloud teams. 
 
 We were founded and incorporated in December 1999 with a vision of transforming the way organizations secure and protect their IT infrastructure and applications and initially launched our first cloud solution, Vulnerability Management (VM), in 2000. As VM gained acceptance, we introduced additional solutions to help customers manage increasing IT, security and compliance requirements. Today, the suite of solutions that we offer on our cloud platform and refer to as the Qualys Cloud Apps helps our customers protect a range of assets across on-premises, endpoints, cloud, containers, and mobile environments. These Cloud Apps address and include: 

IT Security: Vulnerability Management (VM), Vulnerability Management, Detection and Response (VMDR), Threat Protection (TP), Continuous Monitoring (CM), Patch Management (PM), Multi-Vector Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), Certificate Assessment (CRA), SaaS Detection and Response (SaaSDR), Secure Enterprise Mobility (SEM), Custom Assessment and Remediation (CAR), Context Extended Detection and Response (XDR), Network Detection and Response (NDR); 

Compliance: Policy Compliance (PC), Security Configuration Assessment (SCA), PCI Compliance (PCI), File Integrity Monitoring (FIM), Security Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ), Out of-Band Configuration Assessment (OCA); 

Web Application Security: Web Application Scanning (WAS), Web Application Firewall (WAF); 

Asset Management: Global AssetView (GAV), Cybersecurity Asset Management (CSAM), Certificate Inventory (CRI); and 

Cloud/Container Security: Cloud Inventory (CI), Cloud Security Assessment (CSA), Container Security (CS). 

We provide our solutions through a software-as-a-service model, primarily with renewable annual subscriptions. These subscriptions require customers to pay a fee in order to access each of our cloud solutions. We generally invoice our customers for the entire subscription amount at the start of the subscription term, and the invoiced amounts are treated as deferred revenues and are recognized ratably over the term of each subscription. We continue to experience revenue growth from our existing customers as they renew and purchase additional subscriptions, as well as from the addition of new customers to our cloud platform. 
 
 We market and sell our solutions to enterprises, government entities and small and medium-sized businesses across a broad range of industries, including education, financial services, government, healthcare, insurance, manufacturing, media, retail, technology and utilities. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, 60 , 61 and 63 , respectively, of our revenues were derived from customers in the United States based on our customers' billing addresses. We sell our solutions to enterprises and government entities primarily through our field sales force and to small and medium-sized businesses through our inside sales force. We generate a significant portion of sales through our channel partners, including managed security service providers, value-added resellers and consulting firms in the United States and internationally.

Impacts of Current Macroeconomic Environment 

The uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic factors in the U.S. and globally characterized by COVID-19, the supply chain environment, inflationary pressure, rising interest rates, labor shortages, significant volatility of global markets and geopolitical conflicts have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our long-term business and could lead to further economic disruption and expose us to greater risk as our current and potential customers may reduce or eliminate their overall spending on IT security. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Key Components of Results of Operations 
 
 Revenues 
 
 We derive revenues from the sale of subscriptions to our IT, security and compliance solutions, which are delivered on our cloud platform. Subscriptions to our solutions allow customers to access our cloud-based IT, security and compliance solutions through a unified, web-based interface. Customers generally enter into one-year renewable subscriptions. The subscription fee entitles the customer to an unlimited number of scans for a specified number of devices or web applications and, if requested by a customer as part of their subscription, a specified number of physical or virtual scanner appliances. Our physical and virtual scanner appliances are requested by certain customers as part of their subscriptions in order to scan IT infrastructures within their firewalls and do not function without, and are not sold separately from, subscriptions for our solutions. In some cases, we also provide certain computer equipment used to extend our Qualys Cloud Platform into our customers' private cloud environment. Customers are required to return physical scanner appliances and computer equipment if they do not renew their subscriptions. 
 
 We typically invoice our customers for the entire subscription amount at the start of the subscription term. Invoiced amounts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as accounts receivable or as cash when collected, and as deferred revenues until earned and recognized ratably over the subscription period. Accordingly, deferred revenues represent the amount billed to customers that has not yet been earned or recognized as revenues, pursuant to subscriptions entered into in current and prior periods. 
 
 Cost of Revenues 
 
 Cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel expenses, comprised of salaries, benefits, performance-based compensation and stock-based compensation, for employees who operate our shared cloud platforms and provide support services to our customers. Other expenses include depreciation of shared cloud platform equipment, physical scanner appliances and computer hardware provided to certain customers as part of their subscriptions, expenses related to the use of third-party shared cloud platforms and cloud infrastructures, amortization of software and license fees, amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, maintenance support, fees paid to contractors who supplement or support our operations center personnel and overhead allocations. We expect to continue to make capital investments to expand and support our shared cloud platform and cloud infrastructure operations, which will increase the cost of revenues in absolute dollars. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Research and Development 
 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses, comprised of salaries, benefits, performance-based compensation and stock-based compensation, for our research and development teams. Other expenses include third-party contractor fees, software and license fees, amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions and overhead allocations. We expect to continue to devote resources to research and development in an effort to continuously improve our existing solutions as well as develop new solutions and capabilities and expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars.

Sales and Marketing 
 
 Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses, comprised of salaries, benefits, sales commissions, performance-based compensation and stock-based compensation for our worldwide sales and marketing teams. Other expenses include marketing and promotional events, lead-generation marketing programs, public relations, travel, software licenses and overhead allocations. Sales commissions related to new business and upsells are capitalized as an asset. We amortize the capitalized commission cost as a selling expense on a straight-line basis over a period of five years. We expense sales commissions related to contract renewals as incurred. Our new sales personnel are typically not immediately productive, and the resulting increase in sales and marketing expenses we incur when we add new personnel may not result in increased revenues if these new sales personnel fail to become productive. The timing of our hiring of sales personnel, or the participation in new marketing events or programs, and the rate at which these generate incremental revenues, may affect our future operating results. We expect to continue to invest in additional sales personnel worldwide and also in more marketing programs to support new solutions on our platform, which will increase sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses, comprised of salaries, benefits, performance-based compensation and stock-based compensation for our executive, finance and accounting, IT, legal and human resources teams, as well as professional services, fees, software licenses and overhead allocations. We expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars, as we continue to add personnel and incur professional services to support our growth and compliance with legal requirements. 
 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 
 Our other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest and investment income from our short-term and long-term marketable securities and foreign exchange gains and losses, the majority of which result from fluctuations between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro, British Pound ("GBP") and Indian Rupee ("INR"). 
 
 Income Tax Provision 
 
 We are subject to federal, state and foreign income taxes for jurisdictions in which we operate, and we use estimates in determining our income tax provision and deferred tax assets. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to income taxes in the local countries at rates which were generally similar to the U.S. statutory tax rate.

Revenues increased by 78.6 million in 2022 compared to 2021, driven by increased demand for our subscription services by our end customers. Of the total increase of 78.6 million in revenue from 2021 to 2022, 80 was from revenues from customers existing at or prior to December 31, 2021, and the remaining 20 was from new customers added in 2022. Of the total increase of 78.6 million, 51 was from customers in the United States and the remaining 49 was from customers in foreign countries. In 2022, 58 of total revenue was direct and 42 of total revenue was through partners. Of the total increase of 78.6 million, 53 was direct and the remaining 47 was from partners. With our strong market position driving further demand for our solutions, we expect revenue growth from new and existing customers to continue.

Key Operating and Non-GAAP Financial Performance Metrics 
 
 In addition to measures of financial performance presented in our consolidated financial statements, we monitor the key metrics set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and assess operational efficiencies. 
 
 Net Dollar Expansion Rate 
 
 We evaluate our ability to retain and grow existing customers by assessing our net dollar expansion rate on a last twelve months, or LTM, basis. This metric is used to appropriately manage resources and customer retention and expansion. We calculate the net dollar expansion rate on a foreign exchange neutral basis by dividing a numerator by a denominator, each defined as follows: 
 
 Denominator: To calculate our net dollar expansion rate as of the end of a reporting period, we first determine the annual recurring revenue, or ARR, from all active subscriptions as of the last day of the same reporting period in the prior year. This represents recurring payments that we expect to receive in the next 12-month period from the cohort of customers that existed on the last day of the same reporting period in the prior year. 
 
 Numerator: We measure the ARR for that same cohort of customers representing all active subscriptions as of the end of the reporting period, using the same foreign exchange rate from the prior year. 
 
 Our net dollar expansion rates were 109 and 108 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 We monitor Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to analyze our financial results and believe that it is useful to investors, as a supplement to U.S. GAAP measures, in evaluating our ongoing operational performance and enhancing an overall understanding of our past financial performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA helps illustrate underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the income or expenses that we exclude in Adjusted EBITDA. Furthermore, we use this measure to establish budgets and operational goals for managing our business and evaluating our performance. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our recurring core business operating results over multiple periods with other companies in our industry. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income before (1) other (income) expense, net, which includes interest income, interest expense and other income and expense, (2) income tax provision (benefit), (3) depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, (4) amortization of intangible assets, (5) stock-based compensation and (6) non-recurring expenses that do not reflect ongoing costs of operating the business. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect certain cash and non-cash charges that are recurring; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income tax payments that reduce cash available to us; 

Adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, although these are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future; and 

Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently or not at all, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. 

Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered alongside other financial performance measures, including revenues, net income, cash flows from operating activities and our financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 The following unaudited table presents the reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of December 31, 2022 , our principal source of liquidity was cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 380.5 million, including 52.7 million of cash held outside of the United States. The following summary of cash flows for the periods indicated has been derived from our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report:

Operating Activities 
 
 In 2022 , we generated 177.2 million of cash from our net income, as adjusted for non-cash items mainly related to stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense and deferred taxes, as compared to 169.6 million in 2021. In addition, we also generated 21.7 million of cash from working capital change in 2022, of which 11.8 million was related to net increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable as a result of our continued growth in billing and collection, and 9.9 million was due to lower prepaid expenses and an increase in payables and accrued liabilities in line with our business. In 2021, we generated 31.0 million of cash from working capital change, of which 37.4 million was related to net increase in deferred revenue and accounts receivable as a result of our continued growth in billing and collection, partially offset by higher prepaid income taxes of 6.9 million. 
 
 Net cash taxes paid, excluding prepaid income taxes, during 2022 were approximately 20.0 million higher compared to 2021, primarily due to the new tax law requiring mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses effective January 1, 2022. Previously, these expenses could be deducted in the year incurred. The near term increase in cash tax will be offset by a decrease in cash taxes in future years when the capitalized expenses are amortized for tax purposes. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 In 2022, we generated 169.0 million of cash in marketable securities investment, used 15.4 million of cash in capital expenditures mainly related to computer equipment to support our growth and development and 8.6 million of cash to acquire certain technology assets, as compared to 4.5 million of cash used in marketable securities investment, 24.4 million of cash used in capital expenditures and 1.1 million of cash used for acquisition of technology assets in 2021. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 In 2022, we used 317.3 million of cash for share repurchase and 17.6 million of cash in payment of employee withholding taxes upon vesting of restricted stock units and received 24.5 million of proceeds from employee exercise of stock options, as compared to 130.0 million of cash used for share repurchase, 27.8 million of cash used in payment of employee withholding taxes upon vesting of restricted stock units and 50.0 million of cash received from employee exercise of stock options in 2021. Net cash used in financing activities are expected to be lower in 2023 due to expected lower volume of share repurchase. 
 
 We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and our expected cash flow generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months and beyond. We do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. However, if we repatriate these funds, we could be subject to foreign withholding taxes. 
 
 Our material cash requirements mainly include the following contractual and other obligations: 

Our operating lease obligations to make payments under our non-cancelable lease agreements for our facilities and shared cloud platforms. We had fixed operating lease payment obligations of 46.4 million as of December 31, 2022, with 14.9 million expected to be paid within the next 12 months. 

Cash outflow for capital expenditures in 2023 is expected to be in a range of 18.0 million to 25.0 million. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, the timing, type and extent of our spending on research and development efforts, international expansion and investment in shared cloud platforms and cloud infrastructures. We may also seek to invest in or acquire complementary businesses or technologies. 

Other non-cancelable purchase obligations related to cloud infrastructures and other service providers totaled 77.1 million, of which 25.6 million is expected to be paid with in the next 12 months. 

We expect to continue to use cash to repurchase shares in 2023 under our share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors on February 5, 2018. As of December 31, 2022, our board of directors had authorized an aggregate amount of 900.0 million for repurchases under our share repurchase program, of which approximately 154.5 million remained available. Shares will be repurchased from time to time on the open market in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act of 1934, including pursuant to a pre-set trading plan adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. 
 
 On February 9, 2023 , we announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 100.0 million under our share repurchase program, increasing the total amount of authorized repurchase to 1.0 billion.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 - The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based on historical and anticipated results and trends that we believe represent our best estimate under the circumstances. However, as accounting estimates are subject to inherent uncertainty, our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Significant assumptions, judgments and estimates are involved in determining our provision for (benefit from) income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision for income taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income (loss), expectations of future income, our interpretation of current tax laws, our business, and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Our judgments also include anticipating the tax positions we will record in the financial statements before preparing and filing the tax returns. Our estimates and assumptions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified or resolved. Changes in our business and tax laws or our interpretation of those, and developments in current and future tax audits, could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 
 
 The assessment of tax effects of our uncertain tax positions in our financial statements involves significant judgment in interpreting complex and ambiguous tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices, determining the probability of various possible settlement outcomes, evaluating the litigation process based on tax authority behaviors in similar cases, and estimating the likelihood that another taxing authority could review the respective tax position. These judgments are inherently challenging and subjective because a taxing authority may change its behavior at any time. We must also determine when it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the 12 months after each fiscal year-end. We reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax laws, effectively settled issues under audit, the potential for interest and penalties, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision that could be material in the future. 
 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 
 We recognize the fair value of our employee stock options and restricted stock units, including performance-based restricted stock units, over the requisite service period. The fair value of each stock option is estimated on date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of employee stock options requires the use of subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock option and stock price volatility. The recognition of expenses for performance based restricted stock units requires us to estimate the probability that the performance condition will be achieved and the number of awards that will vest are adjusted accordingly at each reporting period. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of employee stock options and estimating the probability of achievement of performance metrics represent management s best estimates, which require significant judgment and involve inherent uncertainties. If factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. 

Item 7A. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

We have domestic and international operations and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate, foreign exchange and inflation risks, as well as risks relating to changes in the general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we monitor the financial condition of our large customers and limit credit exposure by collecting subscription fees in advance. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 
 Our results of operations and cash flows have been and will continue to be subject to fluctuations because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro, GBP, INR and Canadian Dollar ("C ") , th e currencies of countries where we currently have our most significant international operations. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to forecasted subscription revenue, operating expenses and foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities. As of December 31, 2022, we had designated cash flow hedge forward contracts with notional amounts of 37.4 million, 10.4 million and Rs.3,411.0 million and non-designated forward contracts with notional amounts of 40.2 million, 16.2 million, Rs.484.0 million and C 3.8 million . With our hedging strategy applied, the effect of an immediate 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates would not be material to our financial condition, operating results or cash flows. 
 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 
 We had 380.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities as of December 31, 2022. Cash and cash equivalents include cash held in banks, highly liquid money market funds and commercial paper. Marketable securities consist of fixed-income U.S. Treasury and government agency securities, commercial paper corporate bonds, asset-backed securities and foreign government securities. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of principal and support of our liquidity requirements. We do not invest for trading or speculative purposes. Our marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates, which may affect the interest income we earn and the fair market value. As of December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rate would result in a decrease in the fair value of our marketable securities by 1.0 million.

 Board of Directors and Stockholders 
 
 Qualys, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the financial statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Qualys, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ).

 As described further in Note 12 to the financial statements, the Company records income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. We identified the tax effects of temporary and permanent differences related to stock-based compensation as a critical audit matter. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that the tax effects of temporary and permanent differences are a critical audit matter are that auditing the application of executive compensation rules requires significant technical expertise, the Company is generating excess tax deductions as a result of stock-based compensation and the stock-based compensation calculation is complex due to the required recordkeeping. Our audit procedures related to the tax effects of temporary and permanent differences related to stock-based compensation included the following, among others. 
 
 Involved an employee compensation specialist to assess the application of stock-based compensation tax rules. 
 Obtained management s permanent and temporary provision calculation and tied out inputs to supporting equity documentation. 
 Tested the completeness and accuracy of the calculation of permanent and temporary differences. 
 Determined that the ending gross temporary difference agreed to the supporting equity documentation. 
 We tested the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company s calculation of the tax effects covering the validation of the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the analysis.

 Opinion on internal control over financial reporting 
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Qualys, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by COSO. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, and our report dated February 23, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Basis for opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

million, of which million is related to cash held in escrow as part of the Blue Hexagon acquisition and million in the form of a letter of credit issued to the landlord of the Company's California headquarter office lease as security deposit. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has restricted cash balance of 1.2 million in the form of a letter of credit issued to the landlord of the Company s California headquarter office lease as security deposit. 
 
 Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair market value. Short-term and long-term marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale debt securities (AFS debt securities) and are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses in fair value of the AFS debt securities are reported in other comprehensive income (loss). When the AFS debt securities are sold, cost is based on the specific identification method, and the realized gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. AFS debt securities are reviewed quarterly for impairment. An investment is considered impaired when its fair value is below its amortized cost. Declines in fair value from amortized cost for AFS debt securities that the company intends to sell or will more likely than not be required to sell before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis are charged to other income (expense), net in the period in which the loss occurs. Otherwise, the credit loss component of the impairment is recorded as allowance for credit losses with an offsetting entry charged to other income (expense), net, while the remaining loss is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). 

million, million and million as of December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 
 million in preferred stock of a privately-held company (the Investee ). The fair value of the investment is not readily available, and there are no quoted market prices for the investment. The Company elected the measurement alternative to account for the investment at cost less impairment and will measure the investment at fair value when the Company identifies observable price changes. The investment is assessed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. No impairment has been incurred related to the investment. The investment is included in other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company has not received any dividends from the investment. 
 
 In 2019, the Company made an advance payment of million to the Investee for it to perform certain technology development work, which should either be settled in the form of royalty fee charges when the technology materializes and is licensed to the Company or, otherwise, should be repaid to the Company in cash. The advance payment was recorded in other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021, the technology has not been developed and the Company decided to no longer pursue the development of the technology or the collection of the advanced amount. Accordingly, the entire amount of the advance payment was written off and recorded in the general and administrative expense during the year ended December 31, 2021. 

impairment of long-lived assets. 

The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps: 
 
 Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; 
 
 Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; 
 
 Determination of the transaction price 
 
 Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 
 
 Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation. 

At the inception of a customer contract, the Company makes an assessment as to that customer's ability to pay for the services provided. The Company assesses collectability based on several factors, including credit worthiness of the customer along with past transaction history. In addition, the Company performs periodic evaluations of its customers financial condition. 
 
 Most of the Company s revenue contracts are subscription based and contain a single performance obligation. The subscription contracts typically do not offer to the customers any future rights that would constitute material rights. Contract prices are generally composed of fixed consideration for a specific period of time as the Company in general does not offer refunds, volume rebates, customer loyalty programs or other forms of customer incentive payments. In limited situations, contract prices are contingent on future events, such as actual usage during the contract terms, which are accounted for as variable consideration and estimated based on the most likely amount of consideration that the Company is expected to be entitled to. Estimates are included in the contract price to the extent that it is considered probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Such estimates are made at contract inception and updated periodically when additional information becomes available. A cumulative catch-up adjustment is made when there is a change in the estimate of variable consideration. 
 
 As the Company's cloud-based subscription services are delivered to customers electronically and over time, revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract terms. When physical equipment is provided to the customers as part of the subscription service contract, the Company applies the practical expedient allowed under ASC 842 Leases to combine lease and nonlease components as a combined component to be accounted for under ASC 606, as the Company determined that the software subscription is the predominant component of the combined components. Therefore, the Company recognizes revenue for the physical equipment ratably over the related subscription period. 
 
 Contract modifications happen when there is an upsell, where the customers subsequently enter into contract with the Company to purchase additional product offerings or additional scans for additional devices. Contract modifications related to upsells are accounted for prospectively. 
 
 Deferred revenues consist of customer contracts billed or cash received that will be recognized in the future under subscriptions existing at the balance sheet date. The current portion of deferred revenues represents amounts that are expected to be recognized within one year of the balance sheet date. 
 
 Costs of shipping and handling charges incurred by the Company associated with physical scanner appliances and other computer equipment are included in cost of revenues. Sales taxes and other taxes collected from customers to be remitted to government authorities are excluded from revenues. 
 
 Incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract, which consist of sales commissions primarily for new business and upsells, are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the customer relationship if renewals are expected and the renewal commission is not commensurate with the initial commission. The Company elected the practical expedient to expense commissions on renewals where the specific anticipated contract term amortization period is one year or less. The Company amortizes the capitalized commission cost as a selling expense on a straight-line basis over a period of five years. The Company classifies deferred commissions as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when it expects to recognize the expense. The current and noncurrent portions of deferred commissions are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other noncurrent assets, respectively, in its consolidated balance sheets.

The Company had the ability and intent to hold all marketable securities that were in an unrealized loss position until recovery of the amortized cost basis. The Company considered the extent to which fair value was less than amortized cost basis and conditions related to security s industry and geography and changes to the ratings, if any, and concluded the decline in fair value compared to carrying value was not related to credit loss.

Derivative Financial Instruments 
 
 Designated cash flow hedges 
 
 The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risk of variability in future cash flow due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation from certain forecasted subscription revenue orders billed in GBP and Euro and operation expenses incurred in INR, which are designated as cash flow hedges. Hedge effectiveness is assessed at inception and at each reporting period utilizing regression analysis. Unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses related to those designated cash flow hedge contracts are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") and will be reclassified into revenues or operating expenses, respectively, in the same periods when the hedged transactions are recognized in earnings. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022 , a net amount of unrealized gains of million before tax on the foreign currency forward contracts for GBP and Euro reported in AOCI is expected to be reclassified into revenue within the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2022 , a net amount of unrealized loss of million before tax on the foreign currency forward contracts for INR reported in AOCI is expected to be reclassified into operating expenses within the next 12 months. 
 
 Non-designated forward contracts 
 
 The Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities, which are not designated as cash flow hedges. Unrealized foreign exchange gain or losses related to the non-designated forward contracts are recorded in other income (expenses), net and offset the foreign exchange gain or loss on the underlying net monetary assets or liabilities. 
 
 The following summarizes the fair value of derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 :

Derivative transactions are measured in terms of the notional amount. However, this amount is not recorded on the balance sheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of the derivative instruments. The notional amount is generally not exchanged, and is used only as the underlying basis on which the value of foreign currency exchange payments under these contracts is determined. The following summarizes the notional amounts of our outstanding derivatives: 

Foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments

The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at gross fair values in the consolidated balance sheets. However, under the master netting agreements with the respective counterparties of the foreign exchange contracts, subject to applicable requirements, the Company is allowed to net settle transactions of the same currency with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. The potential offset to both assets and liabilities under the right of set-off associated with the Company's foreign currency exchange contracts are immaterial as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The derivatives held by the Company are not subject to any credit contingent features negotiated with its counterparties. The Company is not required to pledge nor is entitled to receive cash collateral related to the above contracts. The counterparties to these derivatives are large, global financial institutions that the Company believes are creditworthy, and therefore, it does not consider the risk of counterparty nonperformance to be material.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , physical scanner appliances and other computer equipment that are or will be subject to leases by customers had a net carrying value of million and 5.3 million, respectively, including assets that had not been placed in service of million and 1.3 million, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expenses relating to property and equipment were million, million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022 , 2021 and 2020 , respectively. Assets under finance leases were acquired upon completion of lease term and placed within computer equipment as of December 31, 2022. 

million and million were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , respectively, which amounts were included in the deferred revenue balances of million and million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 , respectively. 
 
 The Company's payment terms vary by the type and location of its customers. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. In certain circumstances, based on the credit quality of the customer, the Company requires payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer. 
 
 The following table sets forth the expected revenue from all remaining performance obligations as of December 31, 2022 :

Revenues allocated to remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price of noncancelable orders for which service has not been performed, which include deferred revenue and the amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenues in future periods from open contracts and excludes unexercised renewals. The Company applied the short-term contract exemption to exclude the remaining performance obligations that are part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less. 
 
 From time to time, the Company enters into contracts with customers that extend beyond one year, with certain of its customers electing to pay for more than one year of services upon contract execution. The Company concluded that these contracts did not contain a financing component. 
 
 Revenues by sales channel are as follows: 

Partner 
 Total 

The Company utilizes partners to enable and accelerate the adoption of its cloud platform by increasing its distribution capabilities and market awareness of its cloud platform as well as by targeting geographic regions outside the reach of its direct sales force. The Company's channel partners maintain relationships with their customers throughout the territories in which they operate and provide their customers with services and third -party solutions to help meet those customers evolving security and compliance requirements. As such, these partners may offer the Company's IT security and compliance solutions in conjunction with one or more of their own products or services and act as a conduit through which the Company can connect with these prospective customers to offer its solutions. For sales involving a channel partner, the channel partner engages with the prospective customer directly and involves the Company's sales team as needed to assist in developing and closing an order. When a channel partner secures a sale, the Company sells the associated subscription to the channel partner who in turn resells the subscription to the customer. Sales to channel partners are made at a discount and revenues are recorded at this discounted price over the subscription terms. The Company does not have any influence or specific knowledge of its partners' selling terms with their customers. See Note 13, "Segment Information and Information about Geographic Area" for disaggregation of revenue by geographic area. 
 
 Deferred costs to obtain contracts are as follows: 

Noncurrent 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 , 2021 and 2020 , the Company recognized million, million and million, respectively, of amortization expense relating to deferred costs to obtain contracts in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of operations. During the same periods, there was impairment loss related to the deferred costs to obtain contracts.

The Company provides disclosure if it is reasonably possible that a loss has been incurred and a range of loss or possible loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount.

Deferred Income Taxes 
 
 Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The components of the Company s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: 

Accrued liabilities 
 Deferred revenues 
 Operating lease liabilities 
 Intangible assets

 Gross deferred tax assets 
 Valuation allowance 
 Total deferred tax assets

 Total deferred tax liabilities 
 Net deferred tax assets 

The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in future periods. The Company regularly assesses the ability to realize its deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more-likely than- not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company weighs all available positive and negative evidence, including its earnings history and results of recent operations, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. Due to the weight of objectively verifiable negative evidence, it is more-likely-than- not that its California deferred tax assets will not be realized as of December 31, 2022 . Additionally, due to a lack of sufficient future income of the appropriate character, certain U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets are not more-likely-than- not to be realized. Accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of million and million against such deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. The increase of million in valuation allowance was mainly associated with the California research and development credit generated during the year ended December 31, 2022 and unrealized loss on available for sale securities that will not likely be realized in the foreseeable future. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022 , the Company had million of state research and development credit carryforwards. State research and development credits do not expire. As of December 31, 2022 , the Company had foreign tax credit carryforwards of million which begin to expire in 2028.

 Total unrecognized tax benefits 

The unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact the income tax provision by million, million and million as of December 31, 2022 , 2021 and 2020 , respectively. The remaining amount would result in the recognition of a corresponding deferred tax asset that is then offset by a full valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2022 , the Company does not believe that its estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. The Company has elected to include interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. The amounts were not material for the years ended December 31, 2022 , 2021 and 2020 . 
 
 The Company files income tax returns in the United States, including various state jurisdictions. The Company s subsidiaries file tax returns in various foreign jurisdictions. The tax years 2001 through 2021 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions in which the Company is subject to tax. The Company is also currently subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions. The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company's tax audits are resolved in a manner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its income tax provision in the period such resolution occurs. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022 , the Company has undistributed earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries that the Company has indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. As a result, the Company has not provided for deferred tax liabilities on those earnings. The Company may be required to pay additional income taxes if the Company repatriates those earnings in the future.

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in the 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the COSO, our management concluded our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by Grant Thornton LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

1. Purpose . The purpose of this 2022 Corporate Bonus Plan (the Plan is to motivate and encourage the employees of Qualys (the Company to achieve its stated goals and to assist the Company in attracting, motivating and retaining employees on a competitive basis. 

2. 

Eligibility 

(a) An officer or employee of the Company is designated as a participant in the Plan Participant and shall be eligible to participate in the Plan if he or she is a regular full- time or regular part-time employee (working greater than 20 hours a week) and he or she is not already participating in a separate Compensation Plan or MBO plan. 

(b) New Hires . New employees hired in the first or second month of a quarter will be eligible to participate in the Plan for that quarter, such participation will be prorated based on the number of days employed in the quarter. 

(c) Termination of Employment. To be eligible for the bonus, the employee must be employed as of the last day of the quarter. 

(d) Absence during Performance Period. If a Participant is absent for a period of more than one-half of the scheduled workdays during a quarter, for any reason, the Participant s bonus payment will be prorated based on the number of days the Participant actually worked compared to the total number of scheduled work days during that quarter. 

3. 

Bonus Criteria 

(a) Bonus Period. The Bonus Plan is effective from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. Each calendar quarter is a separate bonus period. 

(b) Bonus Level. A Participant s level of participation in the Plan is set based on their grade level as determined by the Human Resources Department and is applied to the Participant s base salary as of the last day of that quarter to determine the bonus amount. 

(c) Objective Criteria: The Plan payments will be based on ASV (as defined below), Revenue (as defined below) and Non-GAAP EPS (as defined below). 

(1) ASV . The stated goal is the growth in company-wide bookings as represented by Annual Subscription Value ASV for the current quarter over the same quarter of the prior year. ASV is the sum of one year s worth of subscribed revenues to Qualys for all new, renewal and upsell subscriptions contracted by customers and channel partners in each quarter. ASV is determined by policies and practices administered by the Controller and the final quarterly ASV amount is approved by the CFO. 

(2) Revenue . The stated goal is the growth in company-wide revenue (as determined in accordance with GAAP and set forth in the Company s quarterly and annual financial statements) for the current quarter over the same quarter of the prior year. 

(3) Non-GAAP EPS . The stated goal is Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP EPS is GAAP net income less stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses (except for ordinary course advisory fees), tax adjustments and bonus payments under this Plan divided by weighted average shares (diluted) for the applicable quarter. 

(d) Payout Calculation . A Participant s bonus amount will be equal to the aggregate for each of the applicable objective goals as follows: the payment percentage described below multiplied by weighting percentage for the applicable goal. ASV Growth, Revenue Growth and Non-GAAP EPS shall be the 3 goals and shall be equally weighted. 

 (1) ASV. The payout percentage scales based upon achievement of ASV as described in Section 1 of the Appendix. 

(2) Revenue. The payout percentage scales based upon achievement of Revenue as described in Section 2 of the Appendix. 

(3) Non-GAAP EPS. The payout percentage scales based upon achievement of Non-GAAP EPS as described in Section 3 of the Appendix. 

(e) Bonus Payments. Bonus payments to Participants under this Plan will be made with the first payroll of the second month following the end of the quarter. Bonus payments are gross amounts, meaning that they constitute the full amount and that there will be no other increases (for example, to cover income taxes). The company will deduct from any payment under the Plan the amount of all applicable income and employment taxes, and any other amounts required by law to be withheld or deducted from such payment. None of the payments will be benefits bearing (i.e., the bonus amounts will not be used for purposes of determining any other company-provided benefits or compensation). 

Administration. This Plan shall be administered by the Company s CFO (except with respect to Participants who are the Company s executive officers, in which case the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors will serve as the administrator), who may make and apply such rules deemed desirable or necessary to administer the Plan in the best interests of the Company. All questions of interpretation or application of the Plan may be addressed in writing to the CFO (or as applicable, the Compensation Committee), who shall review each inquiry in good faith, and each such determination shall be final and binding. With the approval of the Compensation Committee, the results with respect to determination of ASV, Revenue, and Non- GAAP EPS will be adjusted to remove the effects of charges for restructurings, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and all items of gain, loss or expense determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or related to the disposal of a segment of a business or related to a change in accounting principle, asset write-downs, litigation, claims, judgments or settlements, the effect of changes in tax law or other such laws or provisions affecting reported results, accruals for reorganization and restructuring programs.
