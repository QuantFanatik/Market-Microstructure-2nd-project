Forward-Looking Statements 

This report contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions, current expectations, estimates and projections about the financial services industry, the
 economy, and Macatawa Bank Corporation. Forward-looking statements are identifiable by words or phrases such as outlook , plan or strategy that an event or trend could , may , should , will , is likely , or is possible or
 probable to occur or continue , has begun or is scheduled or on track or that the Company or its management anticipates , believes , estimates , plans , forecasts , intends , predicts , projects , or expects a particular
 result, or is committed , confident , optimistic or has an opinion that an event will occur, or other words or phrases such as ongoing , future , signs , efforts , tend , exploring , appearing , until , near term , concern ,
 going forward , focus , starting , initiative, trend and variations of such words and similar expressions. Such statements are based upon current beliefs and expectations and involve substantial risks and uncertainties which could cause
 actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These statements include, among others, those related to future levels of earning assets, future composition of our loan portfolio, trends
 in credit quality metrics, future capital levels and capital needs, real estate valuation, future levels of repossessed and foreclosed properties and nonperforming assets, future levels of losses and costs associated with the administration and
 disposition of repossessed and foreclosed properties and nonperforming assets, future levels of loan charge-offs, future levels of other real estate owned, future levels of provisions for loan losses and reserve recoveries, the rate of asset
 dispositions, future dividends, future growth and funding sources, future cost of funds, future liquidity levels, future profitability levels, future interest rate levels, future net interest margin levels, the effects on earnings of changes in
 interest rates, future economic conditions, future effects of new or changed accounting standards, future loss recoveries, loan demand and loan growth, future amounts of unrecognized tax benefits and the future level of other revenue sources.
 Management's determination of the provision and allowance for loan losses, the appropriate carrying value of intangible assets (including deferred tax assets) and other real estate owned, and the fair value of investment securities (including
 whether any impairment on any investment security is temporary or other-than-temporary and the amount of any impairment) involves judgments that are inherently forward-looking. All statements with references to future time periods are
 forward-looking. All of the information concerning interest rate sensitivity is forward-looking. Our ability to sell other real estate owned at its carrying value or at all, successfully implement new programs and initiatives, increase
 efficiencies, maintain our current levels of deposits and other sources of funding, maintain liquidity, respond to declines in collateral values and credit quality, respond to a changing interest rate environment, increase loan volume,
 originate high quality loans, maintain or improve mortgage banking income, realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets, continue payment of dividends and improve profitability is not entirely within our control and is not assured. The future
 effect of changes in the real estate, financial and credit markets and the national and regional economy on the banking industry, generally, and Macatawa Bank Corporation, specifically, are also inherently uncertain. These statements are not
 guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions risk factors that are difficult to predict with regard to timing, extent, likelihood and degree of occurrence. Therefore, actual results and outcomes
 may materially differ from what may be expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. Macatawa Bank Corporation does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that may arise
 after the date of the forward-looking statements.

Risk factors include, but are not limited to, the risk factors described in Item 1A - Risk Factors of this report. These and other factors are representative of the risk factors that may
 emerge and could cause a difference between an ultimate actual outcome and preceding forward-looking statements.

PAR T I

ITEM 1: 

Business.

As used in this report, the terms "we," "us," "our, Macatawa and Company mean Macatawa Bank Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates another
 meaning. The term "Bank" means Macatawa Bank.

Macatawa Bank Corporation is a Michigan corporation, incorporated in 1997, and is a registered bank holding company. It wholly owns Macatawa Bank, a Michigan chartered bank with depository
 accounts insured by the FDIC. The Bank operates twenty-six branch offices and a lending and operational service facility, providing a full range of commercial and consumer banking and trust services in Kent County, Ottawa County, and northern
 Allegan County, Michigan.

At December 31, 2022, we had total assets of 2.91 billion, total loans of 1.18 billion, total deposits of 2.62 billion and shareholders' equity of 247.0 million. We recognized net income
 of 34.7 million in 2022 compared to net income of 29.0 million in 2021. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s and the Bank s risk-based regulatory capital ratios were significantly above those required under the regulatory standards and the
 Bank continued to be categorized as well capitalized at December 31, 2022.

The Company paid a cash dividend of 0.08 per share for each quarter of 2021 and 2022.

The Bank was a participating lender in the Small Business Administration's SBA Paycheck Protection Program PPP ). Fees generated based on the origination of PPP loans were deferred and
 amortized into interest income over the contractual period of 24 months or 60 months, as applicable. Upon SBA forgiveness, unamortized fees were then recognized into interest income.

In 2020:

The Bank originated 1,738 PPP loans totaling 346.7 million in principal.

Fees generated totaled 10.0 million.

765 PPP loans totaling 113.5 million were forgiven.

Total net fees of 5.4 million were recognized.

In 2021:

The Bank originated 1,000 PPP loans totaling 128.1 million in principal.

Fees generated totaled 5.6 million.

1,722 PPP loans totaling 318.4 million were forgiven.

Total net fees of 8.3 million were recognized.

In 2022:

251 PPP loans totaling 43.2 million were forgiven.

Total net fees of 1.3 million were recognized.

As of December 31, 2022, no PPP loans remain outstanding.

We are in an asset-sensitive position, so increases in short-term interest rates have a net positive impact on our net interest income as our interest-earning assets will reprice faster than
 our interest-bearing liabilities; however, decreases in short-term interest rates will have a net negative impact on net interest income. Given our asset-sensitivity, several years ago we established floors on our variable rate loans to help
 offset the negative impact of declining interest rates on net interest income. These floors benefited net interest income in 2022 and 2021. The aggressive rate increases by the Federal Reserve in 2022 to combat inflation has had a very
 positive impact on our net interest income in 2022.

Over the past several years, our nonperforming asset levels have been low. The following table reflects period end balances of these nonperforming assets as well as total loan delinquencies.

We recorded a provision for loan losses benefit of 1.1 million in 2022. We recorded a provision for loan losses benefit of 2.1 million in 2021 and we recorded a provision for loan losses
 of 3.0 million in 2020. The level of provisions in each year was impacted by recoveries from our collection efforts and certain declines in our historical charge-off levels from prior years. The provision in 2020 was impacted by additional
 qualitative factors applied for the COVID-19 pandemic and a large commercial loan charge-off. The provision in 2022 and 2021 benefitted from reduction of these COVID-19 qualitative adjustments.

We experienced net charge-offs in 2020 due to a 4.1 million charge-off on a single commercial loan relationship to a movie theatre business that was in process of liquidation at the time
 that the COVID-19 pandemic began. Excluding that charge-off, we had net recoveries in 2020.

Economic conditions in our market areas of Grand Rapids and Holland, Michigan were good during the several years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic and have generally recovered from the
 second quarter 2020 low point caused by the pandemic and mitigation efforts. The state of Michigan s unemployment rate at the end of 2022 was 4.3 . The Grand Rapids and Holland area unemployment rate was 3.0 at the end of 2022.

In the housing markets in our primary market areas strong purchase demand exists which has caused a shortage in the inventory of existing homes for sale. In response, new living unit starts
 increased in 2021 and continued in 2022. In the Grand Rapids market during 2022, total living unit starts were up 68 compared to 2021 driven by apartment unit growth. The Holland-Grand Haven/Lakeshore region showed different results with
 living units starts down 19 in 2022 over 2021. Generally speaking, residential housing property values have increased during 2022.

Commercial banking is an important focus for us. Most of our emphasis has been on growing commercial and industrial loans. The PPP program and borrowers' reluctance to deploy funds during
 the pandemic had a significant impact on commercial lending in 2020 and 2021. We saw growth in our commercial and consumer loan portfolios in 2022, but overall balances remain below pre-pandemic levels (before 2020).

We have no material foreign loans, assets or activities. No material part of our business is dependent on a single customer or very few customers. Our loan portfolio is not concentrated in
 any one industry.

Products and Services

Loan Portfolio

We have historically offered a broad range of loan products to business customers, including commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans, and to retail customers, including
 residential mortgage and consumer loans. Select, well-managed loan renewal activity is taking place and we are seeing growth in our commercial loan portfolios and pipelines. Following is a discussion of our various types of lending
 activities.

- 2 - 

Table of Contents 

Commercial and Industrial Loans

Our commercial and industrial lending portfolio contains loans with a variety of purposes and security, including loans to finance operations and equipment. Generally, our commercial and
 industrial lending has been limited to borrowers headquartered, or doing business, in our primary market area. These credit relationships typically require the satisfaction of appropriate loan covenants and debt formulas, and generally require
 that the Bank be the primary depository bank of the business. These loan covenants and debt formulas are monitored through periodic, required reporting of accounts receivable aging schedules and financial statements, and in the case of larger
 business operations, reviews or audits by independent professional firms.

Commercial and industrial loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower's business. As a result, the availability of
 funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and economic conditions. Further, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to
 appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business.

Commercial Real Estate Loans

Our commercial real estate loans consist primarily of construction and development loans and multi-family and other non-residential real estate loans.

Construction and Development Loans. These consist of construction loans to commercial customers for the construction of their business facilities. They
 also include construction loans to builders and developers for the construction of one- to four-family residences and the development of one- to four-family lots, residential subdivisions, condominium developments and other commercial
 developments.

This portfolio can be affected by job losses, declines in real estate value, declines in home sale volumes, and declines in new home building. As such, we limit our exposure to residential
 land development and other construction and development loans.

Multi-Family and Other Non-Residential Real Estate Loans. These are permanent loans secured by multi-family and other non-residential real estate and
 include loans secured by apartment buildings, condominiums, small office buildings, small business facilities, medical facilities and other non-residential building properties, substantially all of which are located within our primary market
 area.

Multi-family and other non-residential real estate loans generally present a higher level of risk than loans secured by owner occupied one- to four-family residences. This greater risk is
 due to several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic conditions on income producing properties and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring
 these types of loans. Furthermore, the repayment of these loans is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate project. For example, if leases are not obtained or renewed, or a bankruptcy court modifies a
 lease term, or a major tenant is unable to fulfill its lease obligations, cash flow from the project will be reduced. If cash flow from the project is reduced, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired.

Retail Loans

Our retail loans are loans to consumers and consist primarily of residential mortgage loans and consumer loans.

Residential Mortgage Loans. We originate construction loans to individuals for the construction of their residences and owner-occupied residential
 mortgage loans, which are generally long-term with either fixed or adjustable interest rates. Our general policy is to sell the majority of our fixed rate residential mortgage loans in the secondary market due primarily to the interest rate
 risk associated with these loans. In 2022, with the rising rate environment, more of the production was in adjustable rate loans which we hold in portfolio, and we also began holding more of our fixed rate production in portfolio given the
 higher rates. For 2022, we retained loans representing 63 of the total dollar volume originated, compared to 22 in 2021.

Our borrowers generally qualify and are underwritten using industry standards for quality residential mortgage loans. We do not originate loans that are considered "sub-prime". Residential
 mortgage loan originations derive from a number of sources, including advertising, direct solicitation, real estate broker referrals, existing borrowers and depositors, builders and walk-in customers. Loan applications are accepted at most of
 our offices and online. The substantial majority of these loans are secured by one-to-four family properties in our market area.

Consumer Loans. We originate a variety of different types of consumer loans, including automobile loans, home equity lines of credit and installment
 loans, home improvement loans, deposit account loans and other loans for household and personal purposes. We also originate home equity lines of credit utilizing the same underwriting standards as for home equity installment loans. Home equity
 lines of credit are revolving line of credit loans. The majority of our existing home equity line of credit portfolio has variable rates with floors and ceilings, interest only payments and a maximum maturity of ten years.

Table of Contents 

The underwriting standards that we employ for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant's payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on
 the proposed loan. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security, if any, in relation to the proposed loan amount. Consumer loans may
 entail greater credit risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans which are unsecured or are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles. In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a
 defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the
 borrower's continuing financial stability, and are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount
 which can be recovered on such loans.

Securities Portfolio

Our securities portfolio is classified as either "available for sale" or "held to maturity." Securities classified as "available for sale" may be sold prior to maturity due to changes in
 interest rates, prepayment risks, and availability of alternative investments, or to meet our liquidity needs.

The primary objective of our investing activities is to provide for the safety of the principal invested. Our secondary considerations include the maximization of earnings, liquidity and to
 help decrease our overall exposure to changes in interest rates. We have generally invested in bonds with lower credit risk, primarily those secured by government agencies or insured municipalities, to assist in the diversification of credit
 risk within our asset base.

We have not experienced any credit losses within our securities portfolio in 2022.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

The following is a summary of statutes and regulations affecting Macatawa Bank Corporation and Macatawa Bank. A change in applicable laws or regulations may have a
 material effect on us and our business.

The information under Item 1 Business of this report is incorporated here by reference.

General

Financial institutions and their holding companies are extensively regulated under federal and state law. Consequently, our growth and earnings performance can be affected not only by
 management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the statutes administered by, and the regulations and policies of, various governmental regulatory authorities. Those authorities include, but are not limited to, the Board of
 Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board"), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), the FDIC, the State of Michigan s Department of Insurance and Financial Services DIFS ), the Internal Revenue Service,
 and state taxing authorities. The effect of such statutes, regulations and policies can be significant, and cannot be predicted with a high degree of certainty.

Federal and state laws and regulations generally applicable to financial institutions and their holding companies regulate, among other things, the scope of business, investments, reserves
 against deposits, capital levels relative to operations, lending activities and practices, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, mergers, consolidations and declaration and payment of dividends. The
 system of supervision and regulation applicable to us and our bank establishes a comprehensive framework for our respective operations and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC's deposit insurance fund, our depositors, and the
 public, rather than our shareholders.

Federal law and regulations establish supervisory standards applicable to our lending activities, including internal controls, credit underwriting, loan documentation and loan-to-value ratios
 for loans secured by real property.

Macatawa Bank Corporation

General . Macatawa Bank Corporation is registered as a bank holding company with, and subject to regulation by, the Federal Reserve
 Board under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA"). Under the BHCA, Macatawa Bank Corporation is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve Board, and is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board
 periodic reports of our operations and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require.

In accordance with Federal Reserve Board policy, Macatawa Bank Corporation is expected to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank. In
 addition, if the DIFS deems the Bank's capital to be impaired, the DIFS may require the Bank to restore its capital by a special assessment upon Macatawa Bank Corporation as the Bank's sole shareholder. If Macatawa Bank Corporation were to
 fail to pay any such assessment, the directors of the Bank would be required, under Michigan law, to sell all or part of the shares of the Bank's stock owned by Macatawa Bank Corporation to the highest bidder at either a public or private
 auction and use the proceeds of the sale to restore the Bank's capital.

Table of Contents 

Investments and Activities . In general, any direct or indirect acquisition by us of any voting shares of any bank which would result in
 our direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 of any class of voting shares of such bank, and any merger or consolidation between us and another bank holding company or financial holding company, will require the prior written
 approval of the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA.

The merger or consolidation of the Bank with another bank, or the acquisition by the Bank of assets of another bank, or the assumption of liability by the Bank to pay any deposits of another
 bank, will require the prior written approval of the FDIC under the Bank Merger Act and DIFS under the Michigan Banking Code. In addition, in certain such cases, an application to, and the prior approval of, the Federal Reserve Board under the
 BHCA may be required.

Capital Requirements . The Federal Reserve Board uses capital adequacy guidelines in its examination and regulation of bank holding
 companies. If capital falls below minimum guidelines, a bank holding company may, among other things, be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non-bank businesses.

Additional information on our capital ratios may be found in Item 7 of this report under the heading "Capital Resources" included in "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of
 Operations and Financial Condition" and in Item 8 of this report in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and is here incorporated by reference.

Dividends . Macatawa Bank Corporation is a corporation separate and distinct from the Bank. Most of our revenues are dividends paid by
 the Bank. Thus, Macatawa Bank Corporation's ability to pay dividends to our shareholders is indirectly limited by restrictions on the Bank's ability to pay dividends described below. Further, in a policy statement, the Federal Reserve Board
 has expressed its view that a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends if its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends,
 its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition, or it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. The
 Federal Reserve Board possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations. Among
 these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies. Similar enforcement powers over our Bank are possessed by the FDIC. The "prompt corrective action" provisions of federal law and regulation
 authorizes the FDIC to restrict the payment of dividends to Macatawa Bank Corporation by our Bank if the Bank fails to meet specified capital levels.

In addition, the Michigan Business Corporation Act provides that dividends may be legally declared or paid only if after the distribution a corporation can pay its debts as they come due in
 the usual course of business and its total assets equal or exceed the sum of its liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of any holders of preferred stock whose preferential rights
 are superior to those receiving the distribution.

Additional information about restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Bank may be found in Item 8 of this report in Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is here
 incorporated by reference.

Federal Securities Regulation. Our common stock is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
 Act"). We are subject to the reporting, proxy solicitation, insider trading and other restrictions and requirements of the SEC under the Exchange Act. We are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which imposes numerous reporting, accounting,
 corporate governance and business practices on companies, as well as financial and other professionals who have involvement with the U.S. public markets. We are generally subject to these requirements and applicable SEC rules and regulations.

Macatawa Bank

General . Macatawa Bank is a Michigan banking corporation, and its deposit accounts are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (the
 "Insurance Fund") of the FDIC. The Bank is subject to the examination, supervision, reporting and enforcement requirements of the DIFS, as the chartering authority for Michigan banks, and the FDIC, as administrator of the Insurance Fund. 
 These agencies, and the federal and state laws applicable to the Bank and its operations, extensively regulate various aspects of the banking business, including, among other things, permissible types and amounts of loans, investments and other
 activities, capital adequacy, branching, interest rates on loans and on deposits, the maintenance of noninterest bearing reserves on deposit accounts, and the safety and soundness of banking practices.

Deposit Insurance . As an FDIC-insured institution, the Bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC. The
 FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system under which all insured depository institutions are placed into one of four categories and assessed insurance premiums, based upon their respective levels of capital and results of supervisory
 evaluation. Institutions categorized as well-capitalized (as defined by the FDIC) and considered healthy pay the lowest premium, while institutions that are categorized as less than adequately capitalized (as defined by the FDIC) and
 considered of substantial supervisory concern pay the highest premium. Risk classification of all insured institutions is made by the FDIC for each semi-annual assessment period.

- 9 - 

Table of Contents 

The FDIC s deposit insurance assessment base methodology uses average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity as the assessment base. Under this calculation, most well
 capitalized banks will pay 5 to 9 basis points annually, increasing up to 35 basis points for banks that pose significant supervisory concerns. This base rate may be adjusted for the level of unsecured debt and brokered deposits, resulting in
 adjusted rates ranging from 2.5 to 9 basis points annually for most well capitalized banks to 30 to 45 basis points for banks that pose significant supervisory concerns. We estimate our annual assessment rate to be 5 basis points in 2023.

Capital Requirements . The FDIC has established the following minimum capital standards for FDIC insured banks that are not relying on
 the Community Bank Leverage Ratio, such as the Bank: a leverage requirement consisting of a ratio of Tier 1 capital to total average assets and risk-based capital requirements consisting of a ratio of total capital to total risk-weighted
 assets, a ratio of Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets, and a ratio of common equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital to risk weighted assets. Tier 1 capital consists principally of shareholders' equity. Common equity Tier 1 capital excludes
 forms of stock that are not common stock.

Basel III . The regulatory capital requirements include a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CET1 ratio) of
 4.5 and a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 of risk-weighted assets, which effectively results in a minimum CET1 ratio of 7.0 . The minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is 6.0 (which, with the capital conservation buffer,
 effectively results in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5 ), which effectively results in a minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.5 (with the capital conservation buffer). The minimum leverage ratio is 4.0 . The capital
 ratios for the Company and the Bank under Basel III continue to exceed the well capitalized minimum capital requirements.

Federal regulations define these capital categories as follows:

CET1 Risk-Based 
 Capital Ratio

Tier 1 Risk-Based 
 Capital Ratio

Total Risk-Based 
 Capital Ratio

Leverage Ratio

Well capitalized

6.5 or above

8 or above

10 or above

5 or above

Adequately capitalized

4.5 or above

6 or above

8 or above

4 or above

Undercapitalized

Less than 4.5 

Less than 6 

Less than 8 

Less than 4 

Significantly undercapitalized

Less than 3 

Less than 4 

Less than 6 

Less than 3 

Critically undercapitalized

Ratio of tangible equity to total assets of 2 or less

Federal law provides the federal banking regulators with broad power to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. Depending upon the capital
 category to which an institution is assigned, the regulators' corrective powers include: requiring the submission of a capital restoration plan; placing limits on asset growth and restrictions on activities; requiring the institution to issue
 additional capital stock (including additional voting stock) or to be acquired; restricting transactions with affiliates; restricting the interest rate the institution may pay on deposits; ordering a new election of directors of the
 institution; requiring that senior executive officers or directors be dismissed; prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries; prohibiting the payment of
 principal or interest on subordinated debt; and ultimately, appointing a receiver for the institution.

In general, a depository institution may be reclassified to a lower category than is indicated by its capital levels if the appropriate federal depository institution regulatory agency
 determines the institution to be otherwise in an unsafe or unsound condition or to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice. This could include a failure by the institution, following receipt of a less-than-satisfactory rating on its most
 recent examination report, to correct the deficiency.

As of December 31, 2022, the Bank was categorized as well capitalized under the standards set forth in the rules implementing Basel III. Additional information on our capital ratios may
 be found in Item 8 of this report in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and is here incorporated by reference.

Dividends . Under Michigan law, the Bank is restricted as to the maximum amount of dividends it may pay on its common stock. The Bank
 may not pay dividends except out of net income after deducting its losses and bad debts. A Michigan state bank may not declare or pay a dividend unless the bank will have surplus amounting to at least 20 of its capital after the payment of the
 dividend.

Federal law generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the
 depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. The FDIC may prevent an insured bank from paying dividends if the bank is in default of payment of any assessment due to the FDIC. In addition, the FDIC may prohibit the payment of
 dividends by the Bank, if such payment is determined to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice.

Table of Contents 

Additional information about restrictions on payment of dividends by the Bank may be found in Item 8 of this report in Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and is here
 incorporated by reference.

Insider Transactions . The Bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on any extensions of credit to Macatawa or any
 subsidiary of Macatawa, on investments in the stock or other securities of Macatawa or any subsidiary of Macatawa and the acceptance of the stock or other securities of Macatawa or any subsidiary of Macatawa as collateral for loans. Certain
 limitations and reporting requirements are also placed on extensions of credit by the Bank to its directors and officers, to Macatawa's directors and officers, to our principal shareholders and to "related interests" of such directors, officers
 and principal shareholders. In addition, federal law and regulations may affect the terms upon which any person becoming a director or officer of our company or any subsidiary or a principal shareholder in our company may obtain credit from
 banks with which the Bank maintains a correspondent relationship.

Safety and Soundness Standards . The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines to promote the safety and soundness of federally
 insured depository institutions. These guidelines establish standards for, among other things, internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth,
 compensation, fees and benefits, asset quality and earnings.

Investments and Other Activities . Under federal law and FDIC regulations, FDIC insured state banks are prohibited, subject to certain
 exceptions, from making or retaining equity investments of a type, or in an amount, that are not permissible for a national bank. Federal law, as implemented by FDIC regulations, also prohibits FDIC insured state banks and their subsidiaries,
 subject to certain exceptions, from engaging as principal in any activity that is not permitted for a national bank or its subsidiary, respectively, unless the bank meets, and continues to meet, its minimum regulatory capital requirements and
 the FDIC determines the activity would not pose a significant risk to the Insurance Fund. Impermissible investments and activities must be divested or discontinued within certain time frames set by the FDIC in accordance with federal law.

Consumer Protection Laws . The Bank's business includes making a variety of types of loans to individuals. In making these loans, we are
 subject to state usury and regulatory laws and to various federal laws and regulations, including the privacy of consumer financial information provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act,
 the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, which prohibit discrimination, specify disclosures to be made to
 borrowers regarding credit and settlement costs, and regulate the mortgage loan servicing activities of the Bank, including the maintenance and operation of escrow accounts and the transfer of mortgage loan servicing. In receiving deposits,
 the Bank is subject to extensive regulation under state and federal law and regulations, including the Truth in Savings Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the
 privacy of consumer financial information provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Violation of these laws could result in the imposition of significant damages and fines upon the Bank and its directors and officers.

Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC Regulation . A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been
 aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 BSA and subsequent laws and regulations require the Bank to take steps to prevent the use of the Bank or its systems from facilitating the flow of
 illegal or illicit money or terrorist funds. Those requirements include ensuring effective Board and management oversight, establishing policies and procedures, performing comprehensive risk assessments, developing effective monitoring and
 reporting capabilities, ensuring adequate training and establishing a comprehensive independent audit of BSA compliance activities.

The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 ("Patriot Act") significantly expanded the anti-money laundering ("AML") and financial transparency laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and
 due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Regulations promulgated under the Patriot Act impose various requirements on financial institutions, such as
 standards for verifying client identification at account opening and maintaining expanded records (including "Know Your Customer" and "Enhanced Due Diligence" practices) and other obligations to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and
 controls to aid the process of preventing, detecting, and reporting money laundering and terrorist financing. An institution subject to the Patriot Act must provide AML training to employees, designate an AML compliance officer and annually
 audit the AML program to assess its effectiveness. The FDIC continues to issue regulations and additional guidance with respect to the application and requirements of BSA and AML.

The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. Based on their administration by the United States
 Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), these are typically known as the "OFAC" rules. The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more
 of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on "United States persons"
 engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the
 sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to United States jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of United States persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot
 be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC.

Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate BSA, AML and OFAC programs, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and
 reputational consequences for the institution and result in material fines and sanctions.

Branching Authority. Michigan banks have the authority under Michigan law to establish branches anywhere in the State of Michigan,
 subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals. Banks may establish interstate branch networks through acquisitions of other banks. The establishment of de novo interstate branches or the acquisition of individual branches of a bank
 in another state (rather than the acquisition of an out-of-state bank in its entirety) is allowed only if specifically authorized by state law.

Michigan law permits both U.S. and non-U.S. banks to establish branch offices in Michigan. The Michigan Banking Code permits, in appropriate circumstances and with the approval of the DIFS,
 (1) acquisition of Michigan banks by FDIC-insured banks, savings banks or savings and loan associations located in other states, (2) sale by a Michigan bank of branches to an FDIC-insured bank, savings bank or savings and loan association
 located in a state in which a Michigan bank could purchase branches of the purchasing entity, (3) consolidation of Michigan banks and FDIC-insured banks, savings banks or savings and loan associations located in other states having laws
 permitting such consolidation, (4) establishment of branches in Michigan by FDIC-insured banks located in other states, the District of Columbia or U.S. territories or protectorates having laws permitting a Michigan bank to establish a branch
 in such jurisdiction, and (5) establishment by foreign banks of branches located in Michigan. A Michigan bank holding company may acquire a non-Michigan bank and a non-Michigan bank holding company may acquire a Michigan bank.

ITEM 1A: 

Risk Factors.

Risks related to our Business

Changes in interest rates may negatively affect our earnings and the value of our assets.

Our earnings and cash flows depend substantially upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans
 and investment securities, and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions,
 competition and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the policies of the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we
 receive on loans and investment securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect: (i) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits; (ii) the fair value of our financial assets and
 liabilities, including our securities portfolio; and (iii) the average duration of our interest-earning assets. This also includes the risk that interest-earning assets may be more responsive to changes in interest rates than interest-bearing
 liabilities, or vice versa (repricing risk), the risk that the individual interest rates or rates indices underlying various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities may not change in the same degree over a given time period
 (basis risk), and the risk of changing interest rate relationships across the spectrum of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability maturities (yield curve risk), including a prolonged flat or inverted yield curve environment. Any
 substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

National, state and local economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial
 condition .

The results of operations for financial institutions, including our Bank, may be materially and adversely affected by changes in prevailing national, state and local economic conditions. Our
 profitability is heavily influenced by the quality of the Company's loan portfolio and the stability of the Company's deposits. Unlike larger national or regional banks that are more geographically diversified, the Company provides banking and
 financial services to customers primarily in Ottawa, Kent and Allegan Counties of western Michigan. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for the Company's products and services, and the ability of
 the Company's customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of the Company's deposit funding sources. A significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of
 terrorism, outbreak of hostilities, an outbreak of a widespread epidemic or pandemic of disease (or widespread fear thereof) or other international or domestic occurrences, unemployment, changes in securities, financial, capital or credit
 markets or other factors, could impact national and local economic conditions and have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.

Our credit losses could increase and our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses.

The risk of nonpayment of loans is inherent in all lending activities and nonpayment of loans may have a material adverse effect on our earnings and overall financial condition, and the value
 of our common stock. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for potential losses based on a number of factors. If our assumptions are wrong, our allowance for loan
 losses may not be sufficient to cover our losses, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results, and may cause us to increase the allowance in the future. The actual amount of future provisions for loan losses cannot now be
 determined and may exceed the amounts of past provisions for loan losses. Federal and state banking regulators, as an integral part of their supervisory function, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. These regulatory agencies may
 require us to increase our provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan charge-offs based upon their judgments, which may be different from ours. Any increase in the allowance for loan losses could have a negative effect on our
 regulatory capital ratios, net income, financial condition and results of operations.

The implementation of the Current Expected Credit Loss accounting standard could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may have a
 material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Effective January 1, 2023, we will be required to adopt the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("the FASB") Account Standards Update 2016-13, Financial
 Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , commonly referred to as "CECL". CECL changes the allowance for loan losses methodology from an incurred loss impairment methodology to an
 expected loss methodology, which is more dependent on future economic forecasts, assumptions and models than previous accounting standards and could result in increases in, and add volatility to, our allowance for loan losses and future
 provisions for loan losses. These forecasts, assumptions and models are inherently uncertain and are based upon management's reasonable judgment in light of information currently available.

We are subject to liquidity risk in our operations, which could adversely affect our ability to fund various obligations.

Liquidity risk is the possibility of being unable to meet obligations as they come due, pay deposits when withdrawn, and fund loan and investment opportunities as they arise because of an
 inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including credit obligations to borrowers, mortgage
 originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of debt, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Liquidity of the Bank is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and retention, principal and interest payments on loans and
 investment securities, net cash provided from operations and access to other funding sources. Liquidity is essential to our business. We must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. An inability to raise
 funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale or pledging as collateral of loans and other assets could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. An inability to retain the current level of deposits, including the loss of one or more of
 the Bank's larger deposit relationships, could have a material adverse effect on the Bank's liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the
 financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of the business activity due to a market down turn or regulatory action that limits or eliminates
 access to alternate funding sources, including brokered deposits discussed above. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are nonspecific to the Company, such as severe disruption of the financial markets or negative
 expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole.

Our construction and development lending exposes us to significant risks.

Construction and development loans consist of loans to commercial customers for the construction of their business facilities. They also include construction loans to builders and developers
 for the construction of one- to four-family residences and the development of one- to four-family lots, residential subdivisions, condominium developments and other commercial developments. This portfolio may be particularly adversely affected
 by job losses, declines in real estate values, declines in home sale volumes, and declines in new home building. Declining real estate values may result in sharp increases in losses, particularly in the land development and construction loan
 portfolios to residential developers. This type of lending is generally considered to have more complex credit risks than traditional single-family residential lending because the principal is concentrated in a limited number of loans with
 repayment dependent on the successful completion and sales of the related real estate project. Consequently, these loans are often more sensitive to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the general economy than other real estate
 loans. These loans are generally less predictable and more difficult to evaluate and monitor and collateral may be difficult to dispose of in a market decline. Additionally, we may experience significant construction loan losses if independent
 appraisers or project engineers inaccurately estimate the cost and value of construction loan projects.

We have significant exposure to risks associated with commercial and residential real estate.

A substantial portion of our loan portfolio consists of commercial and residential real estate-related loans, including real estate development, construction and residential and commercial
 mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 537.6 million of commercial real estate loans outstanding, which represented approximately 45.7 of our total loan portfolio. As of that same date, we had approximately 139.1
 million in residential real estate loans outstanding, or approximately 11.8 of our total loan portfolio. Consequently, real estate-related credit risks are a significant concern for us. The adverse consequences from real estate-related credit
 risks tend to be cyclical and are often driven by national economic developments that are not controllable or entirely foreseeable by us or our borrowers.

Table of Contents 

Commercial loans may expose us to greater financial and credit risk than other loans.

Our commercial loan portfolio, including commercial mortgages, was approximately 979.3 million at December 31, 2022, comprising approximately 83.2 of our total loan portfolio. Commercial
 loans generally carry larger loan balances and can involve a greater degree of financial and credit risk than other loans. Any significant failure to pay on time by our customers would hurt our earnings. The increased financial and credit risk
 associated with these types of loans are a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the size of loan balances, the effects of general economic conditions on income-producing
 properties and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. In addition, when underwriting a commercial or industrial loan, we may take a security interest in commercial real estate, and, in some instances upon a
 default by the borrower, we may foreclose on and take title to the property, which may lead to potential financial risks for us under applicable environmental laws. If hazardous substances were discovered on any of these properties, we may be
 liable to governmental agencies or third parties for the costs of remediation of the hazard, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Many environmental laws can impose liability regardless of whether we knew of, or were responsible
 for, the contamination.

Our loan portfolio has and will continue to be affected by the housing market.

Loans to residential developers involved in the development or sale of 1-4 family residential properties were approximately 21.4 million, 16.1 million and 21.4 million at December 31,
 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As we continue our on-going portfolio monitoring, we will make credit and reserve decisions based on the current conditions of the borrower or project combined with our expectations for the future. If the
 housing market deteriorates, we could experience higher charge-offs and delinquencies in this portfolio.

We are subject to significant government regulation, and any regulatory changes may adversely affect us.

The banking industry is heavily regulated under both federal and state law. These regulations are primarily intended to protect customers and the Deposit Insurance Fund, not our creditors or
 shareholders. We are subject to extensive regulation by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the DIFS, in addition to other regulatory and self-regulatory organizations. Future regulatory changes or accounting pronouncements may increase our
 regulatory capital requirements or adversely affect our regulatory capital levels. Regulations affecting banks and financial services companies undergo continuous change, and we cannot predict the ultimate effect of such changes, which could
 have a material adverse effect on our profitability or financial condition.

The Company could be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions, including defaults by larger financial institutions.

The Company's ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services
 institutions are interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships between financial institutions. The Company has exposure to multiple counterparties, and the Company routinely executes transactions
 with counterparties in the financial industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems
 and losses or defaults by the Company or by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as "systemic risk" and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and
 exchanges, with which the Company interacts on a daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect the Company.

We rely heavily on our management and other key personnel, and the loss of any of them may adversely affect our operations.

We are and will continue to be dependent upon the services of our management team and other key personnel. Losing the services of one or more key members of our management team could
 adversely affect our operations.

Our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.

Management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well
 designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. If we fail to identify and remediate control deficiencies, it is possible that
 a material misstatement of interim or annual financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In addition, any failure or circumvention of our other controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related
 to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The Bank may be required to pay additional insurance premiums to the FDIC, which could negatively impact earnings.

Depending upon any future losses that the FDIC insurance fund may suffer, there can be no assurance that there will not be additional premium increases in order to replenish the fund. The
 FDIC may need to set a higher base rate schedule or impose special assessments due to future financial institution failures and updated failure and loss projections. Increased FDIC assessment rates could have an adverse impact on our results of
 operations.

If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through organic growth and acquisitions could be
 materially impaired.

We are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain specified levels of capital to support our operations. We may need to raise additional capital to support our current
 level of assets or our growth. Our ability to raise additional capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. We cannot assure that we will be able to
 raise additional capital in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to expand our operations through organic growth or acquisitions could be materially limited. Additional
 information on the capital requirements applicable to the Bank may be found under the heading "Regulatory Capital" in Note 19 in Item 8.

We may be a defendant in a variety of litigation and other actions, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
 operations.

We may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation arising out of our business. Our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us, and any claims asserted
 against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation or cause us to incur unexpected expenses, which could be material in amount. Should the ultimate expenses, judgments or settlements in any litigation exceed our
 insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, and we may not be able to
 obtain adequate replacement of our existing policies with acceptable terms, if at all.

Our future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry.

We face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of different competitors. Our future growth and success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in
 this highly competitive environment. We compete for deposits, loans and other financial services with numerous Michigan-based and out-of-state banks, thrifts, credit unions and other financial institutions as well as other entities which
 provide financial services, including technology-oriented financial services (FinTech) companies. Some of the financial institutions and financial services organizations with which we compete are not subject to the same degree of regulation as
 we are. Most of our competitors have been in business for many years, have established customer bases, are larger, and have substantially higher lending limits than we do. The financial services industry is also likely to become more
 competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. Competition for limited, high-quality lending opportunities and core deposits in an increasingly competitive marketplace may adversely affect
 our results of operations.

Evaluation of investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment involves subjective
 determinations and could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition. 

The evaluation of impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of
 investments should be recognized in current period earnings. The risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer's financial condition or future recovery prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or
 credit spreads and the expected recovery period. Estimating future cash flows involves incorporating information received from third-party sources and making internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying
 collateral and assessing the probability that an adverse change in future cash flows has occurred. The determination of the amount of other-than-temporary impairments is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent
 risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Our management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses
 reasonable judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for recovery. Inherent in management's evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the
 operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Impairments to the carrying value of our investment securities may need to be taken in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
 condition.

We depend upon the accuracy and completeness of information about customers.

In deciding whether to extend credit to customers, we rely on information provided to us by our customers, including financial statements and other financial information. We also rely on
 representations of customers as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. Our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted
 to the extent that we extend credit in reliance on financial statements or other information provided by customers that is false, misleading or incomplete.

Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information, whether through a breach of computer systems or otherwise, or
 failure or interruption of the Company's communication or information systems, could severely harm the Company s business.

As part of its business, the Company collects, processes and retains sensitive and confidential client and customer information on behalf of the Company and other third parties. Despite the
 security measures the Company has in place for its facilities and systems, and the security measures of its third party service providers, the Company may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or
 lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events.

The Company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. Any failure or interruption of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the
 Company s customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. In addition, customers could lose access to their accounts and be unable to conduct financial transactions during a period of failure or interruption
 of these systems.

Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information, whether such information is held by the Company or by its
 vendors, or failure or interruption of the Company's communication or information systems, could severely damage the Company s reputation, expose it to risks of regulatory scrutiny, litigation and liability, disrupt the Company s operations, or
 result in a loss of customer business, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business.

Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our
 reputation and results of operations.

Cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures
 known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company and/or its third party service providers. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been
 material to the Company. Although we employ comprehensive measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats (including access controls, employee training, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT
 networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems), cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data
 and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties
 and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could materially adversely affect our results of operations.

We continually encounter technological change, and we may have fewer resources than our competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements.

The banking industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the
 effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and
 services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. There can be no
 assurance that we will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to our customers.

An "ownership change" for purposes of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code could materially impair our ability to use our deferred tax assets.

At December 31, 2022, our gross deferred tax asset was 11.9 million. Our ability to use our deferred tax assets to offset future taxable income will be limited if we experience an "ownership
 change" as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in our ownership by "5-percent shareholders" (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points
 over a rolling three-year period. A corporation that experiences an ownership change will generally be subject to an annual limitation on the use of its pre-ownership change deferred tax assets equal to the equity value of the corporation
 immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate.

If an "ownership change" occurs, we could lose certain built-in losses that have not been recognized for tax purposes. The amount of the permanent loss would depend on the size of the annual
 limitation (which is in part a function of our market capitalization at the time of an "ownership change") and the remaining carry forward period (U.S. federal net operating losses generally may be carried forward for a period of 20 years).

Our ability to maintain, attract and retain customer relationships is highly dependent on our reputation.

Our customers rely on us to deliver superior, personalized financial services with the highest standards of ethics, performance, professionalism and compliance. Damage to our reputation could
 undermine the confidence of our current customers and our ability to attract potential customers. Such damage could also impair the confidence of our contractual counterparties and vendors and ultimately affect our ability to effect
 transactions. Maintenance of our reputation depends not only on our success in maintaining our service-focused culture and controlling and mitigating the various risks described herein, but also on our success in identifying and appropriately
 addressing issues that may arise in areas such as potential conflicts of interest, anti-money laundering, client personal information and privacy issues, employee, customer and other third party fraud, record-keeping, regulatory investigations
 and any litigation that may arise from the failure or perceived failure of us to comply with legal and regulatory requirements.

Employee misconduct could expose us to significant legal liability and reputational harm.

We are vulnerable to reputational harm because we operate in an industry in which integrity and the confidence of our customers are of critical importance. Our employees could engage in
 misconduct that adversely affects our customers, other employees, and/or our business. For example, if an employee were to engage in fraudulent, illegal, wrongful or suspicious activities, and/or activities resulting in consumer harm, we could
 be subject to litigation, regulatory sanctions or penalties, and suffer serious harm to our reputation (as a consequence of the negative perception resulting from such activities), financial position, customer relationships and ability to
 attract new customers. Our business often requires that we deal with confidential information. If our employees were to improperly use or disclose this information, even if inadvertently, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation,
 financial position and current and future business relationships. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not always be effective. Misconduct or harassment by
 our employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct or harassment, or improper use or disclosure of confidential information by our employees, even inadvertently, could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial
 condition or results of operations.

Our operations could be interrupted if certain external vendors on which we rely experience difficulty, terminate their services or fail to comply with
 banking laws and regulations.

We depend to a significant extent on relationships with third party service providers. Specifically, we utilize third party core banking services and receive credit card and debit card
 services, branch capture services, Internet banking services and services complementary to our banking products from various third party service providers. If these third party service providers experience difficulties or terminate their
 services and we are unable to replace them with other service providers, our operations could be interrupted. It may be difficult for us to replace some of our third party vendors, particularly vendors providing our core banking, credit card
 and debit card services, in a timely manner if they were unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in the future for any reason. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, it could have a material adverse
 effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Even if we are able to replace them, it may be at higher cost to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Uncertainty relating to the LIBOR calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR may adversely affect our results of operations.

On July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit
 rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. In November 2020, the Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would continue to publish LIBOR rates through June 30, 2023. It is unclear whether, or in what
 form, LIBOR will continue to exist after that date. At this time, it appears that market consensus is building around using the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") as an acceptable alternative reference rate to LIBOR, though that remains
 to be determined. SOFR may fail to gain market acceptance. SOFR was developed for use in certain U.S. dollar derivatives and other financial contracts as an alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR in part because it is considered to be a good
 representation of general funding conditions in the overnight U.S. Treasury repo market. However, as a rate based on transactions secured by U.S. Treasury securities, it does not measure bank-specific credit risk and, as a result, is less
 likely to correlate with the unsecured short-term funding costs of banks. This may mean that market participants would not consider SOFR to be a suitable substitute or successor for all of the purposes for which U.S. dollar LIBOR historically
 has been used, which may, in turn, lessen its market acceptance.

It is impossible to predict the effect of SOFR or any other alternative reference rate on the value of LIBOR-based securities and variable rate loans, subordinated debentures, or other
 securities or financial arrangements, given LIBOR's role in determining market interest rates globally. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect
 LIBOR rates and the value of LIBOR-based loans and securities in our portfolio, and may impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and borrowings. If LIBOR rates are no longer available, and we are required to implement
 alternative reference rates, such as SOFR, for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our borrowers, we may incur significant expenses in effecting the transition, and may be subject to disputes or litigation with
 customers over the appropriateness or comparability of LIBOR to SOFR or another alternative reference rate, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Risks Associated With the Company's Stock

The market price of our common stock can be volatile, which may make it more difficult to resell our common stock at a desired time and price.

Stock price volatility may make it more difficult for a shareholder to resell our common stock when a shareholder wants to and at prices a shareholder finds attractive or at all. Our stock
 price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, regardless of operating results. These factors include, among other things:

Variations in our anticipated or actual operating results or the results of our competitors;

Changes in investors' or analysts' perceptions of the risks and conditions of our business;

The size of the public float of our common stock;

Regulatory developments, including changes to regulatory capital levels, components of regulatory capital and how regulatory capital is calculated;

Interest rate changes or credit loss trends;

Trading volume in our common stock;

Market conditions; and

General economic conditions.

The Company may issue additional shares of its common stock in the future, which could dilute a shareholder's ownership of common stock.

The Company's articles of incorporation authorize its Board of Directors, without shareholder approval, to, among other things, issue additional shares of common or preferred stock. The
 issuance of any additional shares of common or preferred stock could be dilutive to a shareholder's ownership of Company common stock.

To the extent that the Company issues options or warrants to purchase common stock in the future and the options or warrants are exercised, the Company's shareholders may experience further
 dilution. Holders of shares of Company common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, shareholders may not be permitted to invest in
 future issuances of Company common or preferred stock.

 Nasdaq Global Select Market. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This
 marketplace depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. This limited market may affect a shareholder s ability to sell their shares on short notice, and the sale of
 a large number of shares at one time could temporarily depress the market price of our common stock. For these reasons, our common stock should not be viewed as a short-term investment.

The Company's common stock is not insured by any governmental entity.

Our common stock is not a deposit account or other obligation of any bank and is not insured by the FDIC or any other governmental entity. Investment in Company common stock is subject to
 risk, including possible loss.

The Company may issue debt and equity securities that are senior to Company common stock as to distributions and in liquidation, which could negatively
 affect the value of Company common stock.

The Company has in the past and may in the future increase its capital by entering into debt or debt-like financing or issuing debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of
 senior notes, subordinated notes, preferred stock or common stock. In the event of the Company's liquidation, its lenders and holders of its debt securities would receive a distribution of the Company's available assets before distributions to
 the holders of Company common stock. The Company's decision to incur debt and issue securities in future offerings will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond its control. The Company cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing
 or nature of its future offerings and debt financings. Future offerings could reduce the value of shares of Company common stock and dilute a shareholder's interest in the Company.

Our articles of incorporation and bylaws and Michigan laws contain certain provisions that could make a takeover more difficult.

Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, and the laws of Michigan, include provisions which are designed to provide our Board of Directors with time to consider whether a hostile takeover
 offer is in our best interest and the best interests of our shareholders. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control. The provisions also could diminish the opportunities for
 a holder of our common stock to participate in tender offers, including tender offers at a price above the then-current price for our common stock. These provisions could also prevent transactions in which our shareholders might otherwise
 receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices, and may limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.

The Michigan Business Corporation Act contains provisions intended to protect shareholders and prohibit or discourage certain types of hostile takeover activities. In addition to these
 provisions and the provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, federal law requires the Federal Reserve Board's approval prior to acquisition of "control" of a bank holding company. All of these provisions may have the effect of
 delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company without action by our shareholders, and therefore, could adversely affect the price of our common stock.

If an entity holds as little as a 5 interest in our outstanding securities, that entity could, under certain circumstances, be subject to regulation as
 a "bank holding company."

Any entity, including a "group" composed of natural persons, owning or controlling with the power to vote 25 or more of our outstanding securities, or 5 or more if the holder otherwise
 exercises a "controlling influence" over us, may be subject to regulation as a "bank holding company" in accordance with the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHC Act"). In addition, any bank holding company or foreign bank
 with a U.S. presence may be required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board under the BHC Act to acquire or retain 5 or more of our outstanding securities. Becoming a bank holding company imposes statutory and regulatory
 restrictions and obligations, such as providing managerial and financial strength for its bank subsidiaries. Regulation as a bank holding company could require the holder to divest all or a portion of the holder's investment in our securities
 or those nonbanking investments that may be deemed impermissible or incompatible with bank holding company status, such as a material investment in a company unrelated to banking.

Management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the discussion of forward-looking statements at the
 beginning of this report.

The following section presents additional information to assess our results of operations and financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
 statements and the supplemental financial data contained elsewhere in this report.

The information under Item 1 Business of this report is incorporated here by reference.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Summary: Net income was 34.7 million 43.1 million on a pretax basis) for 2022, compared to 29.0 million 35.7 million on a pretax basis) for 2021. 
 Earnings per common share on a diluted basis were 1.01 for 2022 and 0.85 for 2021.

During 2022, the improvement in our earnings was the result of growth in revenue while expenses were relatively stable. Throughout 2022, the Federal Reserve Bank increased the federal funds
 rate several times, bringing the high end of their rate range rate from 0.25 at the beginning of the year to 4.50 by the end of 2022. Given our asset sensitive balance sheet posture, this had a very positive impact on our earnings in 2022. 
 Net interest income increased to 70.1 million in 2022 compared to 56.1 million in 2021. Gains on sales of mortgage loans were 706,000 in 2022 compared to 4.7 million in 2021 with the decrease reflecting the impact of higher interest rates
 in 2022. Other categories of noninterest income were up 309,000 in 2022, partially offsetting the impact of lower gains on mortgage sales. Total noninterest expense was 48.2 million in 2022 compared to 46.1 million in 2021.

We recorded a provision for loan losses benefit of 1.1 million in 2022 and a provision for loan losses benefit of 2.1 million in 2021. The provisions in 2022 and 2021 were favorably
 impacted by low levels of nonperforming loans, strong asset quality and the levels of net loan charge-offs to recoveries realized in recent periods and reversals of the additional qualitative factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These
 items are discussed more fully below.

Net Interest Income: Net interest income totaled 70.1 million during 2022 compared to 56.1 million during 2021.

The increase in net interest income during 2022 compared to 2021 was due primarily to an increase in yields on earning assets, particularly overnight deposits and variable rate loans as the
 federal funds rate was increased by 425 basis points in 2022 in response to high inflation resulting from recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and government stimulus. Average yields on securities, interest earning assets and net interest
 margin are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis. Our net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets (i.e. "net interest margin" or "margin") was 2.56 for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2.09 for the year
 ended December 31, 2021.

The yield on earning assets increased 54 basis points from 2.19 for 2021 to 2.73 for 2022. The increase from 2021 to 2022 was generally due to an increase of average short-term interest
 rates earned on overnight deposits and variable rate loans during 2022. The average rate on overnight deposits increased from 0.13 in 2021 to 1.53 in 2022. Our margin in recent years had been negatively impacted by our decision to hold
 significant balances in liquid and short-term investments. In 2022, our margin benefitted significantly from this strategy. Net interest income also benefitted in 2022 from significant growth in our investment portfolio. Our average
 investment portfolio balance in 2022 was 749.8 million compared to 363.0 million in 2021. Total average interest earning assets totaled 2.74 billion for 2022 compared to 2.70 billion in 2021.

Net interest income for 2022 increased 14.1 million compared to the same period in 2021. Of this increase, 12.1 million was from changes in the rates earned or paid, and 2.0 million was
 from changes in volume of average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The largest changes occurred in interest income on federal funds (our overnight deposits), interest income on commercial loans and interest income in
 our investment portfolio as we deployed more of our excess investable funds primarily into taxable securities. Interest income from federal funds sold and other short-term investments increased by 12.0 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The
 425 basis point increase in the federal funds rate from March 2022 through December 2022 caused a 12.3 million increase in interest income, partially offset by a decrease in average balances of federal funds sold and other short-term
 investments in 2022, which subtracted 324,000. The net change in interest income for commercial loans was a decrease of 3.7 million in 2022 as compared to 2021 with a 1.8 million increase due to rate offset by a 5.5 million reduction due
 to a decrease in average balances. PPP loans significantly impacted yields and interest income on commercial loans in 2021. Interest and fees on PPP loans included in interest income were 8.6 million higher in 2021 versus 2022. Offsetting
 this unfavorable swing in interest income in 2022 was the favorable impact of rising rates on our variable rate commercial loan portfolio. Interest income on this portfolio grew by 5.7 million while the yield increased from 2.95 to 4.19 
 from 2021 to 2022 in response to rising short-term rates in 2022. The net change in interest income for taxable securities was an increase of 8.1 million with 7.2 million due to an increase in average balances and 844,000 due to rate.

Yield on commercial loans increased from 4.06 in 2021 to 4.23 in 2022. Yield on residential mortgage loans decreased from 3.41 in 2021 to 3.36 in 2022, while yield on consumer loans
 increased from 4.05 in 2021 to 4.88 in 2022. The increases in yields on commercial loans and consumer loans were the result of the predominance of loans in these categories with variable rates of interest tied to prime and LIBOR or SOFR,
 which increased throughout 2022.

Our net interest margin for 2022 was negatively impacted from a 13 basis point increase in our cost of funds from 0.15 for 2021 to 0.28 for 2022. Average interest bearing liabilities
 increased from 1.69 billion in 2021 to 1.72 billion in 2022. Increases in the rates paid on certain deposit account types in response to the sharp market rate increases were the primary cause of the increase in our cost of funds. While our
 funding costs have increased, the yields on our interest earning assets increased to a much larger extent, causing net interest income and net interest margin to increase significantly from 2021 to 2022.

In 2023, we expect that net interest margin will continue to benefit from increases in the overnight funds rate and by our higher levels of short-term investment balances. The
 asset-sensitive profile of our balance sheet and our core deposit funding positions us well for favorable net interest margin results when market interest rates rise and remain elevated.

The following table shows an analysis of net interest margin for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands).

Provision for Loan Losses: The provision for loan losses for 2022 was a benefit of 1.1 million compared to a benefit of 2.1 million for 2021. The
 provision for loan losses for 2022 and 2021 were impacted by our continued strong asset quality metrics. In 2022 and 2021, economic conditions improved allowing for reductions in the additional qualitative adjustments made in 2020 related to
 the COVID-19 pandemic. This contributed to the level of benefit recorded in 2022 and 2021. In addition, specific reserves on impaired loans decreased by 270,000 in 2022 and by 646,000 in 2021. Net loan recoveries were 521,000 in 2022
 compared to 531,000 in 2021.

Our overall weighted average commercial loan grade has been below 4.00 for the past several years. Our weighted average commercial loan grade was 3.53 at December 31, 2022 and 3.60 at
 December 31, 2021.

The amounts of loan loss provision in each period were the result of establishing our allowance for loan losses at levels believed necessary based upon our methodology for determining the
 adequacy of the allowance. The sustained level of net recoveries over the past several years has had a significant effect on the historical loss component of our methodology. More information about our allowance for loan losses and our
 methodology for establishing its level may be found in this Item 7 of this report under the heading Allowance for Loan Losses below and in Item 8 of this report in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Noninterest Income: Noninterest income totaled 20.0 million in 2022 compared to 23.7 million in 2021. The components of noninterest income are shown in

Net gains on sales of mortgage loans decreased 4.0 million from 2021 to 2022 due to much lower volumes of mortgage loans originated for sale in 2022. Net gains on mortgage loans represent
 gains on the sale of real estate mortgage loans in the secondary market. We sell the majority of the fixed-rate mortgage loans we originate. We do not retain the servicing rights for the loans we sell.

As demonstrated in the table above, volume of mortgage loans originated for sale was down significantly in 2022 compared to 2021. The rapid increase in interest rates during 2022
 significantly impacted mortgage sale production volume. As long-term market interest rates impacting mortgage rates began to rise in the latter half of 2021, mortgage production slowed and resulting gains declined. As rates increased further
 in 2022, refinancing activity all but stopped and more customers chose variable rate products, which we hold in portfolio. We expect our residential mortgage loan activity to remain below normal levels as we enter 2023 given the existing rate
 environment.

Deposit service charges were up 323,000, primarily driven by growth in treasury management fee income charged to our commercial customers and growth in overdraft fee income. The improvement
 in treasury management fee income was a result of success in growing the number of business and municipal customers using these services in the last two years. These fees in 2022 were offset in part by a higher level of earnings credits due to
 higher deposit rates in 2022. Overdraft fees are driven by customer spending behavior and this activity dropped in 2020 and 2021 with the overall effect of government shutdowns on the economy, particularly in the second quarter of 2020, which
 was most impacted by the COVID-19 response. The stimulus checks sent by the federal government also helped our customers keep their accounts from overdrawing. As the economy began to normalize and customers used the economic impact payments,
 customer spending behavior began to return to normal in 2022.

Trust service revenue decreased 188,000 in 2022. This decrease was due primarily to market valuations of assets on which fees are assessed.

ATM and debit card processing income increased 263,000 in 2022 to 6.8 million compared to 6.5 million in 2021. This increase reflected an increase in ATM fees due to fees charged to
 non-Macatawa customers. This new fee was implemented in 2022. Overall ATM and debit card income has rebounded and remains at pre-pandemic levels reflecting customer preference for this payment alternative. There was overall growth in the
 number of debit and ATM card customers and promotional efforts to increase volume in these low cost transaction alternatives continue to be successful.

We did not sell any securities in 2022 or 2021. We continually review our securities portfolio and will dispose of securities that pose higher than desired credit or market risk, or as
 warranted from overall portfolio maintenance or asset-liability management.

Investment services fees increased 186,000 in 2022 due largely to an increase in the sale of annuities in the latter part of 2022.

Earnings from bank owned life insurance decreased by 155,000 in 2022 compared to 2021 due to the general performance of the underlying investments.

Other income was down by 120,000 in 2022 due largely to a reduction of title insurance fees of 123,000 as mortgage volume was down due to the higher interest rate environment.

Noninterest Expense: Noninterest expense was 48.2 million in 2022 and 46.1 million in 2021. The small increase in total noninterest expense reflected our

Salaries and benefits expense was the largest component of noninterest expense and was 26.2 million in 2022 and 25.2 million in 2021. The increase in 2022 was primarily driven by higher
 base compensation, higher variable compensation tied to brokerage activity, higher medical insurance costs from increased claims and higher 401(k) contributions more than offsetting the decrease in variable compensation tied to lower mortgage
 loan production in 2022. Our 401(k) matching costs were lower in 2021 as we reduced our matching percentage for 2021 to 100 of the first 2 of salary contributions. This was increased back to normal level beginning January 1, 2022 at 100 of
 the first 3 and 50 of the next 2 of salary contributions. The table below identifies the primary components of salaries and benefits (in thousands):

Costs associated with nonperforming assets remained at low levels, totaling 20,000 in 2022 and 45,000 in 2021. During 2022, we did not add any other real estate properties. We sold one
 other real estate property that had a valuation allowance of 100 , so the balance remained unchanged at 2.3 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021. In 2021, we did not add any other real estate properties and sold 170,000 of other real
 estate. On January 30, 2023, we sold the remaining other real estate owned property at a small gain, bringing the balance of other real estate owned to 0.

FDIC assessment expense increased to 789,000 in 2022 compared to 749,000 in 2021 primarily due to our overall asset balance sheet composition. Further discussion regarding the
 determination of FDIC assessments for the Bank may be found in Item 1 of this report under the heading "Supervision and Regulation." This expense will increase in 2023 as the FDIC has raised the premium we pay by 67 until their bank insurance
 fund reaches the level imposed by regulations.

Occupancy expense increased by 214,000 in 2022 primarily due to an increase in snow removal and building maintenance costs, partially offset by
 depreciation of our buildings. Furniture and equipment expense increased by 68,000 in 2022 primarily due to an increase in equipment and software service contracts and software, partially offset by a decrease in software amortization costs.

Data processing expenses were 3.8 million in 2022 and 3.5 million in 2021. Increases in data processing for our systems and card programs in 2022 were the primary reasons for the increase
 in 2022.

Outside services increased by 217,000 in 2022 primarily due to higher recruiting costs and outsourced internal audits.

Federal Income Tax Expense: We recorded federal income tax expense of 8.3 million in 2022 and 6.7 million in 2021. Our effective tax rate was 19.35 
 for 2022 and 18.78 for 2021. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2022 over 2021 was due to higher levels of taxable income from both growth in taxable securities held in our investment portfolio and growth in taxable income from rising
 interest rates while our tax-exempt income has remained relatively flat.

FINANCIAL CONDITION 

Summary: Total assets were 2.91 billion at December 31, 2022, decrease of 21.8 million from 2.93 billion at December 31, 2021. This change reflected
 increases of 68.8 million in our loan portfolio, 83.2 million in securities available for sale, 211.8 million in securities held to maturity, 3.5 million in accrued interest receivable, 877,000 in bank owned life insurance, 7.5 million in
 net deferred tax assets and 2.5 million in other assets, offset by decreases of 396.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, 1.5 million in premises and equipment, and 1.2 million in loans held for sale. Total deposits increased by 37.2
 million and other borrowed funds and long-term debt were down by 55.0 million at December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021.

Total shareholders equity decreased by 7.0 million from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022. Shareholders equity was increased by 34.7 million of net income in 2022, partially offset
 by cash dividends of 10.9 million, or 0.32 per share. Shareholders equity also decreased by 31.3 million in 2022 as a result of an unfavorable swing in accumulated other comprehensive income due to the effect of rising interest rates on
 the fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank was categorized as well capitalized under applicable regulatory guidelines.

Cash and Cash Equivalents: Our cash and cash equivalents, which include federal funds sold and short-term investments, were 755.2 million at December 31,
 2022 compared to 1.15 billion at December 31, 2021. This 396.6 million decrease was primarily the result of growth in our loan and investment portfolios during 2022.

Securities: Securities available for sale ("AFS") were 499.3 million at December 31, 2022 compared to 416.1 million at December 31, 2021. The balance at
 December 31, 2022 primarily consisted of U.S. Treasury and agency securities, agency mortgage backed securities and various municipal investments. The growth in securities AFS was the result of increased purchase activity to accelerate the
 strategic deployment of excess liquid funds caused by our robust deposit growth. Investment purchases were focused on short-term high quality securities consistent with our existing portfolio. Our held to maturity ("HTM") portfolio increased
 from 137.0 million at December 31, 2021 to 348.8 million at December 31, 2022. Our HTM portfolio is comprised of U.S. Treasury securities and state municipal and privately placed commercial bonds. The commercial bond component of this
 category declined by 5.5 million in 2022. These bonds represent financing provided to some of our non-profit commercial customers who qualified for borrowing on a tax-exempt basis. The municipal bond component of this category decreased by
 34.1 million. The U.S. Treasury securities component of this category increased by 251.3 million as we seized opportunities to deploy excess liquid funds in high quality bonds with short durations.

On January 1, 2022, we reclassified ten U.S. Treasury securities with an amortized cost of 123.5 million from available for sale to held to maturity, as we have the intent and ability to
 hold these securities to maturity. All ten of these U.S. Treasury securities were purchased within the fourth quarter of 2021. Subsequently and upon further analysis of these purchases, management decided to reclassify them to held to maturity
 given their short-term nature. These securities had net unrealized gains of 113,000 at the date of transfer, which will continue to be reported in accumulated comprehensive income, and will be amortized over the remaining life of the
 securities as an adjustment of yield. The effect on interest income of the amortization of net unrealized gains is offset by the amortization of the premium on the securities transferred. Total securities increased 295.0 million from 553.1
 million at December 31, 2021 to 848.0 million at December 31, 2022 as we continued to deploy excess liquidity into higher yielding assets.

Portfolio Loans and Asset Quality: Total portfolio loans increased by 68.8 million to 1.18 billion at December 31, 2022 compared to 1.11 billion at
 December 31, 2021. During 2022, our commercial portfolio increased by 43.0 million, while our residential mortgage portfolio increased by 21.3 million and our consumer portfolio increased by 4.5 million. By December 31, 2022, all of our PPP
 loans had received forgiveness from the SBA, while we had 41.9 million in remaining PPP loans at December 31, 2021.

We experienced year over year growth in commercial loans in 2022 after experiencing a decline in commercial loan balances in 2021. Commercial loans grew 119.6 million in 2020, decreased
 281.2 million in 2021 and increased 43.0 million in 2022. Most of the growth in 2020 and decline in 2021 was attributable to PPP loan activity. We returned to commercial loan growth in 2022 and plan for measured, high quality loan portfolio
 growth in 2023. Excluding PPP loans, total commercial loans grew by 84.9 million in 2022.

Commercial and commercial real estate loans remained our largest loan segment and accounted for 83.2 of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 and 84.4 at December 31, 2021.
 Residential mortgage and consumer loans comprised 16.8 of total loans at December 31, 2022 and 15.6 at December 31, 2021.

Includes both owner occupied and non-owner occupied commercial real estate.

Commercial real estate loans increased 21.5 million since December 31, 2021 and accounted for 45.7 of our total loan portfolio at year-end 2022 and consisted primarily of loans to business
 owners and developers of owner and non-owner occupied commercial properties and loans to developers of single and multi-family residential properties. In the table above, we show our commercial real estate portfolio by loans secured by
 residential and commercial real estate, and by stage of development. Improved loans are generally secured by properties that are under construction or completed and placed in use. Development loans are secured by properties that are in the
 process of development or fully developed. Vacant and unimproved loans are secured by raw land for which development has not yet begun and agricultural land.

Our overall commercial and industrial loan portfolio, including PPP, increased by 21.5 million to 441.7 million at December 31, 2022 and represented 37.5 of our total loan portfolio. This
 change includes 41.9 million net reduction in outstanding balances on PPP loans, due to SBA forgiveness.

Our consumer residential mortgage loan portfolio, which also includes residential construction loans made to individual homeowners, comprised approximately 11.8 of portfolio loans at
 December 31, 2022 and 10.7 at December 31, 2021. We expect to continue to retain in our loan portfolio certain types of residential mortgage loans (primarily high quality, low loan to value, adjustable rate loans) in an effort to continue to
 diversify our credit risk and deploy our excess liquidity. Typically, a large portion of our residential mortgage loan production is sold on the secondary market with servicing released. However, given the significant increase in residential
 mortgage loan rates, we have increased the amount of such loans retained in portfolio as they will typically have lower duration due to refinancings that occur when interest rates decline.

The volume of residential mortgage loans originated for sale during 2022 decreased from 2021 as interest rates increased in 2022 and demand for refinancings declined as many potential
 borrowers had recently refinanced in the extended low interest rate environment. In addition, customer preference drove more production in loan product types we retain in portfolio (i.e. variable rate, short term mortgages). We expect
 residential mortgage originations for sale to continue to be below normal levels as we enter 2023 given the existing rate environment. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were 26.2 million in 2022 compared to 124.3 million in
 2021. The Company had no repurchase demands or claims related to residential mortgage loans sold on the secondary market during the five-year period ended December 31, 2022.

Our portfolio of other consumer loans includes loans secured by personal property and home equity fixed term and line of credit loans. Consumer loans increased by 4.5 million to 59.3
 million at December 31, 2022 from 54.8 million at December 31, 2021 primarily due to an increase in home equity loans. Consumer loans comprised approximately 5.0 of our portfolio loans at December 31, 2022 and 4.9 at December 31, 2021.

Excluding PPP originations, our loan origination activity was up 55.0 million in 2022 compared to 2021. We believe the increased origination activity is primarily the result of increased
 business activity occurring in our marketplace as uncertainty over economic conditions with the COVID-19 pandemic has decreased.

Our loan portfolio is reviewed regularly by our senior management, our loan officers, and an internal loan review team that is independent of our loan originators and credit administration.
 An administrative loan committee consisting of senior management and seasoned lending and collections personnel meets monthly to manage our internal watch list and proactively manage high risk loans.

When reasonable doubt exists concerning collectability of interest or principal of one of our loans, the loan is placed in nonaccrual status. Any interest previously accrued but not collected
 is reversed and charged against current earnings.

Nonperforming assets are comprised of nonperforming loans, foreclosed assets and repossessed assets. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, nonperforming assets totaled 2.4 million. There were no
 additions to other real estate owned in 2022 or in 2021. Based on the loans currently in their redemption period, we expect there to be few, if any, additions to other real estate owned in 2022. There were no sales of foreclosed and
 repossessed properties in 2022. Proceeds from sales of foreclosed properties were 170,000 in 2021 resulting in a net realized gain on sale of 20,000.

Nonperforming loans include loans on nonaccrual status and loans delinquent more than 90 days but still accruing. As of December 31, 2022, nonperforming loans totaled 78,000, or 0.01 of
 total portfolio loans, compared to 92,000, or 0.01 of total portfolio loans, at December 31, 2021.

Nonperforming loans at December 31, 2022 consisted of 78,000 of residential mortgage loans.

Foreclosed and repossessed assets include assets acquired in settlement of loans. Foreclosed assets totaled 2.3 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021. All properties acquired through or in
 lieu of foreclosure are initially transferred at their fair value less estimated costs to sell and then evaluated monthly for impairment after transfer using a lower of cost or market approach. Updated property valuations are obtained at least
 annually on all foreclosed assets. On January 30, 2023, the Company sold the remaining other real estate owned property at a small gain, bringing the balance of other real estate owned to 0.

We had a total of 7.0 million and 7.5 million of loans classified as TDRs as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These loans may have involved the restructuring of terms to allow
 customers to mitigate the risk of foreclosure by meeting a lower loan payment requirement based upon their current cash flow. These may also include loans that renewed at existing contractual rates, but below market rates for comparable
 credit. For each restructuring, a comprehensive credit underwriting analysis of the borrower s financial condition and prospects of repayment under the revised terms is performed to assess whether the structure can be successful and that cash
 flows will be sufficient to support the restructured debt. An analysis is also performed to determine whether the restructured loan should be on accrual status. Generally, if the loan is on accrual at the time of restructure, it will remain
 on accrual after the restructuring. In some cases, a nonaccrual loan may be placed on accrual at restructuring if the loan s actual payment history demonstrates it would have cash flowed under the restructured terms. After six consecutive
 payments under the restructured terms, a nonaccrual restructured loan is reviewed for possible upgrade to accruing status. In situations where there is a subsequent modification or renewal and the loan is brought to market terms, including a
 contractual interest rate not less than a market interest rate for new debt with similar credit risk characteristics, the TDR and impaired designations may be removed.

As with other impaired loans, an allowance for loan loss is estimated for each TDR based on the most likely source of repayment for each loan. For impaired commercial real estate loans that
 are collateral dependent, the allowance is computed based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, less estimated costs to sell. For impaired commercial loans where repayment is expected from cash flows from business operations, the
 allowance is computed based on a discounted cash flow computation. Certain groups of TDRs, such as residential mortgages, have common characteristics and for them the allowance is computed based on a discounted cash flow computation on the
 change in weighted rate for the pool. The allowance allocations for commercial TDRs where we have reduced the contractual interest rate are computed by measuring cash flows using the new payment terms discounted at the original contractual
 rate.

Allowance for loan losses: Determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is highly subjective. Timely identification of risk rating
 changes within the commercial loan portfolio is key to our process of establishing an appropriate allowance balance. The internal risk rating system is discussed below.

The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2022 was 15.3 million, a decrease of 604,000, compared to 15.9 million at December 31, 2021. The balance of the allowance for loan losses was
 1.30 of total portfolio loans at December 31, 2022 compared to 1.43 of total portfolio loans at December 31, 2021. The allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loan coverage ratio remained high at 19,596 at December 31, 2022 compared to
 17,271 at December 31, 2021.

Nonperforming loans have been low over the past several years. At December 31, 2022, we have had net loan recoveries in thirty of the past thirty-two quarters. Perhaps even more
 importantly, our total delinquencies 30 days and greater have continued to be minimal, and were just 172,000 at December 31, 2022.

The provision for loan losses was a benefit of 1.1 million for 2022 compared to a benefit of 2.1 million for 2021. The provision in each period was impacted by the levels of nonperforming
 loans and net charge-off/recovery experience. We had net recoveries in 2022 totaling 521,000 compared to net recoveries of 531,000 in 2021. The ratio of net charge-offs / (recoveries) to average loans was (0.05 for 2022 compared to
 (0.04 for 2021.

We are encouraged by the low level of charge-offs over the past several years. We do, however, recognize that future charge-offs and resulting provisions for loan losses are expected to be
 impacted by the timing and extent of changes in the overall economy and the real estate markets.

Our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed appropriate based upon our assessment of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Our methodology for
 measuring the appropriate level of allowance and related provision for loan losses relies on several key elements, which include specific allowances for loans considered impaired, general allowance for commercial loans not considered impaired
 based upon applying our loan rating system, and general allocations based on historical trends for homogeneous loan groups with similar risk characteristics.

Impaired loans decreased 519,000 or 7 , to 7.0 million at December 31, 2022 compared to 7.5 million at December 31, 2021. The specific allowance for impaired loans decreased 270,000 to
 295,000, or 4.2 of total impaired loans, at December 31, 2022 compared to 565,000, or 7.5 of total impaired loans, at December 31, 2021.

Specific allowances are established on individually impaired credits where we believe it is probable that a loss may be incurred. Specific allowances are determined based on discounting
 estimated cash flows over the life of the loan or based on the fair value of collateral supporting the loan. For commercial real estate loans, generally appraisals are used to estimate the fair value of the collateral and determine the
 appropriate specific allowance. Estimated selling costs are also considered in the estimate. When it becomes apparent that liquidation of the collateral is the only source of repayment, the collateral shortfall is charged off rather than
 carried as a specific allowance.

The general allowance (referred to as formula allowance allocated to commercial loans that were not considered to be impaired was based upon the internal risk grade of such loans. We use
 a loan rating method based upon an eight point system. Loans are stratified between real estate secured and non-real estate secured. The real estate secured portfolio is further stratified by the type of real estate. Each stratified portfolio
 is assigned a loss allocation factor. Generally, a worse grade assigned to a loan category results in a greater allocation percentage. Changes in risk grade of loans affect the amount of the allowance allocation.

The determination of our loss factors is based upon our actual loss history by loan grade and adjusted for significant factors that, in management's judgment, affect the collectability of the
 portfolio as of the analysis date. We use a rolling 18 month (6 quarter) actual net charge-off history as the base for our computation for commercial loans. The 18 month period ended December 31, 2022 reflected net recoveries for most of our
 loan pools. We addressed this volatility in the qualitative factor considerations applied in our allowance computation. We also considered the extended period of improved asset quality in assessing the overall qualitative component.

We also have considered the effect of COVID-19 on our loan borrowers and our local economy. While significant stimulus and mitigation efforts were expected to soften the impact, we believed
 a downgrade to our economic qualitative factor was appropriate and we added 7 basis points to this qualitative factor at March 31, 2020. Additional allocations were provided in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020. In the first
 quarter of 2021, this factor was decreased by 2 basis points in recognition of improved economic conditions but additional allocations were made to other factors for a net increase of 8 basis points in the quarter. In the second quarter 2021,
 we added 20 basis points to our consumer loan portfolio qualitative factors to address the risk that economic impact payments may be masking consumer delinquency and default. We maintained these qualitative factors in the third and fourth
 quarters of 2021. Reflecting improvement in our local economy, in the fourth quarter of 2021 we reduced the overall economic qualitative factor by 6 basis points.

As the economy recovered in 2022 to pre-pandemic levels and losses did not occur, we determined it appropriate to reverse some of the qualitative factors allocated. In the first quarter of
 2022, we removed the 20 basis point allocation on consumer loans that was added in 2021 for economic impact payments possibly masking delinquencies. We also reduced the factor for economic conditions by 3 basis points, reduced the factor for
 changes in personnel by 4 basis points and added 2 basis points for the effect of rising interest rates. In the second quarter of 2022, we added 3 basis points for the effect of rising interest rates and reduced the factor for changes in
 personnel by 3 basis points. In the third quarter of 2022, we reduced the factor for credit quality trends by 2 basis points, reduced the factor for loan review quality by 1 basis point, reduced the factor for changes in lending personnel by 1
 basis point, reduced the factor for external conditions by 2 basis points and increased the factor for rising interest rates by 2 basis points. We increased the factor for rising interest rates by 2 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2022.

For the year, in 2022 we removed the 20 basis point allocation on consumer loans for economic impact payments, reduced economic trends by 3 basis points, reduced credit quality trends by 2
 basis points, reduced loan review quality by 1 basis point, reduced changes in personnel by 8 basis points, reduced external factors by 2 basis points and increased the effect of rising interest rates by 9 basis points.

Considering the change in our qualitative factors and changes in our commercial loan portfolio balances, the general commercial loan allowance decreased 178,000 to 12.8 million at December
 31, 2022 compared to 12.9 million at December 31, 2021. The qualitative component of our allowance allocated to commercial loans was 12.7 million at December 31, 2022, down from 12.9 million at December 31, 2021.

Groups of homogeneous loans, such as residential real estate and open- and closed-end consumer loans, receive allowance allocations based on loan type. A rolling 12 month (4 quarter)
 historical loss experience period was applied to residential mortgage and consumer loan portfolios. As with commercial loans that are not considered impaired, the determination of the allowance allocation percentage is based principally on our
 historical loss experience. These allocations are adjusted for consideration of general economic and business conditions, credit quality and delinquency trends, collateral values, and recent loss experience for these similar pools of loans. 
 The homogeneous loan allowance was 2.2 million at December 31, 2022 compared to 2.4 million at December 31, 2021.

As noted above, the formula allowance allocated to commercial loans that are not considered to be impaired is calculated by applying historical loss factors to outstanding loans based on the
 internal risk rating of such loans. We use a loan rating method based upon an eight point system. Loans rated a 4 or better are considered of acceptable risk. Loans rated a 5 exhibit above-normal risk to the Company and warrant a greater
 level of attention by management. These loans are subject to on-going review and assessment by our Administrative Loan Committee. Loans rated a 6 or worse are considered substandard, doubtful or loss, exhibit a greater relative risk of loss
 to the Company based upon the rating and warrant an active workout plan administered by our Special Asset Group.

The qualitative factors assessed and used to adjust historical loss experience reflect our assessment of the impact of economic trends, delinquency and other problem loan trends, trends in
 valuations supporting underlying collateral, changes in loan portfolio concentrations, effect of changes in interest rates on loan collectability, competition and changes in internal credit administration practices have on probable losses
 inherent in our loan portfolio. Qualitative adjustments are inherently subjective and there can be no assurance that these adjustments have properly identified probable losses in our loan portfolio. More information regarding the subjectivity
 involved in determining the estimate of the allowance for loan losses may be found in this Item 7 of this report under the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates."

With the exception of certain TDRs, impaired commercial loans at December 31, 2022 were classified as substandard or worse per our internal risk rating system. 2.7 million of residential
 mortgage TDRs were associated with programs approved by the U.S. government during 2009 to minimize the number of consumer foreclosures. These loans involved the restructuring of terms on consumer mortgages to allow customers to mitigate
 foreclosure by meeting a lower loan payment requirement based upon their current cash flow. Also included in this category are certain consumer home equity loans that were restructured maturing home equity lines of credit that did not qualify
 for traditional term financing. We have been actively working with our customers to reduce the risk of foreclosure using these programs. Additional information regarding impaired loans at December 31, 2022 and 2021 may be found in Item 8 of
 this report in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our weighted average loan grade was 3.60 at December 31, 2021 and 3.53 at December 31, 2022. The decrease of 452,000 in reserves on commercial loans for 2022 was due to a 252,000 decrease
 in specific reserves on impaired loans and a 200,000 decrease in the loss allocation factor on non-impaired loans at December 31, 2022.

Although we believe our allowance for loan losses has captured the losses that are probable in our portfolio as of December 31, 2022, there can be no assurance that all losses have been
 identified or that the allowance is sufficient.

Premises and Equipment: Premises and equipment totaled 40.3 million at December 31, 2022 compared to 41.8 million at December 31, 2021, down 1.5
 million, as capital additions were more than offset by depreciation of current property during 2022.

Bank owned life insurance (BOLI): The Bank has purchased life insurance policies on certain officers. BOLI is recorded at its currently realizable cash
 surrender value and totaled 53.3 million at December 31, 2022 compared to 52.5 million at December 31, 2021.

Deposits and Other Borrowings: Total deposits increased 37.2 million to 2.62 billion at December 31, 2022, as compared to 2.58 billion at December 31,
 2021. Noninterest checking account balances decreased 51.2 million in 2022. Interest bearing demand account balances increased 24.3 million and savings and money market account balances increased 56.9 million in 2022 while our certificates
 of deposit (primarily short-term) increased by 7.2 million in 2022. We believe our success in maintaining and increasing the balances of personal and business checking and savings accounts was primarily attributable to our focus on quality
 customer service, the desire of customers to deal with a local bank, the convenience of our branch network and the breadth and depth of our product line.

Noninterest bearing demand accounts comprised 31 of total deposits at December 31, 2022 compared to 34 of total deposits at December 31, 2021. Because of the generally low rates paid on
 interest bearing account alternatives, in recent years many of our business customers chose to keep their balances in these more liquid noninterest bearing demand account types. We started to see some shifting to higher paying interest
 accounts during 2022. Interest bearing demand, money market and savings accounts comprised 64 of total deposits at December 31, 2022 and 62 at December 31, 2021. Time accounts as a percentage of total deposits were 4 at December 31, 2022
 and 3 at December 31, 2021.

Borrowed funds totaled 30.0 million at December 31, 2022 comprised of 30.0 million in Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Borrowed funds totaled 85.0 million at December 31, 2021 including
 85.0 million of Federal Home Loan Bank advances. The decrease compared to December 31, 2021 was due to the FHLB exercising its put options on a 25.0 million advance carrying a rate of 0.01 and a 10.0 million advance carrying a rate of
 0.45 in the second quarter of 2022. In addition, during the second quarter of 2022, we prepaid 20.0 million in FHLB advances, with interest rates ranging from 2.91 to 3.05 . Prepayment fees totaled 87,000 and were included in interest
 expense in the second quarter 2022. Paying these advances off early will save us over 650,000 in annual interest expense, net of the prepayment fees incurred.

Information regarding our off-balance sheet commitments may be found in Item 8 of this report in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Total shareholders equity decreased by 7.0 million from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022. Shareholders equity was increased by 34.7 million of net income in 2022, partially offset
 by cash dividends of 10.9 million, or 0.32 per share. Shareholders equity decreased by 31.3 million in 2022 as a result of a negative swing in accumulated other comprehensive income due to the effect of rising interest rates on the fair
 value of our available for sale securities portfolio. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank was categorized as well capitalized under applicable regulatory guidelines.

Our regulatory capital ratios (on a consolidated basis) continue to significantly exceed the levels required to be categorized as well capitalized according to the requirements specified by
 the rules implementing Basel III.

Our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends to common shareholders beginning with the first quarter of 2014, and each subsequent quarter in 2014 through 2022. The declaration
 and payment of future dividends to common shareholders will be considered by the Board of Directors in its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition and anticipated profitability.

Capital sources include, but are not limited to, additional private and public common stock offerings, preferred stock offerings and subordinated debt.

LIQUIDITY 

Liquidity of Macatawa Bank: The liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to manage a variety of sources and uses of funds. Our Consolidated
 Statements of Cash Flows categorize these sources and uses into operating, investing and financing activities. We primarily focus on developing access to a variety of borrowing sources to supplement our deposit gathering activities and provide
 funds for our investment and loan portfolios. Our sources of liquidity include our borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank's discount window, the Federal Home Loan Bank, federal funds purchased lines of credit and other secured
 borrowing sources with our correspondent banks, loan payments by our borrowers, maturity and sales of our securities available for sale, growth of our deposits, federal funds sold and other short-term investments, and the various capital
 resources discussed above.

Liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of our customers. Our customers may be either borrowers with credit needs or depositors wanting to withdraw funds.
 Our liquidity management involves periodic monitoring of our assets considered to be liquid and illiquid, and our funding sources considered to be core and non-core and short-term (less than 12 months) and long-term. We have established
 parameters that monitor, among other items, our level of liquid assets to short-term liabilities, our level of non-core funding reliance and our level of available borrowing capacity. We maintain a diversified wholesale funding structure and
 actively manage our maturing wholesale sources to reduce the risk to liquidity shortages. We have also developed a contingency funding plan to stress test our liquidity requirements arising from certain events that may trigger liquidity
 shortages, such as rapid loan growth in excess of normal growth levels or the loss of deposits and other funding sources under extreme circumstances.

We maintain a non-core funding dependency ratio below our peer group average and have had no brokered deposits on our balance sheet since before December 2012. At December 31, 2022, the Bank
 held 704.0 million of federal funds sold and other short-term investments as well as 495.7 million of unpledged securities available for sale. In addition, the Bank s available borrowing capacity from correspondent banks was approximately
 307.9 million as of December 31, 2022.

In the normal course of business, we enter into certain contractual obligations, including obligations which are considered in our overall liquidity management.

In addition to normal loan funding, we also maintain liquidity to meet customer financing needs through unused lines of credit, unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit. The
 level and fluctuation of these commitments is also considered in our overall liquidity management. At December 31, 2022, we had a total of 745.7 million in unused lines of credit, 77.4 million in unfunded loan commitments and 13.5 million
 in standby letters of credit.

Liquidity of Holding Company: The primary sources of liquidity for the Company are dividends from the Bank, existing cash resources and the capital markets
 if the need to raise additional capital arises. Banking regulations and the laws of the State of Michigan in which our Bank is chartered limit the amount of dividends the Bank may declare and pay to the Company in any calendar year. Under the
 state law limitations, the Bank is restricted from paying dividends to the Company in excess of retained earnings. In 2021, the Bank paid dividends to the Company totaling 33.1 million. In the same period, the Company paid dividends to its
 shareholders totaling 10.9 million. In 2022, the Bank paid dividends to the Company totaling 11.9 million. In the same period, the Company paid dividends to its shareholders totaling 10.9 million. The Company retained the remaining
 balance in each period for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2022, the Bank had a retained earnings balance of 106.6 million.

During 2022 and 2021, the Company received payments from the Bank totaling 6.7 million and 8.0 million, respectively, representing the Bank s intercompany tax liability for the 2022 and
 2021 tax years, respectively, in accordance with the Company s tax allocation agreement.

The Company s cash balance at December 31, 2022 was 8.1 million. The Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES:

To prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management makes estimates and assumptions based on available
 information. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and future results could differ. The allowance for loan losses, other real estate owned valuation, loss contingencies and income taxes are
 deemed critical due to the required level of management judgment and the use of estimates, making them particularly subject to change.

Our methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses is described above in the "Allowance for Loan Losses" discussion. This area of
 accounting requires significant judgment due to the number of factors which can influence the collectability of a loan. Unanticipated changes in these factors could significantly change the level of the allowance for loan losses and the
 related provision for loan losses. Although, based upon our internal analysis, and in our judgment, we believe that we have provided an adequate allowance for loan losses, there can be no assurance that our analysis has properly identified all
 of the probable losses in our loan portfolio. As a result, we could record future provisions for loan losses that may be significantly different than the levels that we recorded in 2022.

Assets acquired through or instead of foreclosure, primarily other real estate owned, are initially recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost
 basis. New real estate appraisals are generally obtained at the time of foreclosure and are used to establish fair value. If fair value declines, a valuation allowance is recorded through expense. Estimating the initial and ongoing fair
 value of these properties involves a number of factors and judgments including holding time, costs to complete, holding costs, discount rate, absorption and other factors.

Loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. This, too, is an accounting area that
 involves significant judgment. Although, based upon our judgment, internal analysis, and consultations with legal counsel we believe that we have properly accounted for loss contingencies, future changes in the status of such contingencies
 could result in a significant change in the level of contingent liabilities and a related impact to operating earnings.

Our accounting for income taxes involves the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily associated with differences in the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses
 for financial reporting and tax purposes. At December 31, 2022, we had gross deferred tax assets of 11.9 million and gross deferred tax liabilities of 2.2 million resulting in a net deferred tax asset of 9.7 million. Accounting standards
 require that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a "more likely than not" standard. With the positive results in 2022
 and positive future projections, we concluded at December 31, 2022 that no valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset was required. Changes in tax laws, changes in tax rates, changes in ownership and our future level of earnings can
 impact the ultimate realization of our net deferred tax asset.

Item 7A. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk and, to a lesser extent, liquidity risk. All of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars with no specific foreign exchange
 exposure. Macatawa Bank has only limited agricultural-related loan assets, and therefore has no significant exposure to changes in commodity prices.

Our balance sheet has sensitivity, in various categories of assets and liabilities, to changes in prevailing rates in the U.S. for the federal funds rate, prime rate, mortgage rates, U.S.
 Treasury rates and various money market indexes. Our asset/liability management process aids us in providing liquidity while maintaining a balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities.

We utilize a simulation model as our primary tool to assess the direction and magnitude of variations in net interest income and the economic value of equity EVE resulting from potential
 changes in market interest rates. Key assumptions in the model include contractual cash flows and maturities of interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities, prepayment speeds on certain assets, and changes in market conditions
 impacting loan and deposit pricing. We also include pricing floors on discretionary priced liability products which limit how low various checking and savings products could go under declining interest rates. These floors reflect our pricing
 philosophy in response to changing interest rates.

We forecast the next twelve months of net interest income under an assumed environment of gradual changes in market interest rates under various scenarios. The resulting change in net
 interest income is an indication of the sensitivity of our earnings to directional changes in market interest rates. The simulation also measures the change in EVE, or the net present value of our assets and liabilities, under an immediate
 shift, or shock, in interest rates under various scenarios, as calculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using market-based discount rates.

If interest rates were to increase, this analysis suggests that we are positioned for an increase in net interest income over the next twelve months. If interest rates were to decrease, this
 analysis suggests that we are positioned for a decrease in net interest income over the next twelve months.

We also forecast the impact of immediate and parallel interest rate shocks on net interest income under various scenarios to measure the sensitivity of our earnings under extreme conditions.

The quarterly simulation analysis is monitored against acceptable interest rate risk parameters by the Asset/Liability Committee and reported to the Board of Directors.

In addition to changes in interest rates, the level of future net interest income is also dependent on a number of other variables, including: the growth, composition and absolute levels of
 loans, deposits, and other earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; economic and competitive conditions; potential changes in lending, investing and deposit gathering strategies; and client preferences.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

REPORT OF
 INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Shareholders and Board of Directors

Macatawa Bank Corporation

Holland, Michigan

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Macatawa Bank Corporation (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated
 statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the
 consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with
 accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the Company s internal control
 over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
 Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and our report dated February 16, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We
 are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
 Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
 about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
 performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
 principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or
 required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
 communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the
 critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Allowance for Loan Losses General Reserve

As described in Notes 1 and 3 to the Company s consolidated financial statements, the Company has a gross loan balance of 1.18 billion and related allowance for
 loan losses allowance balance of 15.3 million at December 31, 2022. The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. The general component covers non-impaired
 loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current qualitative environmental factors. The calculation of these qualitative environmental factors involves estimates and assumptions by management.

- 41 - 

Table of Contents 

We identified the qualitative environmental factors as a critical audit matter. Management s assumptions related to the qualitative environmental factors, which are
 used to adjust the quantitative historical loss (both upwards and downwards), are highly subjective and could have a significant impact on the allowance. Auditing these assumptions involves especially challenging and subjective auditor judgment.

The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:

Testing the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the data used by management to assess certain qualitative factors and their effect on the estimation of
 inherent losses within the loan portfolio.

Evaluating the reliability of the data and assumptions used by management to support their assessment of the qualitative factors by vouching to
 internal and external sources, including considerations of contradictory evidence.

Evaluating the reasonableness of management s conclusion on the qualitative assessment and the resulting adjustment to the allowance.

 annualized historical loss experience was used for commercial loans and a (four quarter) historical loss experience
 period was applied to residential mortgage and consumer loan portfolios. These historical loss percentages are adjusted (both upwards and downwards) for certain qualitative environmental factors, including economic trends, credit quality
 trends, valuation trends, concentration risk, quality of loan review, changes in personnel, competition, increasing interest rates, external factors and other considerations.

 loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported, net, at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing interest rate or at the fair value of collateral, less estimated costs
 to sell, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as consumer and residential real estate loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and, accordingly, they are not
 separately identified for impairment disclosures.

The resulting impact will be a decrease to the retained earnings account on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet equal to the after-tax impact of the increase in allowance
 balances, with the tax impact portion being recorded as a deferred tax asset on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company did not identify any available-for-sale debt securities requiring allowances to be established upon
 adoption of the standard on January 1, 2023. In addition, the Company evaluated its municipal bond securities and U.S.
 Treasury securities held to maturity on a pooled basis, determining that the securities in each pool share similar risks. The Company determined that on January 1, 2023, the municipal bond securities have a remote risk of loss and the
 government backed U.S. Treasury securities have a zero risk of loss. As such, the allowance for debt securities held to maturity established upon adoption of the standard on January 1, 2023 was immaterial .

and of specific reserves to customers whose loan terms have been modified in troubled debt restructurings TDRs as of December 31, 2022 and
 2021, respectively. These loans may have involved the restructuring of terms to allow customers to mitigate the risk of foreclosure by meeting a lower loan payment requirement based upon their current cash flow. These may also include loans
 that renewed at existing contractual rates, but below market rates for comparable credit. The Company has been active at utilizing these programs and working with its customers to reduce the risk of foreclosure. For commercial loans, these
 modifications typically include an interest only period and, in some cases, a lowering of the interest rate on the loan. In some cases, the modification will include separating the note into notes with the first note structured to be supported by current cash flows and collateral, and the second note made for the remaining unsecured debt. The second note
 is charged off immediately and collected only after the first note is paid in full. This modification type is commonly referred to as an A-B note structure. For consumer mortgage loans, the restructuring typically includes a lowering of the
 interest rate to provide payment and cash flow relief. For each restructuring, a comprehensive credit underwriting analysis of the borrower s financial condition and prospects of repayment under the revised terms is performed to assess
 whether the structure can be successful and that cash flows will be sufficient to support the restructured debt. An analysis is also performed to determine whether the restructured loan should be on accrual status. Generally, if the loan is
 on accrual at the time of restructure, it will remain on accrual after the restructuring. In some cases, a nonaccrual loan may be placed on accrual at restructuring if the loan s actual payment history demonstrates it would have cash flowed
 under the restructured terms. After consecutive payments under the restructured terms, a nonaccrual restructured loan is
 reviewed for possible upgrade to accruing status.

of performance in accordance with the
 new terms. The market rate relative to the borrower s credit risk is determined through analysis of market pricing information gathered from peers and use of a loan pricing model. The general objective of the model is to achieve a
 consistent return on equity from one credit to the next, taking into consideration differences in credit risk. In the model, credits with higher risk receive a higher potential loss allocation, and therefore require a higher interest rate to
 achieve the target return on equity.

point grading system, with grades 5 through 8 being considered classified, or watch, credits. All commercial loans are assigned a grade at origination, at each renewal or any
 amendment. When a credit is first downgraded to a watch credit (either through renewal, amendment, loan officer identification or the loan review process), an Administrative Loan Review ALR is generated by the credit department and the
 loan officer. All watch credits have an ALR completed monthly which analyzes the collateral position and cash flow of the borrower and its guarantors. The loan officer is required to complete both a short term and long term plan to
 rehabilitate or exit the credit and to give monthly comments on the progress to these plans. Management meets quarterly with loan officers to discuss each of these credits in detail and to help formulate solutions where progress has
 stalled. When necessary, the loan officer proposes changes to the assigned loan grade as part of the ALR. Additionally, Loan Review reviews all loan grades upon origination, renewal or amendment and again as loans are selected though the
 loan review process. The credit will stay on the ALR until either its grade has improved to a 4 or the credit relationship is at a zero balance. The Company uses the following definitions for the risk grades:

Controls and Procedures.

(a) 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

Under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), we conducted an evaluation of the
 effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), as of December 31, 2022. In designing and evaluating the
 disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as the Company s are
 designed to do, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating whether the benefits of the controls and procedures that the Company adopts outweigh their costs. Our management, including our CEO and CFO, after
 evaluating the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, have concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed
 by us in the reports that we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms.

(b) 

Changes in Internal Controls. 

There were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
 affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

(c) 

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s internal control system was designed by, or under
 the supervision of, our CEO and CFO and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements
 and related notes for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.

An internal control system, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
 that the control system s objectives have been met. The inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be deficient and breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes.

Company management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the
 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Company maintained
 effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on those criteria.

BDO USA, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included herein, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited Macatawa Bank Corporation s (the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal

Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria ). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
 over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria . 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31,
 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years then ended, and the related notes and our report dated February 16, 2023 expressed an
 unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
 reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
 are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
 Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
 assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
 weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
 believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
 statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
 reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
 accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
 regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
 subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
