Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Depositor and
the Trustee have complied with the Trust Agreement during the period covered by the Annual Report and Management s assertions
with respect to such compliance are fairly stated, in all material respects. An examination involves performing procedures to
obtain evidence about management s assertion. The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgement,
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of Management s assertion whether due to fraud or error,
and performing such other procedures as considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that the evidence we obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In
our opinion, the Depositor and the Trustee have complied, in all material respects, with the Trust Agreement during the period
covered by the Annual Report and Management s assertions with respect to such compliance are fairly stated, in all material
respects, for the year ended December 31, 2022.
