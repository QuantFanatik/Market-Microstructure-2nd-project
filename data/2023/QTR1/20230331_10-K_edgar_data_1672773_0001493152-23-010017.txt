Item
1. Business. 

Our
History 

We
were organized as a Delaware limited partnership on January 14, 2016 and are engaged in a single business segment, the ownership and
investment in leased equipment and related financings which includes: (i) purchasing equipment and leasing it to third-party end-users;
(ii) providing equipment and other asset financing; (iii) acquiring equipment subject to lease and (iv) acquiring ownership rights (residual
value interests) in leased equipment at lease expiration. We will terminate no later than December 31, 2040. 

The
General Partner of the Partnership is ASIF GP, LLC (the General Partner ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership s
Investment Manager, Arboretum Investment Advisors, LLC (the Investment Manager ). Both the Partnership s General Partner
and its Investment Manager are Delaware limited liability companies. The General Partner manages and controls the day to day activities
and operations of the Partnership, pursuant to the terms of the Partnership Agreement. The General Partner paid an aggregate capital
contribution of 100 for a 1 interest in the Partnership s income, losses and distributions. The Investment Manager makes all
investment decisions and manages the investment portfolio of the Partnership. 

3 

Our
income, losses and distributions are allocated 99 to the limited partners (the Limited Partners and 1 to the General
Partner until the Limited Partners have received total distributions equal to their capital contributions plus an 8 per year, compounded
annually, cumulative return on their capital contributions. After such time, all income, losses and distributable cash will be allocated
80 to the Limited Partners and 20 to the General Partner. We expect to conduct our activities for at least six years and divide our
life into three distinct stages: (i) the Offering Period, (ii) the Operating Period and (iii) the Liquidation Period. The Offering Period
began on August 11, 2016, and concluded on March 31, 2019. The Operating Period commenced on October 3, 2016 and concluded on October
3, 2021. During the Operating Period, we invested most of the net proceeds from our offering in business-essential, revenue-producing
(or cost-saving) equipment, other physical assets with substantial economic lives and, in many cases, associated revenue streams and
project financings. The Liquidation Period which commenced on October 4, 2021, is the period in which the portfolio will be liquidated
in the ordinary course of business and will last two years, unless it is extended, at the sole discretion of the General Partner. 

Our
Business 

Our
principal investment strategy is to invest in business-essential, revenue-producing (or cost-saving) equipment and other physical assets
with high in-place value and long, relative to the investment term, economic life and project financings. We expect to achieve our investment
strategy by making investments in equipment already subject to lease or originating equipment leases in such equipment, which will include:
(i) purchasing equipment and leasing it to third-party end-users; (ii) providing equipment and other asset financing; (iii) acquiring
equipment subject to lease and (iv) acquiring ownership rights (residual value interests) in leased equipment at lease expiration. From
time to time, we may also purchase equipment and sell it directly to our leasing customers. 

Our
fund operates under a structure in which we pool the capital invested by our Limited Partners. This pool of capital is then used to invest
in business-essential, revenue-producing (or cost-saving) equipment and other physical assets with substantial economic lives and, in
many cases, associated revenue streams. The pooled capital contributions are also used to pay fees and expenses associated with our organization
and to fund a capital reserve. 

Many
of our investments are anticipated to be structured as full payout or operating equipment leases and loans. In addition, we invest by
way of participation agreements and residual sharing agreements where we acquire an interest in a pool of equipment or other assets or
rights to the equipment or other assets, at a future date. We also structure investments as project financings that are secured by, among
other things, essential use equipment and/or assets. Finally, we use other investment structures, such as vendor and rental programs
that our Investment Manager believes will provide us the appropriate level of security, collateralization, and flexibility to optimize
our return on investment while protecting against downside risk. In most cases, the structure includes us holding title to or a priority
position in the equipment or other assets. 

Although
the final composition of our portfolio cannot be determined at this stage, we expect to invest in equipment and other assets that are
considered essential use or core to a business or operation in the agricultural, energy, environmental, medical, manufacturing, technology,
and transportation industries. Our Investment Manager may identify other assets or industries that meet our investment objectives. We
expect to invest in equipment, other assets, and project financings located primarily within the United States of America and the European
Union but may also make investments in other parts of the world. 

The
life cycle of our fund is divided into three distinct stages: (i) the Offering Period, (ii) the Operating Period and (iii) the Liquidation
Period. Our Offering period commenced on August 11, 2016 and concluded on March 31, 2019. We have been approved for sale under Blue Sky
regulations in 49 states and the District of Columbia. During the Offering Period, the majority of our cash inflows were derived from
financing activities and were the direct result of capital contributions from Limited Partners. 

4 

During
the Operating Period, we plan to make quarterly distributions of cash to our Limited Partners, if, in the opinion of our Investment Manager,
such distributions are in our best interests. Therefore, the amount and rate of cash distributions could vary and are not guaranteed.
The targeted distribution rate is 6.0 annually, paid quarterly as 1.5 , of each Limited Partner s capital contribution (pro-rated
to the date of admission for each Limited Partner). Beginning as of June 30, 2017, our distribution rate was 6.5 annually, paid quarterly
at 1.625 of capital contributions. Beginning as of March 31, 2018, we increased our distribution to 7.0 annually, paid quarterly at
1.75 of capital contributions. Beginning as of June 30, 2018, we increased our distribution to 7.5 , paid quarterly at 1.875 of capital
contributions. Beginning as of September 30, 2018 we increased our distribution to 8.0 , paid quarterly at 2.00 of capital contributions.
Beginning as of June 30, 2020, we decreased our distribution to 4.0 , paid quarterly at 1.00 of capital contributions. In 2021 we paid
one quarterly distribution at 1.00 of capital contributions, and in 2022 we did not pay any distributions. 

From
August 11, 2016 through March 31, 2019, we admitted 617 Limited Partners with total capital contributions of 25,371,709 resulting in
the sale of 2,537,170.91 Units. We received cash contributions of 24,718,035 and applied 653,674 which would have otherwise been paid
as sales commission to the purchase of 65,367.46 additional Units. 

A
Limited Partner may not redeem its Units without the prior written consent of our General Partner. Our General Partner has the sole discretion
to approve or deny any redemption requested by a Limited Partner. 

At
December 31, 2022, we had total assets of 15,307,787. Of this amount, 10,073,292 was for various investments: 9,804,649 related to
investments in finance leases and 268,643 related to collateralized loans receivables. We also had other assets of 5,085,005. For the
year ended December 31, 2022, we had net loss of 1,580,761. 

At
December 31, 2021, we had total assets of 24,712,208. Of this amount, 18,719,969 was for various investments: 17,749,004 related to
investments in finance leases and 970,965 related to collateralized loans receivables. We also had other assets of 5,797,559. For the
year ended December 31, 2021, we had net income of 240,851.

Segment
Information 

We
are engaged in a single business segment, the ownership and investment in leased equipment, which includes: (i) purchasing equipment
and leasing it to third-party end users; (ii) providing equipment and other asset financing; (iii) acquiring equipment subject to lease;
and (iv) acquiring ownership rights (residual value interests) in leased equipment at lease expiration. From time to time, we may also
purchase equipment and sell it directly to our leasing customers.

Competition 

The
commercial leasing and financing industry is highly competitive and is characterized by competitive factors that vary based upon product
and geographic region. Our competitors are varied and include other equipment leasing and finance funds, hedge funds, private equity
funds, captive and independent finance companies, commercial and industrial banks, manufacturers and vendors. 

Other
equipment finance companies and equipment manufacturers or their affiliated financing companies may be in a position to offer equipment
to prospective customers on financial terms that are more favorable than those that we can offer. There are numerous other potential
entities, including entities organized and managed similarly to us, seeking to make investments in leased equipment. Many of these potential
competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than us. 

We
compete primarily on the basis of terms and structure, particularly on structuring flexible, responsive, and customized financing solutions
for our customers. Our investments are often made directly rather than through competition in the open market. This approach limits the
competition for our typical investment, which may enhance returns. We believe our investment model may represent the best way for individual
investors to participate in investing in leased or financed equipment. Nevertheless, to the extent that our competitors compete aggressively
on any combination of the foregoing factors, we could fail to achieve our investment objectives. 

Employees 

We
have no direct employees. Our General Partner and/or our Investment Manager supervise and control our business affairs and service our
investments.

Title of Class 
 Number of Partners at March 31, 2023 
 
 General Partner 
 1 
 
 Limited Partners 
 613 

We
pay, at the sole discretion of our Investment Manager and contingent upon the availability of funds, quarterly cash distributions to
each Limited Partner computed at 1.5 (pro-rated to the date of admission for each Limited Partner) of each Limited Partner s capital
contribution. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we didn t make a cash distributions to our Limited Partners. During the
year ended December 31, 2021, we made quarterly cash distributions to our Limited Partners totaling approximately 323,000. At December
31, 2022 and 2021, the Partnership did not declare or accrue distributions due to the economic uncertainties from COVID-19. At December
31, 2022 and 2021 we declared and accrued a distribution of 0 and 637, respectively, for distributions due to our General Partner which
resulted in distributions payable to our General Partner of 49,335 at December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

We
are required pursuant to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. FINRA Rule 2310(b)(5) to disclose in each annual
report distributed to our Limited Partners a per Unit estimated value of our Units, the method by which we developed the estimated value,
and the date used to develop the estimated value. In addition, our Investment Manager prepares statements of our estimated Unit values
to assist fiduciaries of retirement plans subject to the annual reporting requirements of ERISA in the preparation of their reports relating
to an investment in our Units. For these purposes, the estimated value of our Units is 6.34 per Unit at December 31, 2022. This estimated
value is provided to assist plan fiduciaries in fulfilling their annual valuation and reporting responsibilities and should not be used
for any other purpose. Because this is only an estimate, we may subsequently revise this estimated value. There is no significant public
trading market for our Units at this time and none is expected to develop. There can be no assurance that Limited Partners could receive
 6.34 per Unit if such a market did exist and they sold their Units, or that they will be able to receive such amount for their Units
in the future. At December 31, 2022, we were in our Liquidation Period which began on October 4, 2021. Our Operating Period began on
October 3, 2016 and concluded on October 3, 2021. Our Offering Period began on August 11, 2016 and concluded on March 31, 2019. 

Following
the completion of our Offering Period, the estimated value of our Units will be based on a valuation performed at least annually. When
conducting such valuation, there are currently no SEC, federal and state rules that establish requirements specifying the methodology
to employ in determining an estimated per Unit value; provided, however, that the determination of the estimated per Unit value must
be conducted by, or with the material assistance or confirmation of, a third-party valuation expert or service and must be derived from
a methodology that conforms to standard industry practice. The valuation will be an estimate only, will be subject to various limitations
and will be based on a number of assumptions and estimates that may or may not be accurate or complete. If we provide an estimated per
Unit value of our Units based on a valuation prior to the conclusion of our offering, our General Partner may determine to modify the
offering price to reflect the estimated value per Unit. 

The
redemption price we offer to repurchase our Units utilizes a different valuation methodology than that which we use to determine the
current value of our Units for ERISA and FINRA purposes described above. Therefore, the 6.34 per Unit does not reflect the amount that
a Limited Partner should expect to receive under our redemption plan. In addition, there can be no assurance that a Limited Partner will
be able to redeem their Units under our redemption plan. A Limited Partner may not redeem their Units without the prior written consent
of our General Partner. Our General Partner has the sole discretion to approve or deny any redemption requested by any of our Limited
Partners.

Overview 

We
are a Delaware limited partnership formed on January 14, 2016. Our fund operates under a structure which pools the capital invested by
our partners. This pool of capital is then used to invest in business-essential, revenue-producing (or cost-saving) equipment and other
physical assets with substantial economic lives and, in many cases, associated revenue streams and project financings. The pooled capital
contributions are also used to pay fees and expenses associated with our organization and to fund a capital reserve. 

Our
principal investment strategy is to invest in business-essential, revenue-producing (or cost-savings) equipment with high in-place value
and long, relative to the investment term, economic life and project financings. We expect to achieve our investment strategy by making
investments in equipment already subject to lease or originating equipment leases in such equipment, which will include: (i) purchasing
equipment and leasing it to third-party end users; (ii) providing equipment and other asset financing; (iii) acquiring equipment subject
to lease; and (iv) acquiring ownership rights (residual value interests) in leased equipment at lease expiration. From time to time,
we may also purchase equipment and sell it directly to our leasing customers. 

12 

Many
of our investments will be structured as full payout or operating leases. Full payout leases generally are leases under which the rent
over the initial term of the lease will return our invested capital plus an appropriate return without consideration of the residual
value, and where the lessee may acquire the equipment or other assets at the expiration of the lease term. Operating leases generally
are leases under which the aggregate non-cancelable rental payments during the original term of the lease, on a net present value basis,
are not sufficient to recover the purchase price of the equipment or other assets leased under the lease. 

We
also intend to invest by way of loans, participation agreements and residual sharing agreements where we would acquire an interest in
a pool of equipment or other assets, or rights to the equipment or other assets, at a future date. We also may structure investments
as project financings that are secured by, among other things, essential use equipment and/or assets. Finally, we may use other investment
structures that our Investment Manager believes will provide us with the appropriate level of security, collateralization, and flexibility
to optimize our return on our investment while protecting against downside risk, such as vendor and rental programs. In many cases, the
structure will include us holding title to or a priority or controlling position in the equipment or other asset. 

We
invested in equipment and other assets that are considered essential use or core to a business or operation in the agricultural, energy,
environmental, medical, manufacturing, technology, and transportation industries. Our Investment Manager may identify other assets or
industries that meet our investment objectives. We expect to invest in equipment, other assets and project financings located primarily
within the United States of America and the European Union but may also make investments in other parts of the world. 

We
are currently in the Liquidation Period. The Operating Period concluded on October 3, 2021. The Offering Period concluded on March 31,
2019. During the Operating Period, we invested most of the net proceeds from our offering in business-essential, revenue-producing (or
cost-saving) equipment, other physical assets with substantial economic lives and, in many cases, associated revenue streams and project
financings. The Operating Period began on the date we admitted our first Limited Partners, at the initial closing, which occurred on
October 3, 2016 and concluded on October 3, 2021. At our initial closing, we reimbursed our Investment Manager for a portion of the fees
and expenses associated with our organization and offering which they previously paid on our behalf and we funded a small capital reserve.
The Liquidation Period, which began on October 4, 2021, is the period in which we will sell assets in the ordinary course of business
and will last two years, unless it is extended, at the sole discretion of the General Partner. 

Our
General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates, and certain non-affiliates (namely, Selling Dealers) receive fees and compensation
from the offering of our Units, including the following, with any and all compensation paid to our General Partner solely in cash. We
pay an underwriting fee of 2 of the gross proceeds of the offering (excluding proceeds, if any, we receive from the sale of our Units
to our General Partner or its affiliates) to our selling agent or selling agents. From these underwriting fees, a selling agent may pay
Selling Dealers, a non-accountable marketing fee based upon such factors as the volume of sales of such Selling Dealers, the level of
marketing support provided by such participating dealers and the assistance of such Selling Dealers in marketing the offering, or to
reimburse representatives of such Selling Dealers for the costs and expenses of attending our educational conferences and seminars. This
fee will vary, depending upon separately negotiated agreements with each Selling Dealer. In addition, we pay a sales commission to Selling
Dealers up to 5 of the gross proceeds of the offering (excluding proceeds, if any, we receive from the sale of our Units to our General
Partner or its affiliates). 

Our
General Partner receives an organizational and offering expense allowance of up to 1.5 of our offering proceeds to reimburse it for
expenses incurred in preparing us for registration or qualification under federal and state securities laws and subsequently offering
and selling our Units. The organizational and offering expense allowance will be paid out of the proceeds of the offering. The organizational
and offering expense allowance will not exceed the actual fees and expenses incurred by our General Partner and its affiliates. Because
organizational and offering expenses will be paid as and to the extent they are incurred, organizational and offering expenses may be
drawn disproportionately to the gross proceeds of each closing. 

13 

During
our Operating Period, our Investment Manager received a structuring fee in an amount equal to 1.5 of each cash investment made, including
reinvestments, payable on the date each such investment is made. 

During
our Operating Period and our Liquidation Period, our Investment Manager receives a management fee in an amount equal to the greater of
(i) 2.5 per annum of the aggregate offering proceeds, payable monthly in advance or (ii) 62,500 per month. Effective January 1, 2023, the Investment Manager reduced the management fee from 62,500 per month 750,000 per
annum) to 50,000 per month 600,000 per annum). 

Our
General Partner will initially receive 1 of all distributed distributable cash. Our General Partner has a Promotional Interest in us
equal to 20 of all distributed distributable cash after we have provided a return to our Limited Partners of their respective capital
contributions plus an 8 per annum, compounded annually, cumulative return on their capital contributions. 

Current
Business Environment and Outlook 

We
believe that 2023 will present attractive opportunities for equipment lease and asset finance investments. Despite rising interest rates
and the threat of an economic downturn, companies continue to invest in equipment and technology to meet demand. The U.S. economy expanded
in the third quarter of 2022 after two consecutive quarters of contraction. Growth was fueled by strong net exports, solid consumer spending,
and robust equipment investment. Meanwhile, residential investment and business inventories were drags on growth. Alarm bells were ringing
throughout much of 2022 as the economy contracted during the first half of the year, elevating fears of an imminent recession. However,
the economy bounced back in Q3 as the labor market remained strong and consumers held firm despite high inflation. In addition to strong
job growth, the economy is finally benefitting from the normalization of supply chains after two years of turmoil. Meanwhile, most measures
of financial stress, including consumer and business delinquencies and defaults, as well as home foreclosures and bankruptcies, remain
subdued. On the other hand, inflation remains stubbornly high, and the Fed is committed to reining it in even if this leads to job losses
or an outright recession. The housing market predictably suffered as the cost of borrowing increased, and the consumer savings rate has
plummeted to less than half its pre-pandemic level, suggesting that a pullback in spending could be just around the corner. Though recent
data offer some hope that the Fed may yet be able to achieve its desired soft landing, many economists and business leaders
remain unconvinced. There are several factors that may make the looming downturn less severe for the equipment finance industry, including
pro industrial legislation, equipment order backlogs and reshoring trends. The labor market remains a key point of strength. The economy
added a consensus-beating 261k jobs in November 2022 and, despite easing slightly in October, job openings remain far above pre-pandemic
levels (see chart). Further, the unemployment rate held at 3.7 in November, quelling fears that rising interest rates would lead to
widespread job loss (at least for now). In short: the labor market is strong, and there are few signs that it is slowing. However, the
historically strong labor market is a double edged sword for the economy given current inflation levels. Wage growth accelerated in the
latest reading and is now running at a nearly 6 annualized rate over the last three months. While this pace of growth is welcome news
for workers and will help households absorb high inflation, the fact that wage growth appears to be accelerating is the exact opposite
of what the Fed wants to see, as it suggests that additional rate hikes are needed to slow the economy and bring inflation closer to
its target level. The pandemic fundamentally altered the globally distributed, just-in-time supply chain model for manufacturing. Companies
that relied on China and other east Asian countries for inputs were left scrambling as global supply chains seized up. Further, just
as things seemed to be improving in early 2022, Russia s invasion of Ukraine introduced a new geopolitical risk factor, further
complicating supply chains and driving up oil prices (and, by extension, transportation costs) in the process. Going forward, many large
corporations are in the process of near-shoring and/or re-shoring elements of their supply chains in order
to minimize these risks. Manufacturing firms intend to move capacity to the United States or are considering it, and nearly one quarter
of their Asia-originating freight is expected to shift to the Americas by 2025. Several pieces of pro-industrial legislation will help
propel this historic transition. All told, the turmoil that global manufacturing firms have endured because of the pandemic and geopolitical
developments have triggered a paradigm shift in global supply chains. The United States stands to benefit from these events, and equipment
markets should see a boost in demand, which in turn should lead to new opportunities for the equipment fianc industry. Congress
managed to pass three major bills over the last 12 months: the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), the CHIPS and Science Act
(CHIPS), and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Collectively, these bills authorize at least 600 billion in new funding for a variety
of industrial and infrastructure projects and should provide a sharp boost to equipment investment. The new federal funds, which will
be disbursed through a combination of direct spending, grants awards, and tax credits, will be dedicated to expanding transportation
infrastructure, semiconductor manufacturing plants, and energy infrastructure. After many years of the manufacturing sector shrinking
as a share of the U.S. economy, these initiatives, along with increased wariness of depending on China s manufacturing sector due
to the pandemic and geopolitical concerns, could be the catalyst for reversing course. Indeed, while most of this funding has not yet
been appropriated, several international manufacturers, including Intel, Micron, and GlobalFoundries, have already announced multibillion
dollar investments in their U.S. manufacturing footprints. Most of the funding from these bills will be distributed over the next five
years, and as such they should help backstop the U.S. manufacturing sector and increase the demand for equipment in 2023 and beyond.
Overall we think that businesses have a positive outlook for growth in the latter half of 2023 and we anticipate capital asset and equipment
acquisition will be an essential part of that growth.

Current
Industry Trends 

According
to the Equipment Leasing and Finance Foundation s 2023 Equipment Leasing and Financing U.S. Economic Outlook the
U.S. economy s growth in 2023 is poised to experience growth of 0.9 while equipment and software investment should expand by about
4.2 . Equipment and software investment growth boomed in the second half of 2022 with nearly 12 annualized growth in Q3, providing a
solid jumping-off point for 2023. However, rising interest rates are expected to weigh on investment growth next year. The U.S. economy
also saw GDP growth bounce back during the second half of 2022, although underlying conditions remain troubling. The housing market is
struggling, financial markets are highly volatile, and the global economy is slowing. The manufacturing sector continues to outperform
expectations given rising interest rates and the global economic slowdown. Although activity appears likely to slow in 2023 given expectations
for a recession, recent pro-industrial legislation and a push for supply chain re-shoring should give the manufacturing sector a boost.
For Main Street businesses, the combined effects of high inflation and tightening financial conditions are likely to contribute to turbulent
operating conditions in 2023. Fortunately, financial stress is still quite low and small business lending activity remains positive for
now. Monetary policy is among the biggest questions facing the equipment finance industry in 2023. The Fed has hinted at the possibility
of slowing down interest rate hikes, while stressing it is committed to reining in inflation at the risk of higher unemployment or a
recession. Interest rate levels are expected to rise above 5 next year, and potentially higher.

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

An
understanding of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results. The preparation of financial statements
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our General Partner and our Investment
Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Significant estimates will primarily include the determination of allowance for notes and leases, depreciation and amortization, impairment
losses and the estimated useful lives and residual values of the leased equipment we acquire. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. 

Lease
Classification and Revenue Recognition 

Each
equipment lease we enter into is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, which is determined at lease inception,
based upon the terms of each lease, or when there are significant changes to the lease terms. We capitalize initial direct costs associated
with the origination and funding of lease assets. Initial direct costs include both internal costs (e.g., labor and overhead), if any,
and external broker fees incurred with the lease origination. Costs related to leases that are not consummated are not eligible for capitalization
as initial direct costs and are expensed as incurred as acquisition expense. For a finance lease, initial direct costs are capitalized
and amortized over the lease term using the effective interest rate method. For an operating lease, the initial direct costs are included
as a component of the cost of the equipment and depreciated over the lease term. 

For
finance leases, we record, at lease inception, the total minimum lease payments receivable from the lessee, the estimated unguaranteed
residual value of the equipment at lease termination, the initial direct costs related to the lease, if any, and the related unearned
income. Unearned income represents the difference between the sum of the minimum lease payments receivable, plus the estimated unguaranteed
residual value, minus the cost of the leased equipment. Unearned income is recognized as finance income over the term of the lease using
the effective interest rate method. 

For
operating leases, rental income is recognized on the straight-line basis over the lease term. Billed operating lease receivables are
included in accounts receivable until collected. Accounts receivable is stated at its estimated net realizable value. Deferred revenue
is the difference between the timing of the receivables billed and the income recognized on the straight-line basis. 

Our
Investment Manager has an investment committee that approves each new equipment lease and other financing transaction. As part of its
process, the investment committee determines the residual value, if any, to be used once the investment has been approved. The factors
considered in determining the residual value include, but are not limited to, the creditworthiness of the potential lessee, the type
of equipment considered, how the equipment is integrated into the potential lessee s business, the length of the lease, the industry
in which the potential lessee operates and the secondary market value of the equipment. Residual values are reviewed for impairment in
accordance with our impairment review policy. 

16 

The
residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset will be utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market. Short-term
fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number
of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly. The residual value is calculated using information
from various external sources, such as trade publications, auction data, equipment dealers, wholesalers and industry experts, as well
as inspection of the physical asset and other economic indicators. 

Long-lived
Asset Impairments 

The
Partnership assesses the impairment of long-lived assets with determinable useful lives whenever events or changes in business circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable (a triggering event). When such events occur, management determines
whether there has been impairment by comparing the anticipated undiscounted net future cash flows to the related asset s carrying
value. If impairment exists, the asset is written down to its estimated carrying value. Impairment loss for long-lived assets was recorded in the amount of 875,000
and 443,605 for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Collateralized
Loans Receivable, net 

Collateralized
loans receivable are reported in our balance sheets at the outstanding principal balance net of any unamortized deferred fees, premiums
or discounts on purchased notes and loans. Costs to originated notes, if any, are reported as other assets in our balance sheets. Unearned
income, discounts and premiums, if any, are amortized to interest income in the statements of operations using the effective interest
rate method. Collateralized loans receivable are generally placed in a non-accrual status when payments are more than 90 days past due.
Additionally, we periodically review the creditworthiness of companies with payments outstanding less than 90 days. Based upon the Investment
Manager s judgment, accounts may be placed in a non-accrual status. Accounts on a non-accrual status are only returned to an accrual
status when the account has been brought current and we believe recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable. Revenue on non-accrual
accounts is recognized only when cash has been received. 

Finance
Lease Receivables and Allowance for Loan and Lease Accounts 

In
the normal course of business, the Partnership provides credit or financing to its customers, performs credit evaluations of these customers,
and maintains reserves for potential credit losses. These credit or financing transactions are normally collateralized by the equipment
being financed. In determining the amount of allowance for doubtful lease, notes and loan accounts, the Investment Manager considers
historical credit losses, the past due status of receivables, payment history, and other customer-specific information, including the
value of the collateral. The past due status of a receivable is based on its contractual terms. Expected credit losses are recorded as
an allowance for doubtful lease, notes and loan accounts. Receivables are written off when the Investment Manager determines they are
uncollectible. There was no impairment loss for collateralized loan receivable or finances
leases for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Business
Overview 

Our
Offering Period commenced on August 11, 2016 and concluded on March 31, 2019. We have been approved for sale under Blue Sky regulations
in 49 states and the District of Columbia. During the Offering Period, the majority of our cash inflows were derived from financing activities
and were the direct result of capital contributions from Limited Partners. 

During
our Operating Period, which began on October 3, 2016 and concluded on October 3, 2021, we used the majority of our net offering proceeds
from Limited Partner capital contributions to acquire our initial investments. As our investments mature, we anticipate reinvesting the
cash proceeds in additional investments in leased equipment and financing transactions, to the extent that the cash will not be needed
for expenses, reserves and distributions to our Limited Partners. During this time-frame we expect both rental income and finance income
to increase substantially as well as related expenses such as depreciation and amortization. During the Operating Period, we believe
the majority of our cash outflows will be from investing activities as we acquire additional investments and to a lesser extent from
financing activities from our paying quarterly distributions to our Limited Partners. Our cash flow from operations is expected to increase,
primarily from the collection of rental and interest payments. 

Results
of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 

We
are currently in our Liquidation Period. The Offering Period was declared effective by the SEC on August 11, 2016, and concluded on March
31, 2019. The Operating Period began on the date we admitted our first Limited Partners, at the initial closing, which occurred on October
3, 2016 and concluded on October 3, 2021. At our initial closing, we reimbursed our Investment Manager for a portion of the fees and
expenses associated with our organization and offering which they previously paid on our behalf and we funded a small capital reserve.
The Liquidation Period, which began on October 4, 2021, is the period in which we will sell assets in the ordinary course of business
and will last two years, unless it is extended, at the sole discretion of the General Partner. Through December 31, 2022, the Partnership
admitted 617 Limited Partners with total capital contributions of 25,371,709 resulting in the sale of 2,537,170.91 Units. The Partnership
received cash contributions of 24,718,035 and applied 653,674 which would have otherwise been paid as sales commission to the purchase
of 65,367.46 additional Units. 

The
Operating Period is defined as the period in which we invest the net proceeds from the Offering Period into business-essential, revenue-producing
(or cost-saving) equipment and other physical assets with substantial economic lives and, in many cases, associated revenue streams.
During this period we anticipate substantial cash outflows from investing activities as we acquire leased and financed equipment. We
also expect our operating activities to generate cash inflows during this time as we collect rental payments from the leased and financed
assets we acquire.

Sources
of Liquidity 

We
are currently in our Liquidation Period. The Offering Period is the time frame in which we raise capital contributions from Limited Partners
through the sale of our Units. As such, during our Offering Period a substantial portion of our cash inflows were from financing activities.
The Operating Period is the time frame in which we acquire equipment under lease or enter into other equipment financing transactions.
During this time period a substantial portion of our cash out-flows were for investing activities. We believe that cash inflows will
be sufficient to finance our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future, including quarterly distributions to our Limited Partners,
general and administrative expenses and fees paid to our Investment Manager. 

Operating
Activities 

Cash
provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 811,104 and was primarily driven by the following factors:
impairment of 875,000, an increase in other assets of approximately 1,705,000, and an increase
in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of approximately 74,000. Offsetting these fluctuations was a net loss for the year ended
December 31, 2022 of approximately 1,581,000, a decrease in deferred revenue of approximately 194,000 and a decrease in accrued interest
of approximately 44,000. We expect our accounts payable and accrued expenses will fluctuate from period to period primarily due to the
timing of payments related to lease and financings transactions. We anticipate that we will generate greater net cash inflows from operations
principally from rental payments received from lessees. 

Cash
provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 3,023,860 and was primarily driven by the following factors:
net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 of approximately 241,000, impairment of approximately 444,000,
an increase in other assets of approximately 2,248,000, and an increase in deferred revenue of approximately 73,000. Offsetting these
fluctuations was a decrease in accrued interest on loans payable of approximately 46,000 and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued
liabilities of approximately 11,000. We expect our accounts payable and accrued expenses will fluctuate from period to period primarily
due to the timing of payments related to lease and financings transactions. We anticipate that we will generate greater net cash inflows

minimum rental payments from finance leases, offset by approximately 3,016,000 in net cash received from origination and purchases of
loans receivable, prepayments and satisfactions. 

Financing
Activities 

Cash
used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 7,635,131 and was primarily due to cash received from loan payable
of 2,050,000, offset by payments of approximately 9,647,000 on the loan payable. 

Cash
used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 4,507,105 and was primarily due to cash received from loan payable
of 12,560,000, offset by payments of approximately 16,701,000 on the loan payable, and 366,000 in distributions and redemptions to
limited partners. 

Distributions 

During
our Operating Period, we intend to pay cash distributions on a quarterly basis to our Limited Partners at 1.5 per quarter, the equivalent
rate of 6.0 per annum, of each Limited Partners capital contribution (pro-rated to the date of admission for each Limited Partner).
Beginning as of June 30, 2017, our distribution rate was 6.5 annually, paid quarterly at 1.625 , of capital contributions. Beginning as of
March 31, 2018, we increased our distribution to 7.0 annually, paid quarterly at 1.75 of capital contributions. Beginning as of June
30, 2018, we increased our distribution to 7.5 , paid quarterly at 1.875 of capital contributions. Beginning as of September 30, 2018
we increased our distribution to 8.0 , paid quarterly at 2.00 of capital contributions. Beginning as of June 30, 2020, we decreased
our distribution to 4.0 , paid quarterly at 1.00 of capital contributions. The amount and rate of cash distributions could vary and
are not guaranteed. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we didn t make a cash distributions to our Limited Partners. During
the year ended December 31, 2021, we made quarterly cash distributions to our Limited Partners totaling approximately 323,000. At December
31, 2022 and 2021, the Partnership did not declare or accrue distributions due to the economic uncertainties from COVID-19. At December
31, 2022 and 2021 we declared and accrued a distribution of 0 and 637, respectively, for distributions due to our General Partner which
resulted in distributions payable to our General Partner of 49,335 at December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Commitments
and Contingencies 

Commitment
and Contingencies 

Our
income, losses and distributions are allocated 99 to our Limited Partners and 1 to our General Partner until the Limited Partners have
received total distributions equal to each Limited Partners capital contribution plus an 8 , compounded annually, cumulative return
on each Limited Partners capital contribution. After such time, income, losses and distributions will be allocated 80 to our
Limited Partners and 20 to our General Partner. 

We
enter into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. Our maximum exposure under these arrangements is not known. 

In
the normal course of business, we enter into contracts of various types, including lease contracts, contracts for the sale or purchase
of leased assets, loan agreements and management contracts. It is prevalent industry practice for most contracts of any significant value
to include provisions that each of the contracting parties, in addition to assuming liability for breaches of the representations, warranties,
and covenants that are part of the underlying contractual obligations, to also assume an obligation to indemnify and hold the other contractual
party harmless for such breaches, and for harm caused by such party s gross negligence and willful misconduct, including, in certain
instances, certain costs and expenses arising from the contract. Generally, to the extent these contracts are performed in the ordinary
course of business under the reasonable business judgment of our General Partner and our Investment Manager, no liability will arise
as a result of these provisions. Should any such indemnification obligation become payable, we would separately record and/or disclose
such liability in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Item
7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk. 

We,
like most other companies, are exposed to certain market risks, which include changes in interest rates and the demand for equipment
owned by us. We believe that our exposure to other market risks, including commodity risk and equity price risk, are insignificant at
this time to both our financial position and our results of operations. 

Our
Investment Manager has evaluated the impact of the condition of the credit markets on our future cash flows and we do not believe that
we will experience any material adverse impact on our cash flows should credit conditions in general remain the same or deteriorate. 

We
manage our exposure to equipment and residual risk by monitoring the markets our equipment is in and maximizing remarketing proceeds
through the re-lease or sale of equipment.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Partners of Arboretum Silverleaf Income Fund, L.P. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Arboretum Silverleaf Income Fund, L.P. (the Partnership as of December
31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, changes in partners equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion,
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Partnership as of December 31, 2022
and 2021, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Partnership s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Partnership in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Partnership
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Partnership s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

The
critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated
or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial
statements and (ii) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does
not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters
below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Allowance
for Loan and Lease Losses 

Critical
Audit Matter Description 

As
described in Note 2 to the financial statements, the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s estimate of probable
incurred credit losses in the Partnership s loan and lease portfolio. In calculating the allowance for loan and lease losses, the
Partnership assesses historical loss experience based on loan and lease type and qualitative factor adjustments for changes not reflected
in the historical loss experience. 

The
determination of the qualitative factor adjustments involves a higher degree of management subjectivity, and includes factors such as
concentrations, delinquencies, lease or loan modifications, economic conditions, and the amount of loss in the event of default. 

The
principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses is a critical
audit matter is that significant judgment and estimation is exercised by management in determining the allowance for loan and lease losses,
which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence
obtained relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses, including the qualitative component. 

How
the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit 

Addressing
the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial
statements. These procedures included, among others, testing management s process for estimating the allowance for loan and lease
losses, including evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology and the Partnership s risk rating of each loan and lease in
its asset portfolio, testing the completeness and accuracy of certain data used in the allowance for loan and lease losses, and evaluating
the reasonableness of significant assumptions and judgments used by management to estimate the qualitative component of the allowance
for loan and lease losses including those judgments related to the impact of concentrations, economic conditions and other considerations. 

Long-Lived
Asset Impairment 

Critical
Audit Matter Description 

As
described in Note 2 to the financial statements, the impairment of long-lived assets represents management s estimate that probable
net undiscounted future cash flows are less than carrying value. 

The
principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impairment is a critical audit matter is that
significant judgment and estimation is exercised by management in determining the impairment for long-lived assets, which in turn led
to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained relating
to the long-lived asset impairment. 

How
the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit 

Addressing
the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial
statements. These procedures included, among others, testing management s process for estimating the long-lived asset impairment,
including evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology, testing the completeness and accuracy of certain data used in the long-lived
asset impairments, and evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions and judgments used by management related to the impact
of concentrations, economic conditions and other considerations.

 Notes

 For
the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 

for a interest in the Partnership s
income, losses and distributions. The Investment Manager makes all investment decisions and manages the investment portfolio of the Partnership. 

The
Partnership s income, losses and distributions are allocated to the Limited Partners and to the General Partner until the
Limited Partners have received total distributions equal to their capital contributions plus an per year, compounded annually, cumulative
return on their capital contributions. After such time, all income, losses and distributable cash will be allocated to the Limited
Partners and to the General Partner. The Partnership expects to conduct its activities for at least six years and divide the Partnership s
life into three distinct stages: (i) the Offering Period, (ii) the Operating Period and (iii) the Liquidation Period. The Offering Period
began on August 11, 2016 and concluded on March 31, 2019. The Operating Period commenced on October 3, 2016 and concluded on October
3, 2021. During the Operating Period, the Partnership invested most of the net proceeds from its offering in business-essential, revenue-producing
(or cost-saving) equipment, other physical assets with substantial economic lives and, in many cases, associated revenue streams and
project financings. The Liquidation Period, which commenced on October 4, 2021, is the period in which the Partnership will sell its
assets in the ordinary course of business and will last two years, unless it is extended, at the sole discretion of the General Partner. 

During
the Operating Period, . At December 31, 2022 and 2021 we declared and accrued a distribution of and ,
respectively, for distributions due to our General Partner which resulted in distributions payable to our General Partner of 
at December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

From
August 11, 2016 through March 31, 2019, the Partnership admitted Limited Partners with total capital contributions of 
resulting in the sale of Units. The Partnership received cash contributions of and applied which would
have otherwise been paid as sales commission to the purchase of additional Units. 

The
investment committee of the Investment Manager approves each new equipment lease, financing transaction, and lease acquisition. As part
of this process it determines the unguaranteed residual value, if any, to be used once the acquisition has been approved. The factors
considered in determining the unguaranteed residual value include, but are not limited to, the creditworthiness of the potential lessee,
the type of equipment being considered, how the equipment is integrated into the potential lessees business, the length of the
lease the industry in which the potential lessee operates and the secondary market value of the equipment. Unguaranteed residual values
are reviewed for impairment in accordance with the Partnership s policy relating to impairment review. 

The
residual value assumes, among other things, that the asset will be utilized normally in an open, unrestricted and stable market. Short-term
fluctuations in the marketplace are disregarded, and it is assumed that there is no necessity either to dispose of a significant number
of the assets, if held in quantity, simultaneously or to dispose of the asset quickly. The residual value is calculated using information
from various external sources, such as trade publications, auction data, equipment dealers, wholesalers and industry experts, as well
as inspection of the physical asset and other economic indicators. 

impairment loss for collateralized loan receivable or finance
leases for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

. At December 31, 2021, an impairment was determined to exist for other assets and an
impairment loss was recorded for . 

The
Partnership has adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Topic 740, Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. This accounting guidance prescribes recognition thresholds that must be met before a tax position
is recognized in the financial statements and provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting
in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. Additionally, an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that
meet a more likely than not threshold. The Partnership has evaluated its entity level tax positions for the years ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, and does not expect any material adjustments to be made. The tax years 2022, 2021, 2020 and 2019 remain open
to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the Partnership is subject. 

increase to the allowance and a decrease to retained
earnings, which will be reflected in the Partnership s first quarter 2023 financial statements. 

During March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Facilitation of the Effects
of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted
accounting principles GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another
reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform, if certain criteria are met. Entities may elect the optional
expedients and exceptions included in ASU 2020-04 as of March 12, 2020 and through December 31, 2022. The Partnership is currently assessing
the effect that electing the optional expedients and exceptions included in ASU 2020-04 would have on its results of operations, financial
position and cash flows. 

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect
on the financial statements. 

of all capital contributions received by the Partnership. Because organizational and offering expenses will
be paid, as and to the extent they are incurred, organizational and offering expenses may be drawn disproportionately to the gross proceeds
of each closing. The Offering Period concluded on March 31, 2019 with the Partnership receiving in total capital contributions
and as a result, organizational and offering expenses were limited to or of total equity raised. The Partnership paid the

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures 

In
connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, our General Partner carried
out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the management of our General Partner, including its Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our General Partner s disclosure controls
and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based on the foregoing evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of
our General Partner concluded that our General Partner s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022
at the reasonable assurance level. 

In
designing and evaluating our General Partner s disclosure controls and procedures, our General Partner recognized that disclosure
controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our General Partner s disclosure controls and procedures have been designed
to meet reasonable assurance standards. Disclosure controls and procedures cannot detect or prevent all error and fraud. Some inherent
limitations in disclosure controls and procedures include costs of implementation, faulty decision-making, simple error and mistake.
Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management
override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all anticipated and unanticipated
future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with established
policies or procedures. 

Our
General Partner s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have determined that no weakness in disclosure controls and
procedures had any material effect on the accuracy and completeness of our financial reporting and disclosure included in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K. 

Evaluation
of internal control over financial reporting 

Our
General Partner is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our General Partner s internal controls
system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the Partnership; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the Partnership are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Partnership; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Partnership s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate. 

Our
General Partner s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of our General Partner, conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of our General Partner s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based
on the Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Based on their assessment, our General Partner s management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, its internal
control over financial reporting was effective at the reasonable assurance level. 

Changes
in internal control over financial reporting 

There
were no additional material changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2022, that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Code
of Business Conduct and Ethics 

Because
we do not directly employ any persons, we rely on a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics adopted by our General Partner that applies to
the principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer of our General Partner, as well as to persons
performing services for us generally. You may request a copy of this code of ethics by mailing or request to our General Partner at ASIF
GP, LLC, 100 Arboretum Drive, Suite 105, Portsmouth, New Hampshire 03801. 

We
are not required to and do not have an independent audit committee or a financial expert. 

Item
11. Executive Compensation. 

We
do not pay the officers or directors of our General Partner, our Investment Manager or their affiliates any compensation. However, we
will pay our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliate s fees and reimburse certain of their expenses incurred
on our behalf. These expense reimbursements include reimbursing our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliate s
for certain costs incurred on our behalf, including the cost of personnel, other than controlling persons of our General Partner, our
Investment Manager and their affiliates, who will perform administration, accounting, investor relations, secretarial, transfer and other
services required by us. These individuals also will perform similar services for our General Partner, our Investment Manager or their
affiliates and other affiliated investment programs, including our Investment Manager s prior equipment leasing and finance programs,
as well as investment programs to be formed in the future by our General Partner and its affiliates. We entered into an agreement which
provides that expense reimbursements paid by us to our General Partner, our Investment Manager and their affiliates must be limited to
the lesser of their actual cost or the cost of comparable services from third-parties. We expect that we will allocate the cost of compensation
and benefits of our General Partner s officers, the officers and employees of our Investment Manager, and the officers and employees
of their affiliates, excluding expenses allocable to their controlling persons, based on the amount of their business time spent on our
business.
