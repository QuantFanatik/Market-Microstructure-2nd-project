In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, will, could, should, expect, plan, project, intend, anticipate, believe, seek, estimate, predict, potential, pursue, target, continue, the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company s actual future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the possibility that certain tax benefits of our net operating losses may be restricted or reduced in a change in ownership or a further change in the federal tax rate; the inability to carry out plans and strategies as expected limitations on the availability of sufficient credit or cash flow to fund our working capital needs and capital expenditures and debt service; difficulty in fulfilling the terms of our convertible note payables, which could result in a default and acceleration of our indebtedness under our convertible note payables; the possibility that we issue additional shares of common stock or convertible securities that will dilute the percentage ownership interest of existing stockholders and may dilute the book value per share of our common stock; the relatively low trading volume of our common stock, which could depress our stock price; competition in the industries in which we operate, both from third parties and former employees, which could result in the loss of one or more customers or lead to lower margins on new projects; a general reduction in the demand for our services; our ability to enter into, and the terms of, future contracts; uncertainties inherent in estimating future operating results, including revenues, operating income or cash flow; complications associated with the incorporation of new accounting, control and operating procedures; the recognition of tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions; You should understand that the foregoing, as well as other risk factors discussed in this document and in Part I Item 1A, under the heading of Risk Factors could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those experienced previously or those expressed in such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any information, including information concerning our net operating losses, borrowing availability or cash position, or any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this report. The Forward-looking Statements are provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K pursuant to the Safe Harbor established under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and should be evaluated in context of the estimates, assumptions, uncertainties, and uses described herein. 3 Table of Contents ITEM 1: BUSINESS A) General Crown Equity Holdings Inc. formerly known as Micro Bio-Medical Waste Systems, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated on August 31, 1995 as "Visioneering Corporation" under the laws of the State of Nevada. In December, 2010, the Company formed two wholly owned subsidiaries Crown Tele Services Inc. and CRWE Direct Inc. Crown Tele Services Inc. was formed to provide voice over internet services to clients at a competitive price, CRWE Direct Inc. was formed to provide direct sales to customers. In December 2011, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary CRWE Real Estate Inc. to hold real estate. This entity had no sales during the year. The company sold the above subsidiaries (Crown Tele Services Inc., CRWE Direct, and CRWE Real Estate Inc.) on the 28 th of December, 2017. At the present time, the Company is offering its services to domestic and global companies seeking to become public entities in the United States. It has launched a website, www.crownequityholdings.com, which offers its services in a wide range of fields. The Company provides various consulting services to companies and individuals dealing with corporate structure and operations globally. The Company also provides public relations and news dissemination for publicly and privately held companies. In 2009, the Company re-focused its primary vision to using its network of websites to provide advertising and marketing services, as a worldwide online media advertising publisher, dedicated to the distribution of quality branding information. The Company offers Internet media-driven advertising services, which cover and connect a wide range of marketing specialties, as well as search engine optimization for clients interested in online media awareness. As part of its operations, the Company has utilized the services of software and hardware technicians in developing its websites and adding additional websites. This allows the Company to disseminate news and press releases for its customers as well as general news and financial information on a much bigger scale than it did previously. The Company markets its services to companies seeking market awareness of them and the services or goods that they offer. The Company then publishes information concerning these companies on its many websites. The Company is paid in cash and/or stock of the customer companies. The condition of online publishing remains at an all-time high and is continuing to evolve and grow. It is to a point where online publishing is a key component of a publishing company's strategy in the print dominated market. No longer is the possession of printed reading material adding value to a reader's experience. At the moment, the majority of the Company's publishing sites have light to relatively medium traffic. The Company is presently in the process of strengthening its online publishing competitive position with its strategy of producing and obtaining a stronger presence with its community targeted online news and information publishing. The Company has increased its web presence with the dedicated community targeted news and information publishing websites. The Company has increased its readership to create a stronger competitive position within the online publishing industry. The company is continuing its efforts with increasing its readership to obtain advertisers wanting to reach its viewership. The Company's office is located at 11226 Pentland Downs Street, Las Vegas, NV 89141. The Company is provided office space by one of the officers and directors at no charge. As of December 31, 2022, the Company utilized the services of independent contractors during the year. Officers compensation is detailed in Part III, Item 11 of this filing. 4 Table of Contents ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS We have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities and can expect such losses and negative cash flows to continue in the foreseeable future. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon raising capital from financing transactions and future sales. If we are unable to adapt to changing market conditions, client requirements or emerging industry standards, our business could be adversely affected. Because of inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to change in conditions. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, if our operating results differ from our announced guidance or the expectations of equity research analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decrease significantly. ITEM 1B: UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2: PROPERTIES The Company is provided office space by one of the officers and directors at no charge. The Company believes that this office space is sufficient for its needs for the foreseeable future. ITEM 3: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS None ITEM 4: MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES None. 5 Table of Contents PART II ITEM 5: MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES The Company's common stock is currently traded on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board in the United States, having the trading symbol "CRWE" and CUSIP #22834M305.

ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW The following discussion of the financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations of the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company and related notes included therein. The Company was incorporated on August 31, 1995 as Visioneering Corporation. In 1999, the Company acquired 20/20 Web Design, Inc., a Colorado corporation wholly owned by Crown Partners, Inc. In August, 2009, Crown Partners transferred its shares of the Company to Crown Marketing Corporation ("Crown Marketing") in exchange for marketing and public relation services to be provided by Crown Marketing. 6 Table of Contents The Company continues to search for additional areas in which it can generate revenue so that the Company will become profitable but there can be no guarantee that profitability will be achieved in the near- or long-term. The Company will attempt to carry out its business plan as discussed below. The Company's business plan is to continue building its network of online publishing sites, as well as continuing to provide the consulting and services to its client on an as-needed basis. These services include general and financial management to private and public companies with an emphasis on their financial reporting and filing requirements. Such service is subject to the needs of its clients and may vary by company. The Company will attempt to carry out its business plan as described above. The Company cannot predict to what extent its lack of liquidity and capital resources will hinder its business plan prior to the consummation of a business combination. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Since inception, the Company's most significant change in liquidity or capital resources or stockholders' equity has been receipts of proceeds from offerings of its capital stock. The revenue transaction does not reflect the ability of the Company to fund itself without outside sources in the future. In the past, officers and directors of the Company have lent or advanced monies to the Company to fund operations, there are no formal agreements or arrangements for them to continue to do so. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has 2,930 in cash, 649.71 held in brokerage accounts and 0.00 of long-term debt. On December 31, 2022, the Company had negative working capital of 1,382,838, which consisted of current assets of 2,930 and current liabilities of 1,385,768. The current liabilities of the Company on December 31, 2022 are composed of accounts payable and accrued expenses of 145,630, accounts payable and accrued expenses to related party of 1,208,740, and note payable to related parties of 9,500, convertible notes payable to related parties, net of debt discount of 19,028, and current portion of long-term debt of 2,870. Cash flows used in and provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 was 89,366 compared to cash flow used of 18,693 for the same period in 2021. Cash flows provided by and used in investing activities were 67,000 and 200,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 respectively. Cash flows provided by financing activities was 20,979 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 182,580 for the same period in 2021. The financing activities in 2022 consisted mostly of proceeds from sale of stock. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had total assets of 5,437 and total liabilities of 1,385,768. Stockholders' deficit as of December 31, 2022 was 1,380,331 compared to a deficit of 673,558 on December 31, 2021. The Company will attempt to carry out its plan of business as discussed above. The Company cannot predict to what extent its lack of liquidity and capital resources will hinder its business plan. The Company will need additional capital to fund that proposed operation. NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FINANCING The Company's existing capital may not be sufficient to meet the Company's cash needs, including the costs of compliance with the continuing reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. No commitments to provide additional funds have been made by management or other stockholders. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any funds will be available to the Company to allow it to cover its expenses. The Company might seek to compensate providers of services by issuances of stock in lieu of cash. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2022 to the Year Ended December 31, 2021. 7 Table of Contents REVENUES Sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 2,936 compared to 15,660 for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of 12,725. Of the 2,936 revenue in 2022, 2,150 was from related parties. OPERATING EXPENSES During the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred 481,512 in operating expenses, compared to 513,443 in the same period ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of 31,931 mainly due to decrease in General and Administrative expenses. OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES During the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred other expenses of a negative 261,398, consisting of interest expense of 4,213, Gain (Loss) on Stocks Held of 252,568 and Other Income (Expense) of 4,617.

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Crown Equity Holdings, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern The accompanying consolidated financial states have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company suffered a net loss from operations and has a net capital deficiency, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans regarding those matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Going concern Critical Audit Matter Description As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had a going concern due to a working capital deficiency, negative cash flows from operations and limited business operations as of December 31, 2022. Auditing management s evaluation of a going concern can be a significant judgment given the fact that the Company uses management estimates on future revenues and expenses which are not able to be substantiated. How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit To evaluate the appropriateness of the going concern, we examined and evaluated the financial information that was the initial cause along with management s plans to mitigate the going concern and management s disclosure on going concern. /s/ We have served as the Company s auditor since 2018.

F-23 Table of Contents ITEM 9: CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE There were no disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure during the relevant period. ITEM 9A: CONTROLS PROCEDURES Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting We have not made any changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report on Form 10-K that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures For purposes of this section, the term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Act") (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO has concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are not effective because of the identification of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which is identified below, which we view as an integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures. 9 Table of Contents Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act that designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to change in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that there are material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses relate to the following: - Lack of segregation of duties in financial reporting, as our financial reporting and all accounting functions are performed by our Officers. Our Officers do not possess accounting expertise and our company does not have an audit committee. - Lack of a formal review process that includes multiple levels of review, as all accounting and financial reporting functions are performed by our Officers and the work is not reviewed by anyone. - Lack of expertise in accounting for and valuation of equity and marketable securities transactions. - Lack of controls over the identification and approval of related parties and transactions. These weaknesses are due to the company's lack of working capital to hire additional staff. To remedy the material weaknesses, we intend to engage another accountant to assist with financial reporting as soon as our finances will allow. This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to the attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this annual report. The Company's management carried out an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The Company's management based its evaluation on criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment, management has concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The Officers and Directors of the Company will devote most of their time to the Company; however, there will be occasions when the time requirements of the Company's business conflict with the demands of their other business and investment activities. Such conflicts may require that the Company attempt to employ additional personnel. There is no assurance that the services of such persons will be available or that they can be obtained upon terms favorable to the Company. There is no procedure in place which would allow the Officers and Directors to resolve potential conflicts in an arms-length fashion. Accordingly, they will be required to use their discretion to resolve them in a manner which they consider appropriate. 12 Table of Contents The Company's Officers and Directors may actively negotiate or otherwise consent to the purchase of a portion of their common stock as a condition to, or in connection with, a proposed merger or acquisition transaction. It is anticipated that a substantial premium over the initial cost of such shares may be paid by the purchaser in conjunction with any sale of shares by the Company's Officers and Directors which is made as a condition to, or in connection with, a proposed merger or acquisition transaction. The fact that a substantial premium may be paid to the Company's Officers and Directors to acquire their shares creates a potential conflict of interest for them in satisfying their fiduciary duties to the Company and its other shareholders. Even though such a sale could result in a substantial profit to them, they would be legally required to make the decision based upon the best interests of the Company and the Company's other shareholders, rather than their own personal pecuniary benefit. The Company previously adopted a Code of Ethics in 2004. The Company has revised the Code of Ethics and is adopting a new Code of Ethics which applies to its directors as well as to its officers including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer.
