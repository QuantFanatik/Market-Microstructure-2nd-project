Reinsurance 
 
 TLIC cedes reinsurance under various agreements allowing management to control exposure to potential losses arising from large risks and providing additional capacity for growth and risk diversification. TLIC reinsures all amounts of risk on any one life in excess of 100,000 for individual life insurance with IHLIC, Optimum Re Insurance Company Optimum Re ), RGA Reinsurance Company and Wilton Reassurance Company Wilton Re ). 
 
 The Company also assumes reinsurance under various agreements allowing management to increase growth in assets and profitability. TLIC is a party to an Automatic Retrocession Pool Agreement (the Reinsurance Pool with Optimum Re, Catholic Order of Foresters, American Home Life Insurance Company and Woodmen of the World. The agreement provides for automatic retrocession of coverage in excess of Optimum Re s retention on business ceded to Optimum Re by the other parties to the Reinsurance Pool. TLIC s maximum exposure on any one insured under the Reinsurance Pool is 100,000. As of January 1, 2008, the Reinsurance Pool stopped accepting new cessions. 
 
 Effective September 29, 2005, FLAC and Wilton Re executed a binding letter of intent whereby both parties agreed that FLAC would cede the simplified issue version of its Golden Eagle Whole Life (Final Expense) product to Wilton Re on a 50/50 quota share original term coinsurance basis. The letter of intent was executed on a retroactive basis to cover all applicable business issued by FLAC subsequent to January 1, 2005. Wilton Re agreed to provide various commission and expense allowances to FLAC in exchange for FLAC ceding 50 of the applicable premiums to Wilton Re as they were collected. As of June 24, 2006, Wilton Re terminated the reinsurance agreement for new business issued after the termination date. 
 
 FBLIC also participates in reinsurance in order to provide risk diversification, additional capacity for future growth and limit the maximum net loss potential arising from large amounts of risk. FBLIC reinsures initial amounts of risk on any one life in excess of 100,000 for individual life insurance with Optimum Re. TLIC and FBLIC also reinsure its accidental death benefit portion of their life policies under a bulk agreement with Optimum Re. To the extent that the reinsurance companies are unable to meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements, TLIC and FBLIC remain primarily liable for the entire amount at risk. 
 
 Coinsurance 
 
 Effective January 1, 2018, TLIC entered into an annuity coinsurance agreement with an offshore annuity and life insurance company whereby 90 of TLIC s annuity considerations originated after December 31, 2017 were ceded to the assuming company. The assuming company contractually reimburses TLIC for the related commissions, withdrawals, settlements, interest credited, submission costs, maintenance costs, marketing costs, excise taxes and other costs plus a placement fee. Effective April 1, 2020, the Company and an offshore annuity and life insurance company mutually agreed that the Quota Share under its existing reinsurance agreement shall be 0 for future business instead of the original contractual amount of 90 . 
 
 In accordance with this annuity coinsurance agreement, TLIC holds assets and recognizes a funds withheld liability for the benefit of the assuming company in an amount at least equal to the annuity reserves, in accordance with U.S. statutory accounting principles, generated by this ceded business. In addition, the assuming company maintains a trust related to this ceded business amounting to at least an additional 4 of assets above the annuity reserve required under U.S. statutory accounting principles. This coinsurance agreement may be terminated for new business by either party at any time upon 30 days prior written notice to the other party. 
 
 In 2019, TLIC entered into a life insurance coinsurance agreement with TAI, effective October 1, 2018, whereby 100 of TAI s life insurance policies and annuity contracts issued after September 30, 2018 were ceded to TLIC. TLIC contractually reimburses TAI for the related commissions, submission costs, maintenance costs, marketing costs and other costs related to the production of life insurance policies and annuity contracts. 
 
 In 2022, FBLIC entered into group life insurance coinsurance agreement with Texas Republic Life Insurance Company TRLIC ), whereby generally 50 of TRLIC group life insurance policies and premiums were ceded to FBLIC. FBLIC contractually reimburses TRLIC for generally 50 of the related commissions, submission costs, maintenance costs, marketing costs and other costs related to the production of group life insurance policies.

Competition 
 
 The U.S. life insurance industry is a mature industry that has experienced little to no growth. Competition is intense because the life insurance industry is consolidating, with larger, more efficient and more effective organizations emerging from consolidation. In addition, legislation became effective in the United States that permits commercial banks, insurance companies and investment banks to combine. These factors have increased competitive pressures in general. 
 
 Many domestic life insurance companies have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources, longer business histories and more diversified lines of insurance products than we do. We also face competition from companies marketing in person as well as with direct mail and internet sales campaigns. Although we may be at a competitive disadvantage to these entities, we believe that our premium rates, policy features, marketing approaches and policyholder services are generally competitive with those of other life insurance companies selling similar types of products and provide us with niche marketing opportunities not actively pursued by other life insurance companies. 
 
 Governmental Regulation 
 
 TLIC and FBLIC, respectively, are subject to regulation and supervision by the OID and the MDCI. The insurance laws of Oklahoma and Missouri give the OID and MDCI broad regulatory authority, including powers to: (i) grant and revoke licenses to transact business; (ii) regulate and supervise trade practices and market conduct; (iii) establish guaranty associations; (iv) license agents; (v) approve policy forms; (vi) approve premium rates for some lines of business; (vii) establish reserve requirements; (viii) prescribe the form and content of required financial statements and reports; (ix) determine the reasonableness and adequacy of statutory capital and surplus and (x) regulate the type and amount of permitted investments. TLIC and FBLIC can be required, under the solvency or guaranty laws of most states in which they do business, to pay assessments (up to prescribed limits) to fund policyholder losses or liabilities of other insurance companies that become insolvent. These assessments may be deferred or foregone under most guaranty laws if they would threaten an insurer s financial strength and, in certain instances, may be offset against future premium taxes. 
 
 TLIC is subject to Oklahoma laws and FBLIC is subject to Missouri laws that limit the amount of dividends insurance companies can pay to stockholders without approval of the respective Departments of Insurance. The maximum dividend, which may be paid in any twelve-month period without notification or approval, is limited to the greater of 10 of statutory surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or the net gain from operations of the preceding calendar year. Cash dividends may only be paid out of surplus derived from realized net profits. Based on these limitations, there is no capacity for TLIC to pay a dividend due to a negative unassigned surplus of 3,633,769 as of December 31, 2022. In addition, based on those limitations, there is the capacity for FBLIC to pay a dividend up to 1,237,769 in 2023 without prior approval. In 2022, FBLIC paid a 3,200,000 dividend to TLIC, of which 1,495,631 was considered ordinary and 1,704,369 was considered extraordinary. FBLIC has paid no dividends TLIC in 2021. These dividends would be eliminated in consolidation. TLIC has paid no dividends to FTFC. 
 
 There are certain factors particular to the life insurance business which may have an adverse effect on the statutory operating results of TLIC and FBLIC. One such factor is that the costs associated with issuing a new policy in force is usually greater than the first year s policy premium. Accordingly, in the early years of a new life insurance company, these initial costs and the required provisions for reserves often have an adverse effect on statutory operating results. 
 
 Employees 
 
 As of March 6, 2023, the Company had eighteen full-time employees. 
 
 Item 2. Properties 
 
 TLIC owns approximately three acres of undeveloped land located in Topeka, Kansas with a carrying value of 409,436. FBLIC owns approximately one-half acre of undeveloped land located in Jefferson City, Missouri with a carrying value of 131,000. 
 
 During 2022, the Company sold investment real estate property with an aggregate carrying value of 147,909. The Company recorded a gross realized investment gain on sale of 52,171 based on an aggregate sales price of 200,080. 

9

During 2021, the Company foreclosed on residential mortgage loans of real estate totaling 458,587 and transferred those properties to investment real estate held for sale. During 2021, the Company sold investment real estate property with an aggregate carrying value of 528,178. The Company recorded a gross realized investment gain on sale of 289,840 based on an aggregate sales price of 818,018. 
 
 Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, we are a party to various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. While management is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, it believes that any ultimate liability arising from them will not have a material effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flow. We are not currently a party to any bankruptcy, receivership, reorganization, adjustment or similar proceeding, and we are not aware of any material threatened litigation. As summarized below, the Company is currently involved in three pending lawsuits. 
 
 A lawsuit filed by the Company and its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gregg E. Zahn Mr. Zahn styled First Trinity Financial Corporation and Gregg E. Zahn vs. C. Wayne Pettigrew and Group Pension Planners was originally filed in 2013 in the District Court of Tulsa County, Oklahoma against former Company Board of Director, C. Wayne Pettigrew Mr. Pettigrew ). The Company and Mr. Zahn alleged that Mr. Pettigrew defamed Mr. Zahn and the Company and that Mr. Pettigrew breached his fiduciary duties to the Company by making untrue statements about the Company and Mr. Zahn to the press, state regulators and to certain shareholders. 
 
 In February 2017, the lawsuit resulted in a jury verdict in favor of the Company and Mr. Zahn, with the jury awarding damages of 800,000 to the Company and 3,500,000 to Mr. Zahn. In February 2020, the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals, upon an appeal by Mr. Pettigrew, reversed the judgment and remanded the case for a new trial. A Petition for Certiorari review with the Oklahoma Supreme Court by the Company and Mr. Zahn was declined in December, 2020. The case is now scheduled to be retried in the District Court. The Company is vigorously prosecuting this case. The Company faces no exposure in connection with this action since there were no counterclaims or cross claims made against the Company. Management believes that this lawsuit is not material in relation to the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
 
 The Company, through its life insurance subsidiary, TLIC, commenced two lawsuits as plaintiff, both in the New York Supreme Court, New York County, one on June 29, 2020 and another on March 4, 2022, for breach of contract against a company for failure to advance funding to lottery ticket winners to the detriment of TLIC and against various of that company s associated persons for unjust enrichment and fraud perpetuated on TLIC. The cases are entitled Trinity Life Insurance Company v. Advance Funding LLC, Dan Cevallos, and Monica L. Ray, Index No. 652780/2020 (New York Supreme Court, New York County) and Trinity Life Insurance Company v. Advance Funding LLC, Dan Cevallos, Julie Casal, and Monica L. Ray, Index No. 651023/2022 (New York Supreme Court, New York County). The Company is vigorously prosecuting this case against the defendants. The Company faces no exposure in connection with either action since no counterclaims or cross claims have been made against the Company. Management believes that this lawsuit is not material in relation to the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
 
 The third lawsuit involves an insurance holding company and one of its insurance subsidiaries, which was instituted suit in District Court of Travis County, Texas, entitled Citizens, Inc., CICA Life Ltd., and CICA Life Insurance Company of America, Plaintiffs, v. Randall H. Riley, Citizens American Life, LLC, Citizens American Life, Inc., Alexis Enrique Delgado, Carlos Nalsen Landa, Enrique Pinzon Ruiz, Johan Emilio Mikuski Silva, Esperanza Peralta De Delgado, Michael P. Buchweitz, Jonathan M. Pollio, Steven A. Rekedal, First Trinity Financial Corporation, Trinity American, Inc., and International Marketing Group S.A., LLC, Defendants, against the Company and several associated persons on November 7, 2018. The plaintiffs accused the several defendants, including the Company and its subsidiary company, Trinity American, Inc. Trinity American of misappropriating trade secrets under the Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act. The plaintiffs have also alleged claims for common law unfair competition, civil conspiracy, and unjust enrichment against all of the defendants. The plaintiffs also alleged that Trinity American s predecessor entity tortiously interfered with the plaintiffs contracts, and alleged several other causes of action, including breaches of contract and tortious interference with contract against the remaining defendants. 

10

The causes of action all are alleged to have arisen from the alleged conduct of the various individual defendants, three of whom are former employees of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs alleged that defendant Randall H. Riley and other terminated employees, after being terminated by the plaintiffs, worked on creating a competing business selling whole life insurance in international markets. Several of the individual defendants have counterclaimed against the plaintiffs seeking damages for breach of contract based on commissions they were denied when the plaintiffs wrongfully terminated their sales agreements. Mr. Riley died in October 2022. Trial of the case has been delayed indefinitely pending action from the Travis County Probate Court with respect to the estate of Mr. Riley. The Company believes the plaintiffs claims against the Company are entirely without merit and it is conducting a vigorous defense. Management believes that the ultimate resolution of this lawsuit will not be material in relation to the Company s financial position or results of operations.

 PART II 
 
 Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Small Business Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

(a) 
 Market Information 

Trading of the Company s common stock is limited and an established public market does not exist. 

(b) 
 Holders 

As of March 6, 2023, there were approximately 7,800 shareholders of the Company s outstanding common stock. 
 
 On October 2, 2019, at the Company Annual Shareholders Meeting, FTFC s shareholders approved the following proposals: 

An amendment and restatement of FTFC s Certificate of Incorporation to authorize 40,000,000 shares of Class A common stock and 10,000,000 shares of Class B common stock and to establish the relative rights, preferences and privileges of, and the restrictions and limitations on, the Class A common stock and the Class B common stock. 

An amendment and restatement of FTFC s Certificate of Incorporation to automatically reclassify each issued and outstanding share of our existing common stock as one (1) share of Class A common stock or, at the shareholder s election, into one (1) share of new Class B common stock. 

These proposals received Form A regulatory approval from the OID on February 27, 2020 and the MDCI on December 31, 2019, followed by formal adoption by FTFC s Board of Directors on March 12, 2020. Effective March 12, 2020, FTFC s Class B shareholders were entitled to elect a majority of FTFC s Board of Directors (one-half plus one) but will only receive, compared to FTFC s Class A shareholders, 85 of cash dividends, stock dividends or amounts due upon any FTFC merger, sale or liquidation event. FTFC s Class B shareholders may also convert one share of FTFC s Class B common stock for a .85 share of FTFC s Class A common stock. FTFC s Class A shareholders will elect the remaining Board of Directors members and will receive 100 of cash dividends, stock dividends or amounts due upon any Company merger, sale or liquidation event. 

(c) 
 Dividends 

Prior to 2020, we had never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. In 2020, our Board of Directors declared and paid a 0.05 per share cash dividends on our Class A common stock. 
 
 The timing, declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our operating results, earnings, financial condition, the capital requi rements of our business and other factors. 

11

Although a cash dividend of 0.05 per share or 393,178 was paid to our Class A shareholders in 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company has not adopted a dividend payment policy; however, dividends must necessarily depend upon the Company s earnings and financial condition, applicable legal restrictions, and other factors relevant at the time the Board of Directors considers the declaration of a cash dividend. Cash available for dividends to shareholders of the Company must initially come from income and capital gains earned on its investment portfolio and dividends paid by the Company s subsidiaries. 
 
 Provisions of the Oklahoma Insurance Code relating to insurance holding companies subject transactions between the Company and TLIC and the Company and FBLIC, including dividend payments, to certain standards generally intended to prevent such transactions from adversely affecting the adequacy of life insurance subsidiaries capital and surplus available to support policyholder obligations. In addition, under the Oklahoma General Corporation Act, the Company may not pay dividends if, after giving effect to a dividend, it would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or if its total liabilities would exceed its total assets. 
 
 On January 10, 2011, the Company s Board of Directors approved a 5 share dividend by which shareholders received a share of common stock for each 20 shares of common stock of the Company they hold. The dividend was payable to the holders of shares of the Corporation as of March 10, 2011. Fractional shares were rounded to the nearest whole number of shares. The Company issued 323,777 shares in connection with the stock dividend. 
 
 On January 11, 2012, the Company s Board of Directors approved another 5 share dividend by which shareholders received a share of common stock for each 20 shares of common stock of the Company they hold. The dividend was payable to the holders of shares of the Corporation as of March 10, 2012. Fractional shares were rounded to the nearest whole number of shares. The Company issued 378,908 shares in connection with the stock dividend. 
 
 On November 12, 2020, the Company s Board of Directors approved a 10 share dividend by which shareholders received a share of Class A common stock for each 10 shares of Class A common stock of the Company they hold. The dividend was payable to the holders of shares of the Corporation as of November 12, 2020. Fractional shares were rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares. The Company issued 791,339 shares in connection with the stock dividend.

(f) 
 Purchases of Equity Securities by Issuer 

During 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, the Company repurchased 247,580 shares of its common stock at a total cost of 893,947 from former members of the Board of Directors including the former Chairman of the Board of Directors, a former agent, the former spouse of the Company s current Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President and a charitable organization where a former member of the Board of Directors had donated shares of the Company s common stock. 
 
 Item 6. Reserved 
 
 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Overview 
 
 First Trinity Financial Corporation we us , our , FTFC or the Company conducts operations as an insurance holding company emphasizing ordinary life insurance products and annuity contracts in niche markets. 

12

As an insurance provider, we collect premiums in the current period to pay future benefits to our policy and contract holders. Our core TLIC and FBLIC operations include issuing modified premium whole life insurance with a flexible premium deferred annuity, ordinary whole life, final expense, term and annuity products to predominately middle income households in the states of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and West Virginia through independent agents. 
 
 We also realize revenues from our investment portfolio, which is a key component of our operations. The revenues we collect as premiums from policyholders are invested to ensure future benefit payments under the policy contracts. Life insurance companies earn profits on the investment spread, which reflects the investment income earned on the premiums paid to the insurer between the time of receipt and the time benefits are paid out under policies. Changes in interest rates, changes in economic conditions and volatility in the capital markets can all impact the amount of earnings that we realize from our investment portfolio. 
 
 Our profitability in the life insurance and annuity segments is a function of our ability to accurately price the policies that we write, adequately value life insurance business acquired, administer life insurance company acquisitions at an expense level that validates the acquisition cost and invest the premiums and annuity considerations in assets that earn investment income with a positive spread. 
 
 Acquisitions 
 
 The Company expects to facilitate growth through acquisitions of other life insurance companies and/or blocks of life insurance and annuity business. In late December 2008, the Company completed its acquisition of 100 of the outstanding stock of FLAC for 2,500,000 and had additional acquisition related expenses of 195,234. 
 
 In late December 2011, the Company completed its acquisition of 100 of the outstanding stock of FBLIC for 13,855,129. 
 
 On April 28, 2015, the Company acquired a block of life insurance policies and annuity contracts according to the terms of an assumption reinsurance agreement and assumed liabilities of 3,055,916. 
 
 In 2019, FTFC s acquisition of TAI for 250,000 was approved by the Barbados, West Indies regulators. 
 
 Effective January 1, 2020, the Company acquired 100 of the outstanding common stock of K-TENN Insurance Company K-TENN from its sole shareholder in exchange for 168,866 shares of FTFC s common stock. The aggregate purchase price of K-TENN was 1,746,240. 
 
 On January 4, 2022, FTFC acquired RCLIC from Royalty in exchange for 722,644 shares of FTFC s Class A common stock issued to unrelated parties. Royalty was dissolved immediately after FTFC acquired RCLIC. On March 1, 2022, the Missouri Department of Commerce and Insurance approved FTFC s contribution and merger of RCLIC into FBLIC. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity and capital resources is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP ). Preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions continually, including those related to investments, deferred acquisition costs, value of insurance business acquired and policy liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following accounting policies, judgments and estimates are the most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 

13

Investments in Fixed Maturity Securities 
 
 We hold fixed maturity interests in a variety of companies. We continuously evaluate all of our fixed maturity investments based on current economic conditions, credit loss experience and other developments. We evaluate the difference between the amortized cost and estimated fair value of our fixed maturity investments to determine whether any decline in fair value is other-than-temporary in nature. This determination involves a degree of uncertainty. If a decline in the fair value of a fixed maturity security is determined to be temporary, the decline is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders equity. If a decline in a security s fair value is considered to be other-than-temporary, we then determine the proper treatment for the other-than-temporary impairment. 
 
 For fixed maturity securities, the amount of any other-than-temporary impairment related to a credit loss is recognized in earnings and reflected as a reduction in the cost basis of the security. The amount of any other-than-temporary impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) with no change to the cost basis of the security. 
 
 The assessment of whether a decline in fair value is considered temporary or other-than-temporary includes management s judgment as to the financial position and future prospects of the entity issuing the security. It is not possible to accurately predict when it may be determined that a specific security will become impaired. Future adverse changes in market conditions, poor operating results of underlying fixed maturity investments and defaults on interest and principal payments could result in losses or an inability to recover the current carrying value of the fixed maturity investments, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. 
 
 In addition, if a change occurs in our intent to sell temporarily impaired fixed maturity securities prior to maturity or recovery in value, or if it becomes more likely than not that we will be required to sell such securities prior to recovery in value or maturity, a future impairment charge could result. If an other-than-temporary impairment related to a credit loss occurs with respect to a fixed maturity security, we amortize the reduced book value back to the security s expected recovery value over the remaining term of the fixed maturity investment. We continue to review the fixed maturity security for further impairment that would prompt another write-down in the book value. 
 
 Mortgage Loans on Real Estate 
 
 We carry mortgage loans on real estate at unpaid balances, net of unamortized premium or discounts. Interest income and the amortization of premiums or discounts are included in net investment income. Mortgage loan fees, certain direct loan origination costs and purchase premiums and discounts on loans are recognized as an adjustment of yield by the interest method based on the contractual terms of the loan. In certain circumstances, prepayments may be anticipated. We have established a valuation allowance for mortgage loans on real estate that are not supported by funds held in escrow. 
 
 This allowance for possible loan losses from investments in mortgage loans on real estate is a reserve established through a provision for possible loan losses charged to expense which represents, in our judgment, the known and inherent credit losses existing in the residential and commercial mortgage loan portfolio. This allowance, in our judgment, is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses inherent in the residential and commercial mortgage loan portfolio and reduces the carrying value of investments in mortgage loans on real estate to the estimated net realizable value on the consolidated statement of financial position. 
 
 While we utilize our best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of this allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of the residential and commercial mortgage loan portfolio, the economy and changes in interest rates. Our allowance for possible mortgage loan losses consists of specific valuation allowances established for probable losses on specific loans and a portfolio reserve for probable incurred but not specifically identified loans. 
 
 We consider mortgage loans on real estate impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the mortgage loan agreement. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis. Factors that we consider in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value of the real estate subject to the mortgage loan and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Mortgage loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. 

14

We determine the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the mortgage loan on real estate and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. 
 
 Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs 
 
 Commissions and other acquisition costs which vary with and are primarily related to the successful production of new and renewal insurance contracts are deferred and amortized in a systematic manner based on the related contract revenues or gross profits as appropriate. The recovery of deferred acquisition costs is dependent on the future profitability of the underlying business for which acquisition costs were incurred. Each reporting period, we evaluate the recoverability of the unamortized balance of deferred acquisition costs. We consider estimated future gross profits or future premiums; expected mortality or morbidity; interest earned and credited rates; persistency and expenses in determining whether the balance is recoverable. 
 
 If we determine a portion of the unamortized balance is not recoverable, it is immediately charged to amortization expense. The assumptions we use to amortize and evaluate the recoverability of the deferred acquisition costs involve significant judgment. A revision to these assumptions may impact future financial results. Deferred acquisition costs related to the successful production of new and renewal insurance business for traditional life insurance contracts are deferred to the extent deemed recoverable and amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing future policy benefit liabilities. 
 
 Deferred acquisition costs related to the successful production of new and renewal insurance and annuity products that subject us to mortality or morbidity risk over a period that extends beyond the period or periods in which premiums are collected and that have terms that are fixed and guaranteed (i.e., limited-payment long-duration annuity contracts) are deferred to the extent deemed recoverable and amortized in relation to the present value of actual and expected gross profits on the policies. To the extent that realized gains and losses on securities result in adjustments to deferred acquisition costs related to insurance and annuity products, such adjustments are reflected as a component of the amortization of deferred acquisition costs. 
 
 Deferred acquisition costs related to limited-payment long-duration insurance and annuity contracts are also adjusted, net of tax, for the change in amortization that would have been recorded if the unrealized gains (losses) from securities had actually been realized. This adjustment is included in the change in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on available-for-sale securities, a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the shareholders equity section of the statement of financial position. 
 
 Value of Insurance Business Acquired 
 
 As a result of our purchases of FLAC and FBLIC, an asset was recorded in the application of purchase accounting to recognize the value of acquired insurance in force. The Company s value of acquired insurance in force is an intangible asset with a definite life and is amortized under FASB guidance. The value of acquired insurance in force is amortized primarily over the emerging profit of the related policies using the same assumptions that were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits. The recovery of the value of insurance business acquired is dependent on the future profitability of the underlying business that was initially recorded in the purchases of FLAC and FBLIC. Each reporting period, we evaluate the recoverability of the unamortized balance of the value of insurance business acquired. 
 
 For the amortization of the value of acquired insurance in force, the Company reviews its estimates of gross profits each reporting period. The most significant assumptions involved in the estimation of gross profits include interest rate spreads; future financial market performance; business surrender and lapse rates; mortality and morbidity; expenses and the impact of realized investment gains and losses. In the event actual experience differs significantly from assumptions or assumptions are significantly revised, the Company is required to record a charge or credit to amortization expense for the period in which an adjustment is made. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there was 4,691,773 and 4,421,379, respectively, of accumulated amortization of the value of insurance business acquired due to the purchases of FLAC and FBLIC. The Company expects to amortize the value of insurance business acquired by the following amounts over the next five years:, 257,470 in 2023, 215,134 in 2024, 202,009 in 2025, 176,859 in 2026 and 170,026 in 2027.

Future Policy Benefits 
 
 Our liability for future policy benefits is primarily comprised of the present value of estimated future payments to or on behalf of policyholders, where the timing and amount of payment depends on policyholder mortality or morbidity, less the present value of future net premiums. For life insurance and annuity products, expected mortality and morbidity is generally based on the Company s historical experience or standard industry tables including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation. 
 
 Interest rate assumptions are based on factors such as market conditions and expected investment returns. Although mortality and morbidity and interest rate assumptions are locked-in upon the issuance of new insurance with fixed and guaranteed terms, significant changes in experience or assumptions may require the Company to provide for expected future losses on a product by establishing premium deficiency reserves. 
 
 Estimating liabilities for our long-duration insurance contracts requires management to make various assumptions, including policyholder persistency, mortality rates, investment yields, discretionary benefit increases, new business pricing and operating expense levels. 
 
 Since many of these factors are interdependent and subject to short-term volatility during the long-duration contract period, substantial judgment is required. Actual experience may emerge differently from that originally estimated. Any such difference would be recognized in the current year s consolidated statement of operations. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 Financial Instruments Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 
 
 In June 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance (Accounting Standards Update 2016-13) for the accounting for credit losses for financial instruments. The updated guidance applies a new credit loss model (current expected credit losses or CECL) for determining credit-related impairments for financial instruments measured at amortized cost (e.g. reinsurance recoverables, including structured settlements that are recorded as part of reinsurance recoverables) and requires an entity to estimate the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure or pool of exposures. The estimate of expected credit losses should consider historical information, current information, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts, including estimates of prepayments. 
 
 The expected credit losses, and subsequent adjustments to such losses, will be recorded through an allowance account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, with the net carrying value of the financial asset presented on the consolidated balance sheet at the amount expected to be collected. The updated guidance also amends the current other-than-temporary impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities by requiring the recognition of impairments relating to credit losses through an allowance account and limits the amount of credit loss to the difference between a security s amortized cost basis and its fair value. In addition, the length of time a security has been in an unrealized loss position will no longer impact the determination of whether a credit loss exists. 
 
 The updated guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. As a Smaller Reporting Company, the effective date was recently changed and the delayed effective date is now for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. 
 
 Early adoption is permitted for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Based on the financial instruments currently held by the Company, there would not be a material effect on the Company s results of operations, financial position or liquidity if the new guidance had been adopted in the current accounting period. The impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position or liquidity at the date of adoption of the updated guidance will be determined by the financial instruments held by the Company and the economic conditions at that time. 

16

Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts 
 
 In August 2018, the FASB issued updated guidance (Accounting Standards Update 2018-12) to the existing recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements for long-duration contracts issued by an insurance entity. This update improves the timeliness of recognizing changes in the liability for future policy benefits, modifies the rate used to discount future cash flows, simplifies and improves accounting for certain market-based options or guarantees associated with deposit (i.e., account balance) contracts, simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisitions costs and expands required disclosures. The expanded disclosure requires an insurance entity to provide disaggregated roll forwards of beginning to ending balances of the following: liability for future policy benefits, policyholder account balances, market risk benefits, separate account liabilities and deferred acquisition costs including disclosure about, changes to and effect of changes for significant inputs, judgments, assumptions and methods used in measurements. 
 
 The updated guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020. As a Smaller Reporting Company, the effective date has been changed twice and the delayed effective date is now for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted but not likely to be elected by the Company. With respect to the liability for future policyholder benefits for traditional and limited-payment contracts and deferred acquisition costs, an insurance entity may elect to apply the amendments retrospectively as of the beginning of the earliest period presented. 
 
 With respect to the market risk benefits, an insurance entity should apply the amendments retrospectively as of the beginning of the earliest period presented. The Company expects that the impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position and liquidity at the date of adoption of the updated guidance in 2025 will be determined by the long-duration contracts then held by the Company and the economic conditions at that time. 
 
 Income Taxes Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes 
 
 In December 2019, the FASB issued updated guidance (Accounting Standards Update 2019-12) for the accounting for income taxes. The updated guidance is intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing several exceptions contained in existing guidance and amending other existing guidance to simplify several other income tax accounting matters. The Company adopted this guidance in first quarter 2021. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 
 
 Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures 
 
 In March 2022, the FASB issued amendments (Accounting Standards Update 2022-2) for the accounting of troubled debt restructuring and disclosures. The amendments introduce new requirements related to certain modifications of receivables made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. The amendments promulgate that an entity must apply specific loan refinancing and restructuring guidance to determine whether a modification results in a new loan or the continuation of an existing loan. The amendments also require that an entity disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investment in leases. The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods and should be applied prospectively. The adoption of this guidance should not have a material effect on the Company s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 
 
 Transition for Sold Contracts 
 
 In December 2022, the FASB issued amendments (Accounting Standards Update 2022-5) to Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 (Targeted Improvements for Long-Duration Contracts) that originally required an insurance entity to apply a retrospective transition method as of the beginning of the earliest period presented or the beginning of the prior fiscal year if early application was elected. This updated guidance reduces implementation costs and complexity associated with the adoption of targeted improvements in accounting for long-duration contracts that have been derecognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 before the delayed effective date. 

17

Without the amendments in this Update, an insurance entity would be required to reclassify a portion of gains or losses previously recognized in the sale or disposal of insurance contacts or legal entities because of the adoption of a new accounting standard. Because there is no effect on an insurance entity s future cash flows, this reclassification may not be useful to users of financial information. The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted but not likely to be elected by the Company. The Company expects that the impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position and liquidity at the date of adoption of the updated guidance in 2025 will be determined by the long-duration contracts then held by the Company and the economic conditions at that time.

31,922,288 

3,783,272 

The 3,783,272 increase in premiums for the year ended December 31, 2022 is primarily due to a 3,483,105 increase in final expense renewal premiums, 1,020,267 increase in ordinary life renewal premiums, 872,895 increase in ordinary life first year premiums that exceeded a 1,592,995 decrease in final expense first year premiums. 
 
 The increase in final expense renewal premiums reflects the persistency of prior years final expense production. The increase in ordinary life renewal premiums and ordinary life first year premiums primarily reflects ordinary dollar denominated life insurance policies sold in the international market by TAI. The decrease in final expense first year premiums reflects tightening of underwriting guidelines. 
 
 Service Fees 
 
 The 2,775,727 increase in service fees for the year ended December 31, 2022 is primarily due to brokering mortgage loans for a fee to third parties.

The 4,145,494 increase in total benefits, claims and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 is discussed below. 
 
 Benefits and Claims 
 
 The 3,817,174 increase in total benefits and claims for the year ended December 31, 2022 is primarily due to the following: 

1,943,823 increase in death benefits is primarily due to approximately 1,700,000 of increased final expense benefits and 244,000 of increased ordinary life benefits. 

1,591,540 increase in future policy benefits is primarily due to the increased number of life policies in force and the aging of existing life policies. 

216,259 increase in surrenders is based upon policyholder election on life insurance policies. 

Deferral and Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs 
 
 Certain costs related to the successful acquisition of traditional life insurance policies are capitalized and amortized over the premium-paying period of the policies. Certain costs related to the successful acquisition of insurance and annuity policies that subject us to mortality or morbidity risk over a period that extends beyond the period or periods in which premiums are collected and that have terms that are fixed and guaranteed (i.e., limited-payment long-duration annuity contracts) are capitalized and amortized in relation to the present value of actual and expected gross profits on the policies. 

22

These acquisition costs, which are referred to as deferred policy acquisition costs, include commissions and other successful costs of acquiring policies and contracts, which vary with, and are primarily related to, the successful production of new and renewal insurance and annuity contracts. 
 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, capitalized costs were 13,734,859 and 12,102,070, respectively. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 7,280,457 and 6,932,504. 
 
 The 1,632,789 increase in the 2022 acquisition costs deferred primarily relates to increased ordinary life first year and annuity production and deferral of increased eligible commissions and expenses.

The 6,288,892 decrease in deferred federal income taxes was due to 7,316,376 of decreased deferred federal income taxes on the unrealized appreciation of fixed maturity securities available-for-sale and 1,027,484 of operating deferred federal tax expense. 
 
 The 14,285,594 decrease in funds withheld under coinsurance agreement is due to a decrease in annuity surrenders on ceded business related to TLIC s annuity coinsurance agreement with an offshore annuity and life insurance company. 
 
 The 159,905 increase in policy claims is due to an increase in the number of final expense claims.

The 9,270,592 increase in suspense accounts payable is due to increased annuity deposits on policy applications that had not been issued as of the financial reporting date. 
 
 The decrease in mortgage loan suspense of 4,878,089 is primarily due to timing of principal loan payments on mortgage loans. 
 
 There was a 660,000 increase in the guaranty fund assessments from increased insolvency of life insurance companies. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 390,508 in security purchases where the trade date and settlement date were in different financial reporting periods compared to 1,465,173 of security purchases overlapping financial reporting periods as of December 31, 2021. 
 
 The increase in unclaimed funds of 178,577 is due to increased outstanding checks that will be escheated to the states. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our operations have been financed primarily through the private placement of equity securities and intrastate public stock offerings. Through December 31, 2022, we have received 27,119,480 from the sale of our shares and recorded 1,746,240 from the exchange of our shares to acquire K-TENN in 2020. 
 
 The Company raised 1,450,000 from two private placements during 2004 and 25,669,480 from two public stock offerings and one private placement stock offering from June 22, 2005 through February 23, 2007; June 29, 2010 through April 30, 2012; and August 15, 2012 through March 8, 2013. The Company issued 7,347,488 shares of its common stock and incurred 3,624,518 of offering costs during these private placements and public stock offerings. 
 
 The Company also issued 702,685 shares of its common stock in connection with two stock dividends paid to shareholders in 2011 and 2012 that resulted in accumulated earnings being charged 5,270,138 with an offsetting credit of 5,270,138 to common stock and additional paid-in capital. 
 
 In 2020, the Company paid a 0.05 per share cash dividend for a total of 393,178 and issued 791,339 shares of class A common stock in connection with a 10 stock dividend to its Class A shareholders. The 10 stock dividend resulted in accumulated earnings being charged 8,657,249 with an offsetting credit of 8,657,249 to common stock and additional paid-in capital. 

30

During 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, the Company repurchased 247,580 shares of its common stock at a total cost of 893,947 from former members of the Board of Directors including the former Chairman of the Board of Directors, a former agent, the former spouse of the Company s current Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President and a charitable organization where a former member of the Board of Directors had donated shares of the Company s common stock. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 33,542,725. As of December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents of 14,642,786 and 13,038,325, respectively, totaling 27,681,111 were held by TLIC and FBLIC and may not be available for use by FTFC due to the required pre-approval by the OID and MDCI of any dividend or intercompany transaction to transfer funds to FTFC. The maximum dividend, which may be paid in any twelve-month period without notification or approval, is limited to the greater of 10 of statutory surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or the net gain from operations of the preceding calendar year. 
 
 Cash dividends may only be paid out of surplus derived from realized net profits. Based on these limitations, there is no capacity for TLIC to pay a dividend due to a negative unassigned surplus of 3,633,769 as of December 31, 2022. In addition, based on those limitations, there is the capacity for FBLIC to pay a dividend up to 1,237,769 in 2023 without prior approval. In 2022, FBLIC paid a 3,200,000 dividend to TLIC, of which 1,495,631 was considered ordinary and 1,704,369 was considered extraordinary. Dividends paid by FBLIC to TLIC are eliminated in consolidation. TLIC has paid no dividends to FTFC. In 2022, TLIC returned 2,200,000 in capital to FTFC. This return of capital by TLIC to FTFC is eliminated in consolidation. 
 
 The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents at multiple institutions. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures interest and non-interest bearing accounts up to 250,000. Uninsured balances aggregate 32,933,850 and 40,431,952 as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Other funds are invested in mutual funds that invest in U.S. government securities. We monitor the solvency of all financial institutions in which we have funds to minimize the exposure for loss. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. 
 
 On September 15, 2022, the Company did not renew its 1.5 million line of credit with a bank to provide working capital and funds for expansion. For the one-year period ending September 15, 2022, the Company s line of credit with a bank allowed for advances, repayments and re-borrowings. Any outstanding advances would have incurred interest at a variable interest rate of the prime rate set forth in the Wall Street Journal plus 1 per annum adjusting monthly based on a 360-day year with a minimum interest rate floor of 5.75 . The non-utilized portion of the 1.5 million line of credit would have been assessed a 1 non-usage fee calculated in arrears and paid at the maturity date. No amounts were outstanding on this line of credit during the years it was available.

(16,742,039) 

The decrease in shareholders equity of 16,742,039 for the year ended December 31, 2022 is due to a 27,523,506 decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) that exceeded net income of 6,184,703 and an increase in additional paid-in capital and Class A common stock of 4,596,764 related to the acquisition of RCLIC. 
 
 The liquidity requirements of our life insurance companies are met primarily by funds provided from operations. Premium and annuity consideration deposits, investment income and investment maturities are the primary sources of funds, while investment purchases, policy benefits, and operating expenses are the primary uses of funds. There were no liquidity issues in 2022 or 2021. Our investments include marketable debt securities that could be readily converted to cash for liquidity needs. We are subject to various market risks. The quality of our investment portfolio and the current level of shareholders equity continue to provide a sound financial base as we strive to expand our marketing to offer competitive products. 

32

Our investment portfolio had unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on available-for-sale securities of 18,131,268) and 16,720,674 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, prior to the impact of income taxes and deferred acquisition cost adjustments. A decrease of 33,990,160 in unrealized gains arising for year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 net realized investment gains of 861,782 originating from the sale, calls and maturities for fixed maturity securities available-for-sale resulting in net unrealized losses on investments of 34,851,942. 
 
 A primary liquidity concern is the risk of an extraordinary level of early policyholder withdrawals. We include provisions within our insurance policies, such as surrender charges, that help limit and discourage early withdrawals. Individual life insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may incur surrender charges and undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy. Cash flow projections and cash flow tests under various market interest rate scenarios are also performed annually to assist in evaluating liquidity needs and adequacy. We currently anticipate that available liquidity sources and future cash flows will be adequate to meet our needs for funds. 
 
 One of our significant risks relates to the fluctuations in interest rates. Regarding interest rates, the value of our available-for-sale fixed maturity securities investment portfolio will increase or decrease in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income earned on newly acquired available-for-sale fixed maturity securities increases or decreases in direct relationship with interest rate changes. 
 
 From an income perspective, we are exposed to rising interest rates which could be a significant risk, as TLIC s and FBLIC s annuity business is impacted by changes in interest rates. Life insurance company policy liabilities bear fixed rates. From a liquidity perspective, our fixed rate policy liabilities are relatively insensitive to interest rate fluctuations. We believe gradual increases in interest rates do not present a significant liquidity exposure for the life insurance policies and annuity contracts. We maintain conservative durations in our fixed maturity portfolio. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, the fair value of fixed maturity available-for-sale securities with maturities of less than one year and the fair value of lottery receivables with maturities of less than one year equaled 10.2 of total policy liabilities. If interest rates rise significantly in a short time frame, there can be no assurance that the life insurance industry, including the Company, would not experience increased levels of surrenders and reduced sales, and thereby be materially adversely affected. 
 
 In addition to the measures described above, TLIC and FBLIC must comply with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners promulgated Standard Valuation Law SVL which specifies minimum reserve levels and prescribes methods for determining them, with the intent of enhancing solvency. Upon meeting certain tests, which TLIC and FBLIC met during 2022, the SVL also requires the Company to perform annual cash flow testing for TLIC and FBLIC. This testing is designed to ensure that statutory reserve levels will maintain adequate protection in a variety of potential interest rate scenarios. The Actuarial Standards Board of the American Academy of Actuaries also requires cash flow testing as a basis for the actuarial opinion on the adequacy of the reserves which is a required part of the annual statutory reporting process. 
 
 Our marketing plan could be modified to emphasize certain product types and reduce others. New business levels could be varied in order to find the optimum level. We believe that our current liquidity, current bond portfolio maturity distribution and cash position give us substantial resources to administer our existing business and fund growth generated by direct sales. 
 
 The operations of TLIC and FBLIC may require additional capital contributions to meet statutory capital and surplus requirements mandated by state insurance departments. Life insurance contract liabilities are generally long term in nature and are generally paid from future cash flows or existing assets and reserves. We will service other expenses and commitments by: (1) using available cash, (2) dividends from TLIC and FBLIC that are limited by law to the greater of prior year net operating income or 10 of prior year end surplus unless specifically approved by the controlling insurance department, (3) public and private offerings of our common stock and (4) corporate borrowings, if necessary. 
 
 Effective January 1, 2019, the Company entered into a revised advance agreement with one loan originator. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has outstanding advances to this loan originator totaling 4,743,041. The advances are secured by 9,016,158 of residential mortgage loans on real estate that are assigned to the Company. The Company has committed to fund up to an additional 1,756,959 to the loan originator that would result in additional security in the form of residential mortgage loans on real estate to be assigned to the Company. 

33

Effective January 1, 2019, the Company also entered into a revised escrow agreement with the same loan originator. According to the revised terms of the escrow agreement, as of December 31, 2022, 753,648 of additional and secured residential mortgage loan balances on real estate are held in escrow by the loan originator. As of December 31, 2022, 656,924 of that escrow amount is available to the Company as additional collateral on 4,743,041 of advances to the loan originator. The remaining December 31, 2022 escrow amount of 96,724 is available to the Company as additional collateral on its investment of 19,344,898 in mortgage loans on real estate. 
 
 We are not aware of any commitments or unusual events that could materially affect our capital resources. We are not aware of any current recommendations by any regulatory authority which, if implemented, would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources or operations. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

 We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of First Trinity Financial Corporation and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 
 Amortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs Refer to Notes 1 and 6 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 The Company s products include traditional life insurance contracts and annuities in which certain acquisition costs are capitalized and the expenses are deferred into future periods. Management amortizes the capitalized costs of traditional life insurance products over the premium paying period of the products based on assumptions developed and consistent with assumptions used in determining the products future policy benefit liabilities. Amortization of annuity products and certain limited payment life insurance products are amortized based on actual and expected future gross profits. The unamortized deferred policy acquisition cost asset was 56.2 million as of December 31, 2022. 

37

The recovery of the unamortized deferred policy acquisition cost asset is dependent on the future profitability of the related products. Management periodically reviews the recoverability by developing an actuarial study of the present value of future profits of the products, and reduces the asset when the asset is shown to not be recoverable. 
 
 As a result, the audit of this area requires a high degree of judgment due to the complex nature of determining the amortization for the period and creation of actuarial studies for recoverability. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the amortization of the unamortized deferred policy acquisition cost asset and consideration of the recoverability of the asset included, among others, the following: 
 
 We gained an understanding of the processes utilized and controls implemented in amortizing the deferred policy acquisition 
 
 We obtained previous actuarial recoverability studies, and any current updates to the studies 
 
 We tested data utilized by management for completeness and accuracy 
 
 We engaged an independent actuarial specialist to assist with the review and evaluation of the assumptions and methodologies used by management for the study of recoverability 

Future Policy Benefits Refer to Note 1 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 Liabilities for amounts payable under the Company s life insurance products are recorded as future policy benefits liabilities. Such liabilities are established based on actuarial assumptions at the time policies are issued. Management applies considerable judgement in developing the actuarial assumptions based on expectations of future economic conditions and policyholder behavior. These assumptions are developed at the time the contracts are issued, or in the case of a business combination, at the time the contracts are purchased. If actual experience is adverse in nature when compared to the original assumptions in developing the future policy benefits liability, management may be required to establish premium deficiency reserves. The Company s future policy benefits liability was 110.0 million as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 The audit of future policy benefits requires a high degree of auditor judgment when considering the complex actuarial assumptions and models management utilizes. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the liability for future policy benefits included the following procedures, among others: 
 
 We gained an understanding of the processes utilized and controls implemented in determining the valuation of future policy benefits 
 
 We tested the underlying data used by management in developing the valuation and the completeness and accuracy of the data 
 
 We obtained original assumption information and subsequent experience studies 
 
 We engaged an independent actuarial specialist to evaluate the actuarial assumptions and methodologies for reasonableness, to develop an independent estimate of future policy benefits on a sample basis and to evaluate management s development of experience studies.

Likewise, if a change occurs in the Company s intent to sell temporarily impaired securities prior to maturity or recovery in value, or if it becomes more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell such securities prior to recovery in value or maturity, a future impairment charge could result. 
 
 If an other-than-temporary impairment related to a credit loss occurs with respect to a bond, the Company amortizes the reduced book value back to the security's expected recovery value over the remaining term of the bond. The Company continues to review the security for further impairment that would prompt another write-down in the value. 
 
 Equity securities are comprised of mutual funds and common stocks and are carried at fair value. The associated unrealized gains and losses are included in net realized investment gains (losses). Dividends from these investments are recognized in net investment income when declared. 
 
 Mortgage loans are carried at unpaid balances, net of unamortized premium or discounts. Interest income and the amortization of premiums or discounts are included in net investment income. Mortgage loan fees, certain direct loan origination costs, and purchase premiums and discounts on loans are recognized as an adjustment of yield by the interest method based on the contractual terms of the loan. In certain circumstances, prepayments may be anticipated. The Company has established a valuation allowance for mortgage loans on real estate that are not supported by funds held in escrow. 
 
 Investment real estate in land held for both the production of income and for sale is carried at cost. Investment real estate obtained through foreclosure on mortgage loans on real estate is carried at the lower of acquisition cost or net realizable value.

Deferred acquisition costs for the successful production of traditional life insurance contracts are deferred to the extent deemed recoverable and amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing future policy benefit liabilities. Deferred acquisition costs related to the successful production of insurance and annuity products that subject the Company to mortality or morbidity risk over a period that extends beyond the period or periods in which premiums are collected and that have terms that are fixed and guaranteed (i.e., limited-payment long-duration annuity contracts) are deferred to the extent deemed recoverable and amortized in relation to the present value of actual and expected gross profits on the policies. 
 
 To the extent that realized gains and losses on fixed income securities result in adjustments to deferred acquisition costs related to insurance and annuity products, such adjustments are reflected as a component of the amortization of deferred acquisition costs. Deferred acquisition costs related to limited-payment long-duration insurance and annuity contracts are also adjusted, net of tax, for the change in amortization that would have been recorded if the unrealized gains (losses) from available-for-sale securities had actually been realized. This adjustment is included in the change in net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on available-for-sale securities, a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the shareholders equity section of the statement of financial position.

Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts 
 
 In August 2018, the FASB issued updated guidance (Accounting Standards Update 2018 - 12 to the existing recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements for long-duration contracts issued by an insurance entity. This update improves the timeliness of recognizing changes in the liability for future policy benefits, modifies the rate used to discount future cash flows, simplifies and improves accounting for certain market-based options or guarantees associated with deposit (i.e., account balance) contracts, simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisitions costs and expands required disclosures. The expanded disclosure requires an insurance entity to provide disaggregated roll forwards of beginning to ending balances of the following: liability for future policy benefits, policyholder account balances, market risk benefits, separate account liabilities and deferred acquisition costs including disclosure about, changes to and effect of changes for significant inputs, judgments, assumptions and methods used in measurements. 
 
 The updated guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020. As a Smaller Reporting Company, the effective date has been changed twice and the delayed effective date is now for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted but not likely to be elected by the Company. With respect to the liability for future policyholder benefits for traditional and limited-payment contracts and deferred acquisition costs, an insurance entity may elect to apply the amendments retrospectively as of the beginning of the earliest period presented. 
 
 With respect to the market risk benefits, an insurance entity should apply the amendments retrospectively as of the beginning of the earliest period presented. The Company expects that the impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position and liquidity at the date of adoption of the updated guidance in 2025 will be determined by the long-duration contracts then held by the Company and the economic conditions at that time. 
 
 Income Taxes - Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes 
 
 In December 2019, the FASB issued updated guidance (Accounting Standards Update 2019 - 12 for the accounting for income taxes. The updated guidance is intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing several exceptions contained in existing guidance and amending other existing guidance to simplify several other income tax accounting matters. The Company adopted this guidance in first quarter 2021. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 
 
 Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures 
 
 In March 2022, the FASB issued amendments (Accounting Standards Update 2022 - 2 for the accounting of troubled debt restructuring and disclosures. The amendments introduce new requirements related to certain modifications of receivables made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. The amendments promulgate that an entity must apply specific loan refinancing and restructuring guidance to determine whether a modification results in a new loan or the continuation of an existing loan. The amendments also require that an entity disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investment in leases. The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods and should be applied prospectively. The adoption of this guidance should not have a material effect on the Company s results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 

Transition for Sold Contracts 
 
 In December 2022, the FASB issued amendments (Accounting Standards Update 2022 - 5 to Accounting Standards Update 2018 - 12 (Targeted Improvements for Long-Duration Contracts) that originally required an insurance entity to apply a retrospective transition method as of the beginning of the earliest period presented or the beginning of the prior fiscal year if early application was elected. This updated guidance reduces implementation costs and complexity associated with the adoption of targeted improvements in accounting for long-duration contracts that have been derecognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Update 2018 - 12 before the delayed effective date. Without the amendments in this Update, an insurance entity would be required to reclassify a portion of gains or losses previously recognized in the sale or disposal of insurance contracts or legal entities because of the adoption of a new accounting standard. Because there is no effect on an insurance entity s future cash flows, this reclassification may not be useful to users of financial information. 
 
 The amendments in this guidance are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted but not likely to be elected by the Company. The Company expects that the impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position and liquidity at the date of adoption of the updated guidance in 2025 will be determined by the long-duration contracts then held by the Company and the economic conditions at that time.

 The Company s decision to record an impairment loss is primarily based on whether the security s fair value is likely to remain significantly below its book value based on all of the factors considered. Factors that are considered include the length of time the security s fair value has been below its carrying amount, the severity of the decline in value, the credit worthiness of the issuer, and the coupon and/or dividend payment history of the issuer. The Company also assesses whether it intends to sell or whether it is more likely than not that it may be required to sell the security prior to its recovery in value. 
 
 For any fixed maturity securities that are other-than-temporarily impaired, the Company determines the portion of the other-than-temporary impairment that is credit-related and the portion that is related to other factors. The credit-related portion is the difference between the expected future cash flows and the amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity security, and that difference is charged to earnings. The non-credit-related portion representing the remaining difference to fair value is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). Only in the case of a credit-related impairment where management has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis, is a fixed maturity security adjusted to fair value and the resulting losses recognized in realized gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations. Any other-than-temporary impairments on equity securities are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in the periods incurred as the difference between fair value and cost. 
 
 There were no impairment losses recognized by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 Management believes that the Company will fully recover its cost basis in the securities held as of December 31, 2022, and management does not have the intent to sell nor is it more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell such securities until they recover or mature. The remaining temporary impairments shown herein are primarily the result of the current interest rate environment rather than credit factors that would imply other-than-temporary impairment.

As of December 31, 2022, Level 3 financial instruments consisted of a private placement common stock that has no active trading and a joint venture investment with a mortgage loan originator. 
 
 This private placement common stock represents an investment in a small insurance holding company. The fair value for this security was determined through the use of unobservable assumptions about market participants. The Company has assumed a willing market participant would purchase the security for the same price as the Company paid until such time as this small insurance holding company commences significant operations. The joint venture investment with a mortgage loan originator is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. 
 
 Fair values for Level 1 and Level 2 assets for the Company s fixed maturity available-for-sale securities and equity securities are primarily based on prices supplied by a third party investment service. The third party investment service provides quoted prices in the market which use observable inputs in developing such rates. 
 
 The Company analyzes market valuations received to verify reasonableness and to understand the key assumptions used and the sources. Since the fixed maturity securities owned by the Company do not trade on a daily basis, the third party investment service prepares estimates of fair value measurements using relevant market data, benchmark curves, sector groupings and matrix pricing. As the fair value estimates of the Company s fixed maturity securities are based on observable market information rather than market quotes, the estimates of fair value on these fixed maturity securities are included in Level 2 of the hierarchy. The Company s Level 2 investments include obligations of U.S. government, U.S. government agencies, state and political subdivisions, commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, exchange traded securities, foreign bonds, redeemable preferred securities and certificate of deposit. 
 
 The Company s equity securities are included in Level 1 and Level 2 and the private placement common stocks and joint venture investment are included in Level 3. Level 1 for the equity securities classified as such is appropriate since they trade on a daily basis, are based on quoted market prices in active markets and are based upon unadjusted prices. Level 2 for those equity securities classified as such is appropriate since they are not actively traded. 
 
 The Company s fixed maturity available-for-sale securities and equity securities are highly liquid and allows for a high percentage of the portfolio to be priced through pricing services. 
 
 The change in the fair value of the Company s Level 3 equity securities available-for-sale for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is summarized as follows:

The estimated fair value amounts have been determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment was required to interpret market data to develop these estimates. Accordingly, the estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts which could be realized in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the fair value amounts. 
 
 The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating the fair value disclosures for financial instruments in the accompanying financial statements and notes thereto: 
 
 Fixed Maturity Securities and Equity Securities 
 
 The fair value of fixed maturity securities and equity securities are based on the principles previously discussed as Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. 
 
 Mortgage Loans on Real Estate 
 
 The fair values for mortgage loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses. For both residential and commercial mortgage loans, the discount rate used was indexed to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate and LIBOR yield curve as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents, Short-Term Investments, Accrued Investment Income and Policy Loans 
 
 The carrying value of these financial instruments approximates their fair values. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are included in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy due to their highly liquid nature. 
 
 Other Long-Term Investments 
 
 Other long-term investments are comprised of lottery prize receivables and fair value is derived by using a discounted cash flow approach. Projected cash flows are discounted using the average FTSE Pension Liability Index in effect at the end of each period. 
 
 Investment Contracts Policyholders Account Balances 
 
 The fair value for liabilities under investment-type insurance contracts (accumulation annuities) is calculated using a discounted cash flow approach. Cash flows are projected using actuarial assumptions and discounted to the valuation date using risk-free rates adjusted for credit risk and the nonperformance risk of the liabilities. 
 
 The fair values for insurance contracts other than investment-type contracts are not required to be disclosed. 
 
 Policy Claims 
 
 The carrying amounts reported for these liabilities approximate their fair value.

A Petition for Certiorari review with the Oklahoma Supreme Court by the Company and Mr. Zahn was declined in December, 2020. The case is now scheduled to be retried in the District Court. The Company is vigorously prosecuting this case. The Company faces no exposure in connection with this action since there were no counterclaims or cross claims made against the Company. Management believes that this lawsuit is not material in relation to the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
 
 The Company, through its life insurance subsidiary, TLIC, commenced two lawsuits as plaintiff, both in the New York Supreme Court, New York County, one on June 29, 2020 and another on March 4, 2022, for breach of contract against a company for failure to advance funding to lottery ticket winners to the detriment of TLIC and against various of that company s associated persons for unjust enrichment and fraud perpetuated on TLIC. The cases are entitled Trinity Life Insurance Company v. Advance Funding LLC, Dan Cevallos, and Monica L. Ray, Index No. 652780/2020 (New York Supreme Court, New York County) and Trinity Life Insurance Company v. Advance Funding LLC, Dan Cevallos, Julie Casal, and Monica L. Ray, Index No. 651023/2022 (New York Supreme Court, New York County). The Company is vigorously prosecuting this case against the defendants. The Company faces no exposure in connection with either action since no counterclaims or cross claims have been made against the Company. Management believes that this lawsuit is not material in relation to the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
 
 The third lawsuit involves an insurance holding company and one of its insurance subsidiaries, which was instituted suit in District Court of Travis County, Texas, entitled Citizens, Inc., CICA Life Ltd., and CICA Life Insurance Company of America, Plaintiffs, v. Randall H. Riley, Citizens American Life, LLC, Citizens American Life, Inc., Alexis Enrique Delgado, Carlos Nalsen Landa, Enrique Pinzon Ruiz, Johan Emilio Mikuski Silva, Esperanza Peralta De Delgado, Michael P. Buchweitz, Jonathan M. Pollio, Steven A. Rekedal, First Trinity Financial Corporation, Trinity American, Inc., and International Marketing Group S.A., LLC, Defendants, against the Company and several associated persons on November 7, 2018. The plaintiffs accused the several defendants, including the Company and its subsidiary company, Trinity American, Inc. Trinity American of misappropriating trade secrets under the Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act. The plaintiffs have also alleged claims for common law unfair competition, civil conspiracy, and unjust enrichment against all of the defendants. The plaintiffs also alleged that Trinity American s predecessor entity tortiously interfered with the plaintiffs contracts, and alleged several other causes of action, including breaches of contract and tortious interference with contract against the remaining defendants. 

The causes of action all are alleged to have arisen from the alleged conduct of the various individual defendants, three of whom are former employees of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs alleged that defendant Randall H. Riley and other terminated employees, after being terminated by the plaintiffs, worked on creating a competing business selling whole life insurance in international markets. Several of the individual defendants have counterclaimed against the plaintiffs seeking damages for breach of contract based on commissions they were denied when the plaintiffs wrongfully terminated their sales agreements. Mr. Riley died in October 2022. Trial of the case has been delayed indefinitely pending action from the Travis County Probate Court with respect to the estate of Mr. Riley. The Company believes the plaintiffs claims against the Company are entirely without merit and it is conducting a vigorous defense. Management believes that the ultimate resolution of this lawsuit will not be material in relation to the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
 
 Guaranty fund assessments, brought about by the insolvency of life and health insurers, are levied at the discretion of the various state guaranty fund associations to cover association obligations. In most states, guaranty fund assessments may be taken as a credit against premium taxes, typically over a five -year period.

 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Certifying Officers ), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended Exchange Act as of the end of the fiscal period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K Annual Report ). Based upon such evaluation, the Certifying Officers have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is made known to management, including our Certifying Officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure and that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. 
 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operating, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 
 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Certifying Officers, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s internal controls over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. The standard measures adopted by management in making its evaluation are the measures in the Internal-Control Integrated Framework (2013) published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based upon such evaluation, management has determined that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to the attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management s report in this Annual Report. 
 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 The Company s management, including the Certifying Officers, does not expect that the disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. 
 
 Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management or board override of the control.

December 31, 2022 and 2021

The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 
 Changes to Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
 
 Executive Compensation 
 
 The Compensation Committee assists the Board of Directors in overseeing the management of the Company s compensation and benefits program, chief executive officer performance and executive development and succession efforts. In addition, the Compensation Committee oversees the evaluation of management and compensation of the officers of the Company. 
 
 The primary objective of our compensation program is to offer executive officers competitive compensation packages that will permit the Company to attract and retain individuals with superior abilities and to motivate and reward these individuals in an appropriate manner in the long-term interest of the Company and its shareholders. Management provides recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding most compensation matters, including executive compensation; however, the Compensation Committee does not delegate any of its functions to others in setting compensation. The Company does not currently engage any consultant related to executive compensation. 
 
 The Company s compensation program for executive officers consists of base salary, consideration for annual bonuses, 401(k) plan and life, health and dental insurance coverage. These elements are intended to provide an overall compensation package that is commensurate with the Company s financial resources, that is appropriate to assure the retention of experienced management personnel and that aligns their financial interest with those of our shareholders. 
 
 Base Salary: Salary levels recommended by the Compensation Committee are intended to be competitive with salary levels of similarly situated companies, commensurate with the executive officers' respective duties and responsibilities, and reflect the financial performance of the Company. Annual salary increases are considered based on the same criteria. 
 
 Cash Bonuses: Bonus amounts are based on individual performance and are intended to reward superior performance. The Compensation Committee may also take into account additional considerations that it deems appropriate. Bonuses are discretionary and there is no formal bonus plan in place except for Gregg E. Zahn s asset and net profit bonus discussed below.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CD A) 
 
 The following Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD A") describes the material elements of compensation for executive officers identified in the Summary Compensation Table. 
 
 Compensation Philosophy 
 
 The Compensation Committee, composed of four outside directors, is responsible for implementing our compensation philosophy for directors, executive officers and employees. Our goal is to ensure we employ qualified, experienced executive officers whose financial interests are aligned with that of our shareholders. 
 
 Because we do believe a systematic pattern exists between executive compensation and performance, our compensation philosophy is structured to "motivate" managerial behaviors through a combination of base and incentive compensation. Another of our objectives is to acquire and retain people of integrity who take pride in delivering positive results. The final objective, due to our philosophy to outsource many functions and retain a low number of full-time and part-time employees, requires us to have executive officers that are able to perform and have an intimate knowledge of a combination of executive, actuarial, accounting, operating and other understandings inherent in supervising and growing a successful life insurance company. 
 
 Overview of Compensation Program 
 
 Our compensation consists of salary, bonuses, allowances and benefit plans generally administered equally for all qualified Company employees. The Compensation Committee establishes a salary for each senior executive based on long-term corporate objectives, competitive industry practices and each executive officer's contributions. The Compensation Committee seeks to ensure executive compensation is reasonable, fair and competitive. In order to make this determination, after the end of each calendar year and when financial results for the year are finalized and affirmed by the issuance of an unqualified opinion by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, the Compensation Committee generally evaluates the Company's performance and then conducts a similar exercise with respect to a group of comparable companies. 
 
 "Say-on-Pay" and "Say-When-on-Pay" 
 
 We believe our compensation philosophy and structure is fair for our executive officers. Shareholders will not find complex compensation formulas to evaluate and approve. However, to retain our limited number of corporate executives, we generally allow a minimum of one year to a maximum of 2.99 years of compensation in the event of termination of employment by the Company not for cause or for good reason. 
 
 Our straightforward and simplified approach to executive compensation insulates our shareholders from the types of corporate excesses which led to the enactment of "Say-on-Pay" and "Say-When-on Pay." We believe our compensation solution favorably serves our shareholders on matters of executive pay.

Compensation Performance Analysis 
 
 Our executive management team is led by Gregg E. Zahn and Jeffrey J. Wood who are full-time employees. The Compensation Committee conducted a review of the performance of Gregg E. Zahn and Jeffrey J. Wood for the year 2022. This review included an evaluation of the progress made towards the attainment of our corporate objectives and the role these individuals played in meeting those objectives. The review also included a broad-based comparison of salaries with senior executives of other publicly traded life insurance companies. 
 
 Due to being a smaller public reporting company and that our Class A common stock is not publicly traded, it is difficult to find public life insurance companies that are comparable to us. With the growth of our life insurance business, achieving investment opportunities with attractive yields and pursuing acquisition and growth opportunities, the Company achieved increased assets of 6,105,103 from 659,758,934 (grossed up by reinsurance and coinsurance amounting to 106,210,246) as of December 31, 2021 to 665,864,037 (grossed up by reinsurance and coinsurance amounting to 92,033,769) as of December 31, 2022 and decreased shareholders equity of 16,742,039 from 68,394,551(grossed up by accumulated other comprehensive income of 13,203,827) as of December 31, 2021 to 51,652,512(decreased by accumulated other comprehensive loss of 14,319,679)) as of December 31, 2022. The Company also achieved increased revenues of 8,442,858 from 57,116,241 in 2021 to 65,559,099 in 2022 and increased net income of 3,327,333 from 2,857,370 in 2021 to 6,184,703 in 2022. 
 
 The Company's performance in 2022 reflected the business philosophy and leadership primarily of Gregg E. Zahn supported by Jeffrey J. Wood. Giving consideration to these factors, the Compensation Committee was encouraged by executive management's demonstrated leadership. The Compensation Committee considers Gregg E. Zahn and Jeffrey J. Wood to be valuable executive officers in implementing our corporate objectives. 
 
 Gregg E. Zahn continues to lead the Company in accordance with the ideals and philosophies of acquisition of companies, organic growth of the life insurance and annuity business and pursuit of secure, attractive yielding investment returns coupled with the ultimate goal of either establishing a publicly traded stock or inclusion by an already established company with attractive liquidity settlements for FTFC s shareholders. 
 
 Jeffrey J. Wood reports to Gregg E. Zahn and leads the daily financial and related operations of the Company in accordance with those same ideals and philosophies. 
 
 In 2022, Gregg E. Zahn and Jeffrey J. Wood met the subjective expectations of our Board of Directors and shareholders. 
 
 The Compensation Committee remains cautious about its responsibility to shareholders in setting executive compensation and has asked executive management to focus on continued asset growth and profitability. Gregg E. Zahn received a 6.00 increase in base salary to 537,254 in 2022, received a 142,869 bonus in 2022 representing 5.00 of FTFC s U.S. GAAP net income of 2,857,370 and also received an automobile allowance of 24,000. Jeffrey J. Wood received a 3.00 increase in base salary to 304,484 in 2022 and received a bonus of 25,000 in 2022. 
 
 Compensation Comparable Companies 
 
 To assist in evaluating the compensation for 2022 and establishing compensation for future years, the Compensation Committee utilized independent sources to identify "comparable" companies within the life insurance industry. We believe a comparable is a point of reference for measurement, but not the determinative factor for our executives' compensation. Because the comparative compensation information is one of several analytic tools used in setting executive compensation, the Compensation Committee has discretion in determining the manner and extent of its use. 
 
 Six comparables were selected for discussion of salaries and bonuses. Four of these comparable companies were: Atlantic American Life and Health, Midwest Holding, Inc., U.S. Alliance Corporation and Texas Republic Capital Corporation. These four comparable companies have different operating activities and product mixes compared to FTFC but there is insufficient public information available on compensations for life insurance companies closer to our size.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2022 and 2021

We also analyzed the results of two other companies: Citizens, Inc. and Securities National Financial Corporation. These two companies are larger than us in size, but we are familiar with their operations and executives due to third party administrative services arrangements, prior employment history and participation in reinsurance agreements and national life insurance and mortgage loan associations. Data obtained on each comparable company included executive salaries (including bonuses and all forms of current and deferred compensation), fees paid to independent members of Board of Directors, total assets, liabilities, shareholders equity, revenues, benefits and expenses, taxes and net income. 
 
 Compensation data found on these comparable companies was limited to only those individuals for whom compensation information was disclosed publicly and for the most recent public information that was only through 2021 since 2022 information is not yet publicly available. As a result, the data typically included only the most highly compensated officers at each company as of their latest public filing. Generally, this correlated to the Chairman/CEO, President and the individuals who are chief level officers (Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Investment Officer) or the equivalent with us. 
 
 Comparative Compensation Analysis 
 
 The overall results of the study of comparable companies provided additional information for the Compensation Committee to consider. As noted above, the Compensation Committee reviewed a number of factors within the comparable companies; however, with the focus on base salary compensation. 
 
 Based on the Compensation Committee's analysis, the recommended 2022 base salary compensation for Gregg E. Zahn, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jeffrey J. Wood, our Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer, was determined to be low by the Compensation Committee, especially with the many roles that they perform for our Company. These amounts are within the low range of the base compensation and total compensation for the comparable companies but some of those companies have had little or no success in producing profitable results. 
 
 In analyzing these factors, the Compensation Committee concluded that 537,254 is a low base salary compensation for our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and 304,484 is also a low base salary compensation for our Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer. The Compensation Committee believes, however, that through the use of appropriate bonuses and other incentives, these compensation shortages can be managed most efficiently and effectively using Company asset growth and profitability as measurement standards with additional consideration for the many roles that these officers fulfill for the Company. 
 
 Board Process and Conclusion 
 
 The Board of Directors discussed the Compensation Committee's recommended 2022 compensation and adopted the recommendations as proposed. The Compensation Committee of the Company has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management and, based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement, which the Board of Directors approved.
