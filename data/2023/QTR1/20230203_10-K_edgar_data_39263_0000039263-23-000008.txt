 The Corporation 
 Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc., a Texas business corporation incorporated in 1977, is a financial holding company and a bank holding company headquartered in San Antonio, Texas that provides, through its subsidiaries, a broad array of products and services throughout numerous Texas markets. The terms Cullen/Frost, the Corporation, we, us and our mean Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. and its subsidiaries, when appropriate. We offer commercial and consumer banking services, as well as trust and investment management, insurance, brokerage, mutual funds, leasing, treasury management, capital markets advisory and item processing services. At December 31, 2022, Cullen/Frost had consolidated total assets of 52.9 billion and was one of the largest independent bank holding companies headquartered in the State of Texas. 
 Our philosophy is to grow and prosper, building long-term relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards, and safe, sound assets. We operate as a locally-oriented, community-based financial services organization, augmented by experienced, centralized support in select critical areas. Our local market orientation is reflected in our regional management and regional advisory boards, which are comprised of local business persons, professionals and other community representatives that assist our regional management in responding to local banking needs. Despite this local market, community-based focus, we offer many of the products available at much larger money-center financial institutions. 
 We serve a wide variety of industries including, among others, energy, manufacturing, services, construction, retail, telecommunications, healthcare, military and transportation. Our customer base is similarly diverse. While our loan portfolio has a concentration of energy-related loans totaling approximately 5.4 of total loans at December 31, 2022, we are not dependent upon any single industry or customer. 
 Our operating objectives include expansion, diversification within our markets, growth of our fee-based income, and growth internally and through acquisitions of financial institutions, branches and financial services businesses. While we are currently focused on organic growth, we may seek merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale and expanded services. From time to time, we evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Our ability to engage in certain merger or acquisition transactions, whether or not any regulatory approval is required, will be dependent upon our bank regulators views at the time as to the capital levels, quality of management and our overall condition and their assessment of a variety of other factors. Certain merger or acquisition transactions, including those involving the acquisition of a depository institution or the assumption of the deposits of any depository institution, require formal approval from various bank regulatory authorities, which will be subject to a variety of factors and considerations. 
 Although Cullen/Frost is a corporate entity, legally separate and distinct from its affiliates, bank holding companies such as Cullen/Frost are required to act as a source of financial strength for their subsidiary banks. The principal source of Cullen/Frost s income is dividends from its subsidiaries. There are certain regulatory restrictions on the extent to which these subsidiaries can pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to Cullen/Frost. See the section captioned Supervision and Regulation elsewhere in this item for further discussion of these matters. 
 Cullen/Frost s executive offices are located at 111 W. Houston Street, San Antonio, Texas 78205, and its telephone number is (210) 220-4011.

 Supervision and Regulation 
 Cullen/Frost, Frost Bank and most of its non-banking subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws. The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders and creditors. 
 Significant elements of the laws and regulations applicable to Cullen/Frost and its subsidiaries are described below. The description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations and policies that are described. Also, such statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to Cullen/Frost and its subsidiaries could have a material effect on our business, financial condition or our results of operations. 
 Regulatory Agencies 
 Cullen/Frost is a legal entity separate and distinct from Frost Bank and its other subsidiaries. As a financial holding company and a bank holding company, Cullen/Frost is regulated under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended BHC Act ), and it and its subsidiaries are subject to inspection, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. The BHC Act provides generally for umbrella regulation of financial holding companies such as Cullen/Frost by the Federal Reserve Board, and for functional regulation of banking activities by bank regulators, securities activities by securities regulators, and insurance activities by insurance regulators. Cullen/Frost is also under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as administered by the SEC. Cullen/Frost s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE under the trading symbol CFR and our Depositary Shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of our 4.450 Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, is listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol CFR PrB. Accordingly, Cullen/Frost is also subject to the rules of the NYSE for listed companies. 
 Frost Bank is a Texas state chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System. Accordingly, the Texas Department of Banking and the Federal Reserve Board are the primary regulators of Frost Bank. Deposits at Frost Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC up to applicable limits. 
 All member banks of the Federal Reserve System, including Frost Bank, are required to hold stock in the Federal Reserve System's Reserve Banks in an amount equal to six percent of their capital stock and surplus (half paid to acquire the stock with the remainder held as a cash reserve). Member banks do not have any control over the Federal Reserve System as a result of owning the stock and the stock cannot be sold or traded. The annual dividend rate for larger member banks, including Frost Bank, is tied to 10-year U.S. Treasuries with the maximum dividend rate capped at six percent. The total amount of stock dividends that Frost Bank received from the Federal Reserve totaled 1.2 million in 2022, 532 thousand in 2021 and 313 thousand in 2020. 
 Most of our non-bank subsidiaries also are subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board and other federal and state agencies. Frost Brokerage Services, Inc. is regulated by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA and state securities regulators. Frost Investment Advisors, LLC and Frost Investment Services, LLC are subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, as administered by the SEC. Our insurance subsidiary is subject to regulation by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies. Other non-bank subsidiaries are subject to both federal and state laws and regulations. Frost Bank and its affiliates are also subject to supervision, regulation, examination and enforcement by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB with respect to consumer protection laws and regulations. 
 Bank Holding Company Activities 
 In general, the BHC Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. In addition, bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be financial holding companies may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity, that is either (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the Federal Reserve Board in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury) or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally (as solely determined by the Federal Reserve Board), without prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Activities that are

 financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments. 
 To maintain financial holding company status, a financial holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be well capitalized and well managed. A depository institution subsidiary is considered to be well capitalized if it satisfies the requirements for this status discussed in the section captioned Prompt Corrective Action, elsewhere in this item. A depository institution subsidiary is considered well managed if it received a composite rating and management rating of at least satisfactory in its most recent examination. A financial holding company s status will also depend upon it maintaining its status as well capitalized and well managed under applicable Federal Reserve Board regulations. If a financial holding company ceases to meet these capital and management requirements, the Federal Reserve Board s regulations provide that the financial holding company must enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve Board to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. Until the financial holding company returns to compliance, the Federal Reserve Board may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities, and the company may not commence any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the Federal Reserve Board may require divestiture of the holding company s depository institutions. Bank holding companies and banks must also be both well capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state. 
 In order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the BHC Act or to acquire a company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least satisfactory in its most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act. See the section captioned Community Reinvestment Act elsewhere in this item. 
 The Federal Reserve Board has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve Board has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company. 
 The BHC Act, the Bank Merger Act, the Texas Banking Code and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of commercial banks and their parent holding companies. The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board for the direct or indirect acquisition by a bank holding company of more than 5.0 of the voting shares of a commercial bank or its parent holding company. Under the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board or other appropriate bank regulatory authority is required for a member bank to merge with another bank or purchase substantially all of the assets or assume any deposits of another bank. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the bank regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the applicant's managerial and financial resources, the capital position of the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system (e.g., systemic risk), the applicant s performance record under the Community Reinvestment Act (see the section captioned Community Reinvestment Act elsewhere in this item) and its compliance with law, including fair lending, fair housing and other consumer protection laws, and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities. 
 Dividends and Stock Repurchases 
 The principal source of Cullen/Frost s liquidity is dividends from Frost Bank. The prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board is required if the total of all dividends declared by a state-chartered member bank in any calendar year would exceed the sum of the bank s net profits for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock. Federal law also prohibits a state-chartered, member bank from paying dividends that would be greater than the bank s undivided profits. Frost Bank is also subject to limitations under Texas state law regarding the level of dividends that may be paid. Under the foregoing dividend restrictions, and while maintaining its well capitalized status, Frost Bank could pay aggregate dividends of approximately 813.6 million to Cullen/Frost, without obtaining affirmative governmental approvals, at December 31, 2022. This amount is not necessarily indicative of amounts that may be paid or available to be paid in future periods.

Table of Contents 

 In addition, Cullen/Frost and Frost Bank are subject to other regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The appropriate federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank holding company or a bank that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. Additionally, it is Federal Reserve policy that bank holding companies generally should pay dividends on common stock only out of net income available to common shareholders over the past year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization's current and expected future capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Federal Reserve policy also provides that a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the bank holding company's capital structure. 
 In July 2019, the federal bank regulators adopted final rules (the Capital Simplifications Rules that, among other things, eliminated the standalone prior approval requirement in the Basel III Capital Rules for any repurchase of common stock. In certain circumstances, Cullen/Frost s repurchases of its common stock may be subject to a prior approval or notice requirement under other regulations, policies or supervisory expectations of the Federal Reserve Board. Any redemption or repurchase of preferred stock or subordinated debt remains subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. 
 In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA was enacted. Among other things, the IRA imposes a new 1 excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased after December 31, 2022 by publicly traded U.S. corporations. With certain exceptions, the value of stock repurchased is determined net of stock issued in the year, including shares issued pursuant to compensatory arrangements. 
 Transactions with Affiliates 
 Transactions between Frost Bank and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Cullen/Frost or any other subsidiary, on the other hand, are regulated under federal banking law. The Federal Reserve Act imposes quantitative and qualitative requirements and collateral requirements on covered transactions by Frost Bank with, or for the benefit of, its affiliates, and generally requires those transactions to be on terms at least as favorable to Frost Bank as if the transaction were conducted with an unaffiliated third party. Covered transactions are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the Federal Reserve Board) from the affiliate, certain derivative transactions that create a credit exposure to an affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. In general, any such transaction by Frost Bank or its subsidiaries must be limited to certain thresholds on an individual and aggregate basis and, for credit transactions with any affiliate, must be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral. 
 Federal law also limits a bank s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10 stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. Also, the terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of non-repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons individually and in the aggregate. 
 Source of Strength Doctrine 
 Federal Reserve Board policy and federal law require bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. Under this requirement, Cullen/Frost is expected to commit resources to support Frost Bank, including at times when Cullen/Frost may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding company s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.

 Capital Requirements 
 Cullen/Frost and Frost Bank are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards adopted by the Federal Reserve Board (the Basel III Capital Rules ). The Basel III Capital Rules require Cullen/Frost and Frost Bank to maintain the following: 
 A minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5 , plus a 2.5 capital conservation buffer that is composed entirely of CET1 capital (resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of 7.0 ); 
 A minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0 , plus the capital conservation buffer (resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5 ); 
 A minimum ratio of total capital (Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0 , plus the capital conservation buffer (resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5 ); and 
 A minimum leverage ratio of 4.0 , calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the leverage ratio ). 
 Banking institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios once the capital conservation buffer is taken into account, as detailed above, will be subject to constraints on capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, and certain discretionary executive compensation. The severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution s eligible retained income (that is, the greater of (i) net income for the preceding four quarters, net of distributions and associated tax effects not reflected in net income and (ii) average net income over the preceding four quarters). 
 The Basel III Capital Rules and the Capital Simplification Rules also provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that certain deferred tax assets and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 25 of CET1. Prior to the adoption of the Capital Simplification Rules in July 2019, amounts were deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeded 10 of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceeded 15 of CET1. The Capital Simplification Rules took effect for Cullen/Frost and Frost Bank as of January 1, 2020. These limitations did not impact our regulatory capital during any of the reported periods. 
 In addition, under the general risk-based capital rules, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income items included in capital were excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive income items are not excluded; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations, including Cullen/Frost and Frost Bank, were able to make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. Both Cullen/Frost and Frost Bank made this election in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of their available-for-sale securities portfolio. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, trust preferred securities no longer included in our Tier 1 capital may nonetheless be included as a component of Tier 2 capital on a permanent basis without phase-out. 
 In February 2019, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule (the 2019 CECL Rule that revised certain capital regulations to account for changes to credit loss accounting under U.S. GAAP. The 2019 CECL Rule included a transition option that allows banking organizations to phase in, over a three-year period, the day-one adverse effects of adopting a new accounting standard related to the measurement of current expected credit losses CECL on their regulatory capital ratios (three-year transition option). In March 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that maintains the three-year transition option of the 2019 CECL Rule and also provides banking organizations that were required under U.S. GAAP (as of January 2020) to implement CECL before the end of 2020 the option to delay for two years an estimate of the effect of CECL on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). We elected to adopt the five-year transition option. Accordingly, CECL transitional amounts have been added back to CET1 totaling 46.2 million and 61.6 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 The Basel III Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expanded the risk-weighting categories from the general risk-based capital rules to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0 for U.S. government and agency 
 10 

Table of Contents 

 securities, to 600 for certain equity exposures (and higher percentages for certain other types of interests), and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. 
 In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms (the standards are commonly referred to as Basel IV ). Among other things, these standards revise the Basel Committee's standardized approach for credit risk (including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain unconditionally cancellable commitments, such as unused credit card lines of credit) and provides a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. Under the Basel framework, these standards will generally be effective on January 1, 2023, with an aggregate output floor phasing in through January 1, 2028. Under the current U.S. capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions, and not to Cullen/Frost or Frost Bank. The impact of Basel IV on us will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal bank regulators. 
 Liquidity Requirements 
 The Basel III liquidity framework and regulations of the Federal Reserve require that certain banks and bank holding companies measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests. One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio LCR ), is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the entity s expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon (or, if greater, 25 of its expected total cash outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio NSFR ), is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. Rules applicable to certain large banking organizations have been implemented for LCR and for NSFR; however, based on our asset size, these rules do not currently apply to Cullen/Frost and Frost Bank. 
 Prompt Corrective Action 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended FDIA ), requires among other things, the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA includes the following five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. 
 A bank will be (i) well capitalized if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or greater, and a leverage ratio of 5.0 or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; (ii) adequately capitalized if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5 or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 or greater, and a leverage ratio of 4.0 or greater and is not well capitalized (iii) undercapitalized if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0 , a CET1 capital ratio less than 4.5 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0 ; (iv) significantly undercapitalized if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 , a CET1 capital ratio less than 3.0 , a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0 or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0 ; and (v) critically undercapitalized if the institution s tangible equity is equal to or less than 2.0 of average quarterly tangible assets. An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. A bank s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes. 
 The FDIA prohibits an insured depository institution from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank s normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless it is well capitalized or is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. 
 Additionally, the FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. The agencies may not accept such a plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository 
 11 

Table of Contents 

 institution s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository institution s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan. The bank holding company must also provide appropriate assurances of performance. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5.0 of the depository institution s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized and (ii) the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. 
 Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. 
 The appropriate federal banking agency may, under certain circumstances, reclassify a well capitalized insured depository institution as adequately capitalized. The FDIA provides that an institution may be reclassified if the appropriate federal banking agency determines (after notice and opportunity for hearing) that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or deems the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice. The appropriate agency is also permitted to require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory provisions as if the institution were in the next lower category (but not treat a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized) based on supervisory information other than the capital levels of the institution. 
 Cullen/Frost believes that, as of December 31, 2022, its bank subsidiary, Frost Bank, was well capitalized based on the aforementioned ratios. For further information regarding the capital ratios and leverage ratio of Cullen/Frost and Frost Bank see the discussion under the section captioned Capital and Liquidity included in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 9 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, elsewhere in this report. 
 The prompt corrective action regulations do not apply to bank holding companies. However, the Federal Reserve Board is authorized to take appropriate action at the bank holding company level, based upon the undercapitalized status of the bank holding company s depository institution subsidiaries. 
 Safety and Soundness Standards 
 The FDIA requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe standards, by regulations or guidelines, relating to internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, stock valuation and compensation, fees and benefits, and such other operational and managerial standards as the agencies deem appropriate. Guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder. In addition, the agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIA. See Prompt Corrective Action above. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties.

 Deposit Insurance 
 Deposits at Frost Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund DIF of the FDIC and Frost Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. Deposit insurance assessments are based on average total assets minus average tangible equity. For larger institutions, such as Frost Bank, the FDIC uses a performance score and a loss-severity score that are used to calculate an initial assessment rate. In calculating these scores, the FDIC uses a bank s capital level and supervisory ratings and certain financial measures to assess an institution s ability to withstand asset-related stress and funding-related stress. The FDIC has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the calculations. 
 Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. In addition, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of and require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions. 
 In October 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule to increase the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by 2 basis points beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The increased assessment is expected to improve the likelihood that the DIF reserve ratio would reach the statutory minimum of 1.35 by the statutory deadline prescribed under the FDIC's amended restoration plan. 
 Enhanced Prudential Standards 
 The Federal Reserve Board is required to monitor emerging risks to financial stability and enact enhanced supervision and prudential standards applicable to large bank holding companies and certain non-bank covered companies designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act mandates that certain regulatory requirements applicable to these systemically important financial institutions be more stringent than those applicable to other financial institutions. In 2019, the Federal Reserve Board adopted new rules impacting certain capital and liquidity requirements and other enhanced prudential standards. The final rules assign all domestic bank holding companies with 100 billion or more in total consolidated assets to one of four categories of tailored regulatory requirements. Cullen/Frost and Frost Bank are generally not impacted by these rules. The enhanced prudential standards rules, as amended in 2019, require publicly traded bank holding companies with 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets to establish risk committees. Prior to the amendment, the requirement to establish a risk committee was applicable to publicly traded bank holding companies with 10 billion or more in consolidated assets. Cullen/Frost has established and currently maintains a risk committee. 
 The Volcker Rule 
 The so-called Volcker Rule under the Dodd-Frank Act restricts banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds. The Volcker Rule does not significantly impact the operations of Cullen/Frost and its subsidiaries as we do not have any engagement in the businesses prohibited by the Volcker Rule. 
 Depositor Preference 
 The FDIA provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including depositors whose deposits are payable only outside of the United States and the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution. 
 Interchange Fees 
 Under the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve adopted rules establishing standards for assessing whether the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to certain electronic debit transactions are reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by issuers for processing such transactions. 
 13 

Table of Contents 

 Interchange fees, or swipe fees, are charges that merchants pay to us and other card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions. Federal Reserve Board rules applicable to financial institutions that have assets of 10 billion or more provide that the maximum permissible interchange fee for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. An upward adjustment of no more than 1 cent to an issuer's debit card interchange fee is allowed if the card issuer develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve certain fraud-prevention standards. The Federal Reserve Board also has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product. 
 Consumer Financial Protection 
 We are subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern our relationship with our customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act and these laws respective state-law counterparts, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. These and other federal laws, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, restrict our ability to raise interest rates and subject us to substantial regulatory oversight. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys fees. Federal bank regulators, state attorneys general and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by the state and local attorneys general in each jurisdiction in which we operate and civil money penalties. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in our failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions we may wish to pursue or our prohibition from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required. 
 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB is a federal agency responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, laws relating to fair lending and the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumer s ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumer s (i) lack of financial savvy, (ii) inability to protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services, or (iii) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer s interests. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws. The CFPB may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or injunction. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than 10 billion in assets, as well as their affiliates. Banking regulators take into account compliance with consumer protection laws when considering approval of a proposed transaction. 
 Community Reinvestment Act 
 The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 CRA requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practice. Under the CRA, each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by, among other things, providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals and communities. Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the CRA and are assigned ratings. In order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, or to acquire any company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least satisfactory in its most recent examination under the CRA. Furthermore, banking regulators take into account CRA ratings when considering a request for an approval of a proposed transaction. Frost Bank received a rating of satisfactory in its most recent CRA examination. 
 In May 2022, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCC issued a joint proposal that would, among other things (i) expand access to credit, investment and basic banking services in low- and moderate-income communities, (ii) adapt to changes in the banking industry, including internet 
 14 

Table of Contents 

 and mobile banking, (iii) provide greater clarity, consistency and transparency in the application of the regulations and (iv) tailor performance standards to account for differences in bank size, business model, and local conditions. We will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes to the regulations implementing the CRA and their impact to our financial condition, results of operations, and/or liquidity, which cannot be predicted at this time. 
 Financial Privacy 
 The federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. 
 Anti-Money Laundering and the USA Patriot Act 
 A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, or the USA Patriot Act, substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Financial institutions are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must use enhanced due diligence procedures in their dealings with certain types of high-risk customers and implement a written customer identification program. Financial institutions must take certain steps to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and report certain types of suspicious transactions. Regulatory authorities routinely examine financial institutions for compliance with these obligations, and failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious financial, legal and reputational consequences for the institution, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required. Regulatory authorities have imposed cease and desist orders and civil money penalties against institutions found to be violating these obligations. 
 The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 AMLA ), which amends the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 BSA ), was enacted in January 2021. The AMLA is intended to be a comprehensive reform and modernization to U.S. bank secrecy and anti-money laundering laws. Among other things, it codifies a risk-based approach to anti-money laundering compliance for financial institutions; requires the U.S. Department of the Treasury to promulgate priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy; requires the development of standards for testing technology and internal processes for BSA compliance; expands enforcement- and investigation-related authority, including increasing available sanctions for certain BSA violations; and expands BSA whistleblower incentives and protections. Many of the statutory provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemakings, reports and other measures, and the impact of the AMLA will depend on, among other things, rulemaking and implementation guidance. In June 2021, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, issued the priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy required under the AMLA. The priorities include: corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and proliferation financing. 
 Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation 
 The U.S. Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, under authority of various laws, including designated foreign countries, nationals and others. OFAC publishes lists of specially designated targets and countries. We are responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, such targets and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious financial, legal and reputational consequences, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required. Regulatory authorities have imposed cease and desist orders and civil money penalties against institutions found to be violating these obligations.

 Incentive Compensation 
 The Federal Reserve Board reviews, as part of its regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as Cullen/Frost, that are not large, complex banking organizations. These reviews are tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. 
 In June 2010, the Federal Reserve Board, OCC and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization s board of directors. 
 In 2016, the U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board and the SEC, proposed revised rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least 1 billion in total assets (including Cullen/Frost and Frost Bank), but these proposed rules have not been finalized. 
 In October 2022, the SEC adopted a final rule directing national securities exchanges and associations, including the NYSE, to implement listing standards that require listed companies to adopt policies mandating the recovery or clawback of excess incentive-based compensation earned by a current or former executive officer during the three fiscal years preceding the date the listed company is required to prepare an accounting restatement, including to correct an error that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. The final rule requires us to adopt a clawback policy within 60 days after such listing standard becomes effective. 
 Cybersecurity 
 In February 2018, the SEC published interpretive guidance to assist public companies in preparing disclosures about cybersecurity risks and incidents. These SEC guidelines, and any other regulatory guidance, are in addition to notification and disclosure requirements under state and federal banking law and regulations. In addition, in March 2022, the SEC proposed rules that would require disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents, as well as cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance. 
 The federal banking regulators regularly issue new guidance and standards, and update existing guidance and standards, regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management among financial institutions. Financial institutions are expected to comply with such guidance and standards and to accordingly develop appropriate security controls and risk management processes. If we fail to observe such regulatory guidance or standards, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. 
 Under a final rule adopted by federal banking agencies in November 2021, banking organizations are required to notify their primary banking regulator within 36 hours of determining that a computer-security incident has materially disrupted or degraded, or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, the banking organization s ability to carry out banking operations or deliver banking products and services to a material portion of its customer base, its businesses and operations that would result in material loss, or its operations that would impact the stability of the United States. 
 State regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and many states, including Texas, have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification, information security and data privacy requirements. We expect this trend of state-level activity 
 16 

Table of Contents 

 in those areas to continue, and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which our customers are located. 
 Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks, including litigation and enforcement risks, are expected to be elevated for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers. 
 See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity. 
 Future Legislation and Regulation 
 Congress may enact legislation from time to time that affects the regulation of the financial services industry, and state legislatures may enact legislation from time to time affecting the regulation of financial institutions chartered by or operating in those states. Federal and state regulatory agencies also periodically propose and adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. The substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation, or the application thereof, cannot be predicted, although any change could impact the regulatory structure under which we or our competitors operate and may significantly increase costs, impede the efficiency of internal business processes, require an increase in regulatory capital, require modifications to our business strategy, and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. It could also affect our competitors differently than us, including in a manner that would make them more competitive. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to Cullen/Frost or any of its subsidiaries could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Human Capital Resources 
 At December 31, 2022, we employed 4,985 full-time equivalent employees. At that date, the average tenure of all of our full-time employees was approximately 9.9 years while the average tenure of our executive officers was approximately 31.3 years. None of our employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our employee relations to be good. 
 Oversight of our corporate culture is an important element of our board of director s oversight of risk because our people are critical to the success of our corporate strategy. Our board sets the tone at the top, and holds senior management accountable for embodying, maintaining, and communicating our culture to employees. In that regard, our culture is designed to promote our commitment to making people's lives better and to uphold that principle in everything we do. That commitment has been a central pillar in our approach to our employees, our planet and the communities we have proudly served for over 150 years. Our culture is designed to adhere to the timeless values of integrity, caring and excellence. In keeping with that culture, we expect our people to treat each other and our customers with the highest level of honesty and respect and go out of their way to do the right thing, and we strive to be a force for good in everyday life. We dedicate resources to promote a safe and inclusive workplace; attract, develop and retain talented, diverse employees; promote a culture of integrity, caring and excellence; and reward and recognize employees for both the results they deliver and, importantly, how they deliver them. We also seek to design careers that are fulfilling ones, with competitive compensation and benefits alongside a positive work-life balance. We also dedicate resources to fostering professional and personal growth with continuing education, on-the-job training and development programs. This devotion to our people has earned us a spot on Forbes magazine's Best Employers list in 2022. 
 Our employees are key to our success as an organization. We are committed to attracting, retaining and promoting top quality talent regardless of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, color, national origin, age, religion and physical ability. We strive to identify and select the best candidates for all open positions based on qualifying factors for each job. We are dedicated to providing a workplace for our employees that is inclusive, supportive, and free of any form of discrimination or harassment; rewarding and recognizing our employees based on their individual results and performance as well as that of their department and the company overall; and recognizing and respecting all of the characteristics and differences that make each of our employees unique. 
 We believe employing a diverse workforce enhances our ability to serve our customers and our communities. By promoting and fostering a workforce that we believe is reflective of our customers and communities, we seek to better understand the financial needs of our prospects and customers and provide them with relevant financial service products. Understanding and supporting our community has always been a priority to us. We have 
 17 

Table of Contents 

 established a voluntary, employee-led and staffed team that is committed to touching and improving the lives of people that live and work in our community. Additionally, we provide employees the opportunity to use paid time off to perform community service activities in their choice of ways. In 2022, this amounted to approximately 14 thousand hours of community service performed by our employees. Our efforts are designed to enrich the lives of not only those that are in need but also the lives of our employees who participate in these meaningful and rewarding opportunities.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 An investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent to our business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the market price of our common stock and preferred stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment. 
 Risks Related To Our Business 
 Interest Rate Risks 
 We Are Subject To Interest Rate Risk 
 Our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, inflationary trends, changes in government spending and debt issuances and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Open Market Committee. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average duration of our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Any substantial, unexpected, or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the section captioned Net Interest Income and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to interest rate sensitivity and our management of interest rate risk. 
 We May Be Adversely Impacted By The Transition From LIBOR As A Reference Rate 
 The United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority and the administrator of LIBOR have announced that the publication of the most commonly used U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR settings will cease to be published or cease to be representative after June 30, 2023. The publication of all other LIBOR settings ceased to be published as of December 31, 2021. Given consumer protection, litigation, and reputation risks, the bank 
 19 

Table of Contents 

 regulatory agencies indicated that entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate after December 31, 2021, would create safety and soundness risks and that they would examine bank practices accordingly. The Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, enacted in March 2022, provides a statutory framework to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR for contracts governed by U.S. law that have no or ineffective fallbacks, and in December 2022, the Federal Reserve Board adopted related implementing rules. Although governmental authorities have endeavored to facilitate an orderly discontinuation of LIBOR, no assurance can be provided that this aim will be achieved or that the use, level, and volatility of LIBOR or other interest rates or the value of LIBOR-based securities will not be adversely affected. As a result, and despite the enactment of the LIBOR Act, for the most commonly used LIBOR settings, the use or selection of a successor rate could expose us to risks associated with disputes and litigation with our customers and counterparties and other market participants in connection with implementing LIBOR fallback provisions. 
 We discontinued originating LIBOR-based loans effective December 31, 2021 and are now negotiating loans using our preferred replacement index, AMERIBOR, a benchmark developed by the American Financial Exchange, as well as SOFR and BSBY, a benchmark developed by Bloomberg Index Services. 
 As of December 31, 2022, approximately 1.4 billion of our outstanding loans, and, in addition, certain derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments have attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR has resulted in and could continue to result in added costs and employee efforts and could present additional risk. We are subject to litigation and reputational risks if we are unable to renegotiate and amend existing contracts with counterparties that are dependent on LIBOR, including contracts that do not have fallback language. The timing and manner in which each customer s contract transitions to AMERIBOR, SOFR or BSBY will vary on a case-by-case basis. There continues to be substantial uncertainty as to the ultimate effects of the LIBOR transition. Since AMERIBOR, SOFR and BSBY rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR, which may lead to increased volatility as compared to LIBOR. The transition has impacted our market risk profiles and required changes to our risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation. Although we are currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Credit and Lending Risks 
 We Are Subject To Lending Risk and Lending Concentration Risk 
 There are inherent risks associated with our lending activities. These risks include, among other things, the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate as well as those across the State of Texas and the United States. Increases in interest rates and/or weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans. 
 As of December 31, 2022, approximately 86.2 of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial, energy, construction and commercial real estate mortgage loans. These types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default and are typically larger than residential real estate loans or consumer loans. Because our loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and industrial, energy, construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non-performing loans. Increases in non-performing loans have resulted in a net loss of earnings from particular loans, an increase in credit loss expense and an increase in loan charge-offs, and these and future instances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Certain of our credit exposures are concentrated in industries that may be more susceptible to the long-term risks of climate change, natural disasters or global pandemics. To the extent that these risks may have a negative impact on the financial condition of borrowers, it could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See the section captioned Loans in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to commercial and industrial, energy, construction and commercial real estate loans.

 Our Allowance For Credit Losses May Be Insufficient 
 We maintain allowances for credit losses on loans, securities and off-balance sheet credit exposures. In the case of loans and securities, allowances for credit losses are contra-asset valuation accounts that are deducted from the amortized cost basis of these assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. In the case of off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of each allowance account represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. As a result, the determination of the appropriate level of allowance for credit losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates related to current and expected future credit risks and trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Continuing deterioration in economic conditions, including the possibility of a recession, affecting borrowers and securities issuers; inflation; rising interest rates; new information regarding existing loans, credit commitments and securities holdings; the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or other global pandemics; natural disasters and risks related to climate change; and identification of additional problem loans, ratings down-grades and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowances for credit losses on loans, securities and off-balance sheet credit exposures. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require an increase in credit loss expense or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. Furthermore, if any charge-offs related to loans, securities or off-balance sheet credit exposures in future periods exceed our allowances for credit losses on loans, securities or off-balance sheet credit exposures, we will need to recognize additional credit loss expense to increase the applicable allowance. Any increase in the allowance for credit losses on loans, securities and/or off-balance sheet credit exposures will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See the section captioned Allowance for Credit Losses in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to our process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses. 
 We Are Subject to Risk Arising From Conditions In The Commercial Real Estate Market 
 As of December 31, 2022, commercial real estate mortgage loans comprised approximately 36.0 of our loan portfolio. Commercial real estate mortgage loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than residential real estate mortgage loans because they typically have larger balances and are more affected by adverse conditions in the economy. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate often depend upon the successful operation and management of the properties and the businesses which operate from within them, repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower s control, such as adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy or changes in government regulations. In recent years, commercial real estate markets have been particularly impacted by the economic disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has also been a catalyst for the evolution of various remote work options which could impact the long-term performance of some types of office properties within our commercial real estate portfolio. Accordingly, the federal banking regulatory agencies have expressed concerns about weaknesses in the current commercial real estate market. Failures in our risk management policies, procedures and controls could adversely affect our ability to manage this portfolio going forward and could result in an increased rate of delinquencies in, and increased losses from, this portfolio, which, accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We Are Subject To Volatility Risk In Crude Oil Prices 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 925.7 million of energy loans which comprised approximately 5.4 of our loan portfolio at that date. Furthermore, energy production and related industries represent a large part of the economies in some of our primary markets. Actions by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC can impact global crude oil production levels and lead to significant volatility in global oil supplies and market oil prices. In recent years, decreased market oil prices compressed margins for many U.S. and Texas-based oil producers, particularly those that utilize higher-cost production technologies such as hydraulic fracking and horizontal drilling, as well as oilfield service providers, energy equipment manufacturers and transportation suppliers, among others. In March of 2020, disagreements between members of OPEC signaled that 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 production levels would rise and, when coupled with the uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic, led to a significant decline in market oil prices. As the global economy emerged from pandemic lockdowns in 2021, the demand for oil naturally increased and supply could not keep up with the sudden surge in demand. Consequently, oil prices began to rise. The current Russian invasion of Ukraine has also impacted global oil supplies and caused further increases in oil prices. The price per barrel of crude oil was approximately 80 at December 31, 2022 up from 75 at December 31, 2021. We have experienced increased losses within our energy portfolio in recent years which were impacted by oil price volatility, relative to our historical experience. Continued oil price volatility could have further negative impacts on the U.S. economy, in particular, the economies of energy-dominant states such as Texas, and our borrowers and customers. 
 We Are Subject To Environmental Liability Risk Associated With Lending Activities 
 A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit our ability to use or ability to sell the affected property. Environmental reviews of real property before initiating foreclosure actions may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Liquidity Risk 
 We Are Subject To Liquidity Risk 
 We require liquidity to meet our deposit and debt obligations as they come due. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy generally. Factors that could reduce our access to liquidity sources include a downturn in the Texas economy, difficult credit markets or adverse regulatory actions against us. Our access to deposits may also be affected by the liquidity needs of our depositors. In particular, a substantial majority of our liabilities are demand, savings, interest checking and money market deposits, which are payable on demand or upon several days notice, while by comparison, a substantial portion of our assets are loans, which cannot be called or sold in the same time frame. We may not be able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary in the future, especially if a large number of our depositors sought to withdraw their accounts, regardless of the reason. Our access to deposits may be negatively impacted by, among other factors, periods of low interest rates or higher interest rates which could promote increased competition for deposits, including from new financial technology competitors, or provide customers with alternative investment options. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Operational Risks 
 Our Accounting Estimates and Risk Management Processes Rely On Analytical and Forecasting Models 
 The processes we use to estimate our expected credit losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation, including flaws caused by failures in controls, data management, human error or from the reliance on technology. If the models we use for interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, we may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. If the models we use for estimating our expected credit losses are inadequate, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs. If the models we use to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what we could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in our analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 The Value Of Our Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets May Decline In The Future 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 655.3 million of goodwill and other intangible assets. A significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or a significant and sustained decline in the price of Cullen/Frost s common stock may necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We Are Subject To Risk Arising From Failure Or Circumvention Of Our Controls and Procedures 
 Our internal controls, including fraud detection and controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance procedures are based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the controls and procedures are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures; failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures; or failure to comply with our corporate governance procedures could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations, including subjecting us to litigation, regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. Furthermore, notwithstanding the proliferation of technology and technology-based risk and control systems, our businesses ultimately rely on people as our greatest resource, and we are subject to the risk that they make mistakes or engage in violations of applicable policies, laws, rules or procedures that in the past have not, and in the future may not always be prevented by our technological processes or by our controls and other procedures intended to prevent and detect such errors or violations. Human errors, malfeasance and other misconduct, even if promptly discovered and remediated, can result in reputational damage or legal risk and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 New Lines Of Business, Products Or Services and Technological Advancements May Subject Us To Additional Risks 
 From time to time, we implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. For instance, we are currently implementing a new residential mortgage product offering. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services we invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. 
 The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. In addition, our implementation of certain new technologies, such as those related to artificial intelligence, automation and algorithms, in our business processes may have unintended consequences due to their limitations or our failure to use them effectively. In addition, cloud technologies are also critical to the operation of our systems, and our reliance on cloud technologies is growing. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Furthermore, any new line of business, new product or service and/or new technology could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business, new products or services and/or new technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our Reputation and Our Business Are Subject to Negative Publicity Risk 
 Reputation risk, or the risk to our earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion could adversely affect our ability to keep and attract customers and expose us to adverse legal and regulatory consequences. Negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including (i) lending practices, (ii) branching strategy, (iii) product and service offerings, 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 (iv) corporate governance, (v) regulatory compliance, (vi) mergers and acquisitions, (vii) disclosure, (viii) sharing or inadequate protection of customer information, (ix) successful or attempted cyber attacks against us, our customers or our third-party partners or vendors and (x) failure to discharge any publicly announced commitments to employees or environmental, social and governance initiatives or to respond adequately to social and sustainability concerns from the viewpoint of our stakeholders from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to our conduct. Negative public opinion could also result from adverse news or publicity that impairs the reputation of the financial services industry generally or from the actions of our employees, customers, affiliates or third parties with whom we do business. In addition, our reputation or prospects may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding us, whether or not true, that may be posted on social media, non-mainstream news services or other parts of the internet, and this risk is magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels. Because we conduct most of our business under the Frost brand, negative public opinion about one business could affect our other businesses. 
 Our Business, Financial Condition and Results Of Operations Are Subject To Risk From Changes in Customer Behavior 
 Individual, economic, political, industry-specific conditions and other factors outside of our control, such as fuel prices, energy costs, real estate values, inflation, taxes or other factors that affect customer income levels, could alter anticipated customer behavior, including borrowing, repayment, investment and deposit practices. Such a change in these practices could materially adversely affect our ability to anticipate business needs and meet regulatory requirements. Further, difficult economic conditions may negatively affect consumer confidence levels. A decrease in consumer confidence levels would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us, our customers and others in the financial institutions industry. 
 Cullen/Frost Relies On Dividends From Its Subsidiaries For Most Of Its Revenue 
 Cullen/Frost is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiaries. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on Cullen/Frost s common stock and preferred stock and interest and principal on Cullen/Frost s debt. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that Frost Bank and certain non-bank subsidiaries may pay to Cullen/Frost. Also, Cullen/Frost s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors and depositors. In the event Frost Bank is unable to pay dividends to Cullen/Frost, Cullen/Frost may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on our common stock or our preferred stock. The inability to receive dividends from Frost Bank could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See the section captioned Supervision and Regulation in Item 1. Business and Note 9 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data elsewhere in this report. 
 Our Information Systems May Experience Failure, Interruption Or Breach In Security 
 In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to store sensitive data. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in significant disruption to our operations. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, including customer and company information, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, theft, misuse, loss, release or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events. These types of threats may derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties, or may result from accidental technological failure. Our technologies, systems, networks and software have been and continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and attacks, which range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures directed at us. Any failures related to upgrades and maintenance of our technology and information systems could further increase our information and system security risk. Our increased use of cloud and other technologies, such as remote work technologies, also increases our risk of being subject to a cyber attack. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. 
 24 

Table of Contents 

 Our customers, employees and third parties that we do business with have been, and will continue to be, targeted by parties using fraudulent e-mails and other communications in attempts to misappropriate passwords, bank account information or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware programs to our information systems, the information systems of our merchants or third-party service providers and/or our customers' personal devices, which are beyond our security control systems. Though we endeavor to mitigate these threats through product improvements, use of encryption and authentication technology and customer and employee education, such cyber attacks against us, our merchants, our third-party service providers and our customers remain a serious issue and have been successful in the past. 
 Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information systems and have implemented various measures to manage the risks of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Even well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable to attempted security breaches or disruptions because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. Furthermore, in the event of a cyber attack, we may be delayed in identifying or responding to the attack, which could increase the negative impact of the cyber attack on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we maintain specific cyber insurance coverage, which would apply in the event of various breach scenarios, the amount of coverage may not be adequate in any particular case. Furthermore, because cyber threat scenarios are inherently difficult to predict and can take many forms, some breaches may not be covered under our cyber insurance coverage. A security breach or other significant disruption of our information systems or those related to our customers, merchants or our third-party vendors, including as a result of cyber attacks, could (i) disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of our customers; (ii) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers; (iii) result in a violation of applicable privacy, data breach and other laws, subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny and exposing us to civil litigation, enforcement actions, governmental fines and possible financial liability; (iv) require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; or (v) harm our reputation or cause a decrease in the number of customers that choose to do business with us. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our Operations Rely On Certain External Vendors 
 We rely on certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations. These third-party vendors are sources of operational and informational security risk to us, including risks associated with operational errors, information system failures, interruptions or breaches and unauthorized disclosures of sensitive or confidential client or customer information. If these vendors encounter any of these issues, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, we could be exposed to disruption of operations, loss of service or connectivity to customers, reputational damage, and litigation risk that could have a material adverse effect on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. 
 In addition, our operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements. Although we have selected these external vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. The failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements, because of changes in the vendor s organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services or strategic focus or for any other reason, could be disruptive to our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. Replacing these external vendors could also entail significant delay and expense. 
 We Are Subject To Litigation Risk Pertaining To Fiduciary Responsibility 
 From time to time, customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to our performance of our fiduciary responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal action related to our performance of our fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Any financial liability or 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We Are Subject To Litigation Risk Pertaining To Intellectual Property 
 Banking and other financial services companies, including us, rely on technology companies to provide information technology products and services necessary to support day-to-day operations. Technology companies frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. Competitors of our vendors, or other individuals or companies, have from time to time claimed to hold intellectual property sold to us by our vendors or in use by us and we are, and may in the future be, named as defendants in various related legal claims. Such claims may increase in the future as the financial services sector becomes more reliant on information technology vendors. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages and may also seek to enter into licensing agreements with us to obtain ongoing fees. 
 Regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants, we may have to engage in protracted litigation. Such litigation is often expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and distracting to management. If we are found to infringe upon one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, we may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party. In certain cases, we have and in the future may consider entering into licensing agreements for disputed intellectual property, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These licenses may also significantly increase our operating expenses. If legal matters related to intellectual property claims were resolved against us or settled, we could be required to make payments in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Financial Services Companies Depend On The Accuracy and Completeness Of Information About Customers and Counterparties 
 In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, we rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. We also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 External and Market-Related Risks 
 Our Profitability Depends Significantly On Economic Conditions In The State Of Texas 
 Our success depends substantially on the general economic conditions of the State of Texas and the specific local markets in which we operate. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services primarily to customers across Texas through financial centers in the Austin, Corpus Christi, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, Permian Basin, Rio Grande Valley and San Antonio regions. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources. Moreover, all of the securities in our municipal bond portfolio were issued by political subdivisions or agencies within the State of Texas. A significant decline in general economic conditions in Texas, whether caused by recession, inflation, unemployment, changes or prolonged stagnation in oil prices, changes in securities markets, acts of terrorism, pandemics, natural disasters, climate change, outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We Are Subject to Risk Arising From The Soundness Of Other Financial Institutions and Counterparties 
 Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be 
 26 

Table of Contents 

 realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to us. Increased interconnectivity amongst financial institutions also increases the risk of cyber attacks and information system failures for financial institutions. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We Operate In A Highly Competitive Industry and Market Area 
 We face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources than us. Such competitors primarily include national, regional, and community banks within the various markets where we operate. Recent regulation has reduced the regulatory burden of large bank holding companies, and raised the asset thresholds at which more onerous requirements apply, which could cause certain large bank holding companies with less than 250 billion in total consolidated assets, which were previously subject to more stringent enhanced prudential standards, to become more competitive or to pursue expansion more aggressively. 
 We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. 
 Also, technology and other changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. In particular, the activity of fintechs/wealthtechs has grown significantly over recent years and is expected to continue to grow. Some fintechs/wealthtechs are not subject to the same regulation as we are, which may allow them to be more competitive. Fintechs/wealthtechs have and may continue to offer bank or bank-like products and a number of such organizations have applied for bank or industrial loan charters while others have partnered with existing banks to allow them to offer deposit products to their customers. Increased competition from fintechs/wealthechs and the growth of digital banking may also lead to pricing pressures as competitors offer more low-fee and no-fee products. 
 Additionally, consumers can maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. In addition, the emergence, adoption and evolution of new technologies that do not require intermediation, including distributed ledgers such as digital assets and blockchain, as well as advances in robotic process automation, could significantly affect the competition for financial services. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as disintermediation, could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. Further, many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures than us. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things, (i) the ability to develop, maintain and build long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets; (ii) the ability to expand within our marketplace and with our market position; (iii) the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands; (iv) the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors; (v) customer satisfaction with our level of service; and (vi) industry and general economic trends. Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Compliance and Regulatory Risks 
 We Are Subject To Extensive Government Regulation and Supervision and Related Enforcement Powers and Other Legal Remedies 
 We, primarily through Cullen/Frost, Frost Bank and certain non-bank subsidiaries, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, which vests a significant amount of discretion in the various regulatory authorities. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not shareholders. These regulations and supervisory guidance affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or supervisory guidance, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer, limit our ability to return capital to shareholders or conduct certain activities, and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by Federal or state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, enforcement actions or sanctions by regulatory agencies, significant fines and civil money penalties and/or reputational damage. In this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, are pursuing aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures. Directives issued to enforce such actions may be confidential and thus, in some instances, we are not permitted to publicly disclose these actions. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See the sections captioned Supervision and Regulation included in Item 1. Business and Note 9 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data elsewhere in this report. 
 The Repeal Of Federal Prohibitions On Payment Of Interest On Demand Deposits Could Increase Our Interest Expense 
 All federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on demand deposit accounts were repealed as part of the Dodd-Frank Act beginning on July 21, 2011. As a result, some financial institutions offer interest on demand deposits to compete for customers. Our interest expense will increase and our net interest margin will decrease if we begin offering interest on demand deposits to attract additional customers or maintain current customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We Are Subject To Government Regulation and Oversight Relating to Data and Privacy Protection 
 Our business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including personally identifiable information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide data services. We also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and information relating to our operations. The integrity and protection of that customer and company data is important to us. Our collection of such customer and company data is subject to extensive regulation and oversight. 
 We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of our customers, employees and others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage. As new privacy-related laws and regulations are implemented, the time and resources needed for us to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as our potential liability for non-compliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches, may significantly increase. 
 Risks Related to Acquisition Activity 
 Potential Acquisitions May Disrupt Our Business and Dilute Shareholder Value 
 We generally seek merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things, (i) potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company; (ii) exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company; (iii) potential disruption to our business; (iv) potential diversion of our management s time and attention; (v) the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company; (vi) difficulty in estimating the value of the target company; and (vii) potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company. 
 Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Acquisitions may also result in potential dilution to existing shareholders of our earnings per share if we issue common stock in connection with the acquisition. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Acquisitions May Be Delayed, Impeded, Or Prohibited Due To Regulatory Issues 
 Acquisitions by financial institutions, including us, are subject to approval by a variety of federal and state regulatory agencies (collectively, regulatory approvals ). The process for obtaining these required regulatory approvals has become substantially more difficult since the global financial crisis, and our ability to engage in certain merger or acquisition transactions depends on the bank regulators' views at the time as to our capital levels, quality of management, and overall condition, in addition to their assessment of a variety of other factors, including our compliance with law. Regulatory approvals could be delayed, impeded, restrictively conditioned or denied due to existing or new regulatory issues we have, or may have, with regulatory agencies, including, without limitation, issues related to Bank Secrecy Act compliance, Community Reinvestment Act issues, fair lending laws, fair housing laws, consumer protection laws, unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices regulations and other laws and regulations. We may fail to pursue, evaluate or complete strategic and competitively significant acquisition opportunities as a result of our inability, or perceived or anticipated inability, to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, under reasonable conditions or at all. Difficulties associated with potential acquisitions that may result from these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Risks Associated With Our Common Stock and Preferred Stock 
 The Trading Volumes In Our Common Stock and Preferred Stock Are Less Than That Of Other Larger Financial Services Companies 
 Although our common stock and preferred stock are listed for trading on the NYSE, the trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other, larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock and preferred stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the lower trading volumes of our common stock and preferred stock, significant sales of our common stock or our preferred stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause our stock prices to fall. 
 Cullen/Frost May Not Continue To Pay Dividends On Its Common Stock In The Future 
 Holders of Cullen/Frost common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as its board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although Cullen/Frost has historically declared cash dividends on its common stock, it is not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate its common stock dividend in the future. This could adversely affect the market price of Cullen/Frost s common stock. Also, Cullen/Frost is a bank holding company, and its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board regarding capital adequacy and dividends. 
 As more fully discussed in Note 9 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data elsewhere in this report, our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock may also be subject to certain restrictions in the event that we elect to defer the payment of interest on our junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures or do not declare and pay dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock. 
 An Investment In Our Common Stock or Preferred Stock Is Not An Insured Deposit 
 Our common stock and preferred stock are not bank deposits and, therefore, are not insured against loss by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ), any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our common stock or preferred stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock or preferred stock in any company. As a result, if you acquire our common stock or preferred stock, you could lose some or all of your investment. 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 Certain Banking Laws May Have An Anti-Takeover Effect 
 Provisions of federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions effectively inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
 General Risk Factors 
 We are Subject To Risk From Fluctuating Conditions In The Financial Markets and Economic and Political Conditions Generally 
 Our success depends, to a certain extent, upon local, national and global economic and political conditions, as well as governmental monetary policies. Our financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where we operate, in the State of Texas and in the United States as a whole. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by a decline in economic growth both in the U.S. and internationally; declines in business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability of or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment; oil price volatility; natural disasters; trade policies and tariffs; or a combination of these or other factors. In addition, financial markets and global supply chains may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including the current Russian invasion of Ukraine, terrorism or other geopolitical events. Current economic conditions are being heavily impacted by elevated levels of inflation and rising interest rates. A prolonged period of inflation may impact our profitability by negatively impacting our fixed costs and expenses. Economic and inflationary pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding economic improvement could result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing and savings habits. Such conditions could have a material adverse effect on the credit quality of our loans and our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, evolving responses from federal and state governments and other regulators, and our customers or our third-party partners or vendors, to new challenges such as climate change have impacted and could continue to impact the economic and political conditions under which we operate which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Changes In The Federal, State Or Local Tax Laws May Negatively Impact Our Financial Performance and We Are Subject To Examinations and Challenges By Tax Authorities 
 We are subject to federal and applicable state tax laws and regulations. Changes in these tax laws and regulations, some of which may be retroactive to previous periods, could increase our effective tax rates and, as a result, could negatively affect our current and future financial performance. Furthermore, tax laws and regulations are often complex and require interpretation. In the normal course of business, we are routinely subject to examinations and challenges from federal and applicable state tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in connection with investments we have made and the businesses in which we have engaged. Recently, federal and state taxing authorities have become increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions. These tax positions may relate to tax compliance, sales and use, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues, including tax base, apportionment and tax credit planning. The challenges made by tax authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We May Need To Raise Additional Capital In The Future, and Such Capital May Not Be Available When Needed Or At All 
 We may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs, particularly if our asset quality or earnings were to deteriorate significantly. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and our financial condition. Economic conditions and the loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase our cost of funding and limit access to certain customary 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 sources of capital, including inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the Federal Reserve. 
 We cannot assure that such capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers, depositors of Frost Bank or counterparties participating in the capital markets, or a downgrade of Cullen/Frost s or Frost Bank s debt ratings, may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. Moreover, if we need to raise capital in the future, we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would have to compete with those institutions for investors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our Stock Price Can Be Volatile 
 Stock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things, (i) actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations; (ii) recommendations by securities analysts; (iii) operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us; (iv) news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry; (v) perceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors; (vi) new technology used, or services offered, by competitors; (vii) the issuance by us of additional securities, including common stock and securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock; (viii) sales of a large block of shares of our common stock or similar securities in the market after an equity offering, or the perception that such sales could occur; (ix) significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors; (x) failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions; (xi) changes in government regulations; and (xii) geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts. 
 General market fluctuations, including real or anticipated changes in the strength of the Texas economy; industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions; and interest rate changes, oil price volatility or credit loss trends could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results. 
 Changes In Accounting Standards Could Materially Impact Our Financial Statements 
 From time to time accounting standards setters change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in changes to previously reported financial results or a cumulative charge to retained earnings. See Note 20 - Accounting Standards Updates in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data elsewhere in this report for further information regarding pending accounting standards updates. 
 We May Not Be Able To Attract and Retain Skilled People 
 Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in many activities engaged in by us is intense including with respect to compensation and emerging workplace practices, accommodations and remote work options, and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them. We do not currently have employment agreements or non-competition agreements with any of our senior officers. The unexpected loss of services of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations because of their customer relationships, skills, knowledge of our market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. In addition, the scope and content of U.S. banking regulators' policies on incentive compensation, as well as changes to these policies, could adversely affect our ability to hire, retain and motivate our key employees. 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 Severe Weather, Natural Disasters, Acts Of War Or Terrorism and Other Adverse External Events Could Significantly Impact Our Business and Our Customers 
 Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. In addition, such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. Furthermore, the occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Climate Change Could Have a Material Negative Impact on Us and Our Customers 
 Our business, as well as the operations and activities of our customers, could be negatively impacted by climate change. Climate change presents both immediate and long-term risks to us and our customers and these risks are expected to increase over time. Climate changes presents multi-faceted risks, including (i) operational risk from the physical effects of climate events on our facilities and other assets as well as those of our customers; (ii) credit risk from borrowers with significant exposure to climate risk; and (iii) reputational risk from stakeholder concerns about our practices related to climate change, our carbon footprint and our business relationships with customers who operate in carbon-intensive industries. Our business, reputation and ability to attract and retain employees may also be harmed if our response to climate change is perceived to be ineffective or insufficient. 
 Climate change exposes us to physical risk as its effects may lead to more frequent and more extreme weather events, such as prolonged droughts or flooding, tornados, hurricanes, wildfires and extreme seasonal weather; and longer-term shifts, such as increasing average temperatures, ozone depletion and rising sea levels. Such events and long-term shifts may damage, destroy or otherwise impact the value or productivity of our properties and other assets; reduce the availability of insurance; and/or disrupt our operations and other activities through prolonged outages. Such events and long-term shifts may also have a significant impact on our customers, which could amplify credit risk by diminishing borrowers repayment capacity or collateral values, and other businesses and counterparties with whom we transact, which could have a broader impact on the economy, supply chains and distribution networks. 
 Climate change also exposes us to transition risks associated with the transition to a less carbon-dependent economy. Transition risks may result from changes in policies; laws and regulations; technologies; and/or market preferences to address climate change. Such changes could materially, negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or our reputation, in addition to having a similar impact on our customers. We have customers who operate in carbon-intensive industries like oil and gas that are exposed to climate risks, such as those risks related to the transition to a less carbon-dependent economy, as well as customers who operate in low-carbon industries that may be subject to risks associated with new technologies. Federal and state banking regulators and supervisory authorities, investors and other stakeholders have increasingly viewed financial institutions as important in helping to address the risks related to climate change both directly and with respect to their customers, which may result in financial institutions coming under increased pressure regarding the disclosure and management of their climate risks and related lending and investment activities. Given that climate change could impose systemic risks upon the financial sector, either via disruptions in economic activity resulting from the physical impacts of climate change or changes in policies as the economy transitions to a less carbon-intensive environment, we face regulatory risk of increasing focus on our resilience to climate-related risks, including in the context of stress testing for various climate stress scenarios. Ongoing legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding climate risk management and practices may result in higher regulatory, compliance, credit and reputational risks and costs.

 Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates 
 We follow accounting and reporting policies that conform, in all material respects, to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and to general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. While we base estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 We consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if (i) the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and (ii) different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial statements. 
 Accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses on financial instruments including loans and off-balance-sheet credit exposures are considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management. As discussed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, our policies related to allowances for credit losses changed on January 1, 2020 in connection with the adoption of a new accounting standard update as codified in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 326 ASC 326 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. In the case of loans, the allowance for credit losses is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. 
 In the case of off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of each allowance account represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant factors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets. See the section captioned Allowance for Credit Losses elsewhere in this discussion as well as Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 - Loans in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data elsewhere in this report for further details of the risk factors considered by management in estimating the necessary level of the allowance for credit losses.

 Overview 
 The following discussion and analysis presents the more significant factors that affected our financial condition as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and results of operations for each of the years then ended. Refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 4, 2021 (the 2021 Form 10-K for a discussion and analysis of the more significant factors that affected periods prior to 2021. 
 Certain reclassifications have been made to make prior periods comparable. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. From time to time, we have acquired various small businesses through our insurance subsidiary. None of these acquisitions had a significant impact on our financial statements. We account for acquisitions using the acquisition method, and as such, the results of operations of acquired companies are included from the date of acquisition. 
 Taxable-equivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from tax-free loans and investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable, thus making tax-exempt yields comparable to taxable asset yields. Taxable equivalent adjustments were based upon a 21 income tax rate. 
 Dollar amounts in tables are stated in thousands, except for per share amounts. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Net income available to common shareholders totaled 572.5 million, or 8.81 diluted per common share, in 2022 compared to 435.9 million, or 6.76 diluted per common share, in 2021 and 323.6 million, or 5.10 diluted per common share, in 2020. 
 Selected income statement data, returns on average assets and average equity and dividends per share for the comparable periods were as follows: 
 2022 2021 2020 Taxable-equivalent net interest income 1,386,981 1,077,315 1,070,937 Taxable-equivalent adjustment 95,698 92,448 94,936 Net interest income 1,291,283 984,867 976,001 Credit loss expense 3,000 63 241,230 Non-interest income 404,818 386,728 465,454 Non-interest expense 1,024,274 881,994 848,904 Income before income taxes 668,827 489,538 351,321 Income tax expense 89,677 46,459 20,170 Net income 579,150 443,079 331,151 Preferred stock dividends 6,675 7,157 2,016 Redemption of preferred stock 5,514 Net income available to common shareholders 572,475 435,922 323,621 Earnings per common share - basic 8.84 6.79 5.11 Earnings per common share - diluted 8.81 6.76 5.10 Dividends per common share 3.24 2.94 2.85 Return on average assets 1.11 0.95 0.85 Return on average common equity 16.86 10.35 8.11 Average shareholders' equity to average assets 6.87 9.48 10.64 
 Net income available to common shareholders increased 136.6 million for 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily the result of a 306.4 million increase in net interest income and a 18.1 million increase in non-interest income partly offset by a 142.3 million increase in non-interest expense and a 43.2 million increase in income tax expense. 
 Details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below.

 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, which are used to fund those assets. Net interest income is our largest source of revenue, representing 76.1 of total revenue during 2022. Net interest margin is the ratio of taxable-equivalent net interest income to average earning assets for the period. The level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin. 
 The Federal Reserve influences the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions. Our loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 42.7 of our loans had a fixed interest rate, while the remaining loans had floating interest rates that were primarily tied to the prime interest rate (approximately 27.7 or the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR (approximately 8.2 ). We discontinued originating LIBOR-based loans effective December 31, 2021 and have begun to negotiate loans using our preferred replacement index, the American Interbank Offered Rate AMERIBOR ), a benchmark developed by the American Financial Exchange, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR or a benchmark developed by Bloomberg Index Services BSBY ). As of December 31, 2022, approximately, 21.4 of our loans were tied to one of these three indexes. For our currently outstanding LIBOR-based loans, the timing and manner in which each customer s contract transitions from LIBOR to another rate will vary on a case-by-case basis. Our goal is to complete all transitions by the end of first quarter of 2023.

 As of December 31, 2022, the target range for the federal funds rate was 4.25 to 4.50 . In December 2022, the Federal Reserve released projections whereby the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate would rise to 5.1 by the end of 2023 and subsequently decrease to 4.1 by the end of 2024. While there can be no such assurance that any increases or decreases in the federal funds rate will occur, these projections imply up to a 75 basis point increase in the federal funds rate during 2023, followed by a 100 basis point decrease in 2024. The target range for the federal funds rate was increased 25 basis points to 4.50 to 4.75 effective February 2, 2023. 
 We are primarily funded by core deposits, with non-interest-bearing demand deposits historically being a significant source of funds. This lower-cost funding base is expected to have a positive impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in a rising interest rate environment. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk elsewhere in this report for information about our sensitivity to interest rates. Further analysis of the components of our net interest margin is presented below.

 The following table presents the changes in taxable-equivalent net interest income and identifies the changes due to differences in the average volume of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the changes due to changes in the average interest rate on those assets and liabilities. The changes in net interest income due to changes in both average volume and average interest rate have been allocated to the average volume change or the average interest rate change in proportion to the absolute amounts of the change in each. The comparison between 2021 and 2020 includes an additional change factor that shows the effect of the difference in the number of days (due to leap year in 2020) in each period for assets and liabilities that accrue interest based upon the actual number of days in the period, as further discussed below.

 Taxable-equivalent net interest income for 2022 increased 309.7 million, or 28.7 , compared to 2021. The increase in taxable-equivalent net interest income during 2022 was primarily related to an increase in the average yield on interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve); an increase in the average volume of, and to a much lesser extent, an increase in the yield on taxable securities; an increase in the average yield on loans; and an increase in the average volume of, and to a lesser extent, an increase in the average taxable-equivalent yield on tax-exempt securities. The impact of these items was partly offset by an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposit accounts (primarily money market deposit accounts) and an increase in the average cost of repurchase agreements, among other things. As a result of the aforementioned fluctuations, the taxable-equivalent net interest margin increased 29 basis points from 2.53 during 2021 to 2.82 during 2022. 
 The average volume of interest-earning assets for 2022 increased 5.1 billion, or 11.8 , compared to 2021. The increase in the average volume of interest-earning assets during 2022 included a 6.1 billion increase in average taxable securities, a 22.3 million increase in average federal funds sold and a 10.5 million increase in average resell agreements partly offset by a 746.8 million decrease in average interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held by us in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve), a 270.6 million decrease in average tax-exempt securities, and a 30.9 million decrease in average loans (of which approximately 1.7 billion related to PPP loans, as further discussed below). 
 The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 62 basis points from 2.58 during 2021 to 3.20 during 2022 while the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 54 basis points from 0.10 in 2021 to 0.64 in 2022. The average taxable-equivalent yields on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities were primarily impacted by the aforementioned changes in market interest rates and changes in the volume and relative mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

 The average taxable-equivalent yield on loans increased 59 basis points from 4.05 during 2021 to 4.64 during 2022. The average taxable-equivalent yield on loans during 2022 was positively impacted by recent increases in market interest rates. The average taxable-equivalent yield on loans during 2021 was positively impacted by a higher average proportion of higher-yielding PPP loans to total loans compared to 2022. The average volume of loans decreased 30.9 million, or 0.2 , in 2022 compared to 2021. The average volume of loans during 2022 was impacted by decrease in the average volume of PPP loans. Excluding PPP loans, average loans would have increased 1.7 billion, or 11.3 , during 2022 compared to 2021. Loans made up approximately 34.7 of average interest-earning assets during 2022 compared to 38.8 during 2021. 
 During 2022 and 2021, we recognized 2.6 million and 97.3 million, respectively, in PPP loan related deferred processing fees (net of amortization of related deferred origination costs) as a yield adjustment and this amount is included in interest income on loans. As a result of the inclusion of these net fees in interest income, the average yields on PPP loans were 2.84 and 6.26 during 2022 and 2021, respectively, compared to the stated interest rate of 1.0 on these loans. 
 The average taxable-equivalent yield on securities was 2.95 during 2022, decreasing 34 basis points compared to 3.29 during 2021 and was negatively impacted by a decrease in the relative proportion of higher-yielding tax-exempt securities to total securities. The average yield on taxable securities was 2.16 during 2022 compared to 1.97 during 2021, increasing 19 basis points, while the average yield on tax exempt securities was 4.08 during 2022 compared to 4.06 during 2021, increasing 2 basis points. Tax exempt securities made up approximately 42.7 of total average securities during 2022, compared to 64.2 during 2021. The average volume of total securities increased 5.8 billion, or 45.4 , during 2022 compared to 2021. Securities made up approximately 38.7 of average interest-earning assets in 2022 compared to 29.8 in 2021. The increase during 2022 was primarily related to the investment of available funds (primarily from growth in customer deposits and reinvestment of amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) into taxable securities. 
 Average interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held by us in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve), during 2022 decreased 746.8 million, or 5.5 , compared to 2021. Interest-bearing deposits made up approximately 26.5 of average interest-earning assets during 2022 compared to approximately 31.3 in 2021. The decrease during 2022 was primarily related to the reinvestment of amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve into taxable securities. The average yield on interest-bearing deposits was 1.69 during 2022 and 0.13 during 2021. The average yields on interest-bearing deposits during 2022 was impacted by higher interest rates paid on reserves held at the Federal Reserve, compared to 2021. 
 Average federal funds sold and resell agreements during 2022 increased 22.3 million, or 150.5 , and 10.5 million, or 158.3 , respectively, compared to 2021. Federal funds sold and resell agreements were not a significant component of interest-earning assets during the comparable periods. The average yields on federal funds sold and resell agreements were 2.55 and 3.47 , respectively, during 2022 compared to 0.21 and 0.24 , respectively, during 2021. The average yields on federal funds sold and resell agreements were positively impacted by higher average market interest rates during 2022 compared to 2021. 
 The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 0.64 during 2022, increasing 54 basis points from 0.10 during 2021. Average deposits increased 6.1 billion, or 15.9 , in 2022 compared to 2021. Average interest-bearing deposits increased 4.6 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, while average non-interest-bearing deposits increased 1.5 billion in 2022 compared to 2021. The ratio of average interest-bearing deposits to total average deposits was 59.2 in 2022 compared to 56.7 in 2021. The average cost of deposits is primarily impacted by changes in market interest rates as well as changes in the volume and relative mix of interest-bearing deposits. The average rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and total deposits were 0.53 and 0.32 , respectively, in 2022 compared to 0.07 and 0.04 , respectively, in 2021. The average cost of deposits during 2022 was impacted by an increase in the interest rates we pay on most of our interest-bearing deposit products as a result of the aforementioned increase in market interest rates. 
 Our taxable-equivalent net interest spread, which represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, was 2.56 in 2022 compared to 2.48 in 2021. The net interest spread, as well as the net interest margin, will be impacted by future changes in short-term and long-term interest rate levels, as well as the impact from the competitive environment. A discussion of the effects of changing interest rates on net interest income is set forth in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk elsewhere in this report.

 Our hedging policies permit the use of various derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, swaptions, caps and floors, to manage exposure to changes in interest rates. Details of our derivatives and hedging activities are set forth in Note 15 - Derivative Financial Instruments in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report. Information regarding the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on our derivative financial instruments is set forth in Item 7A.

 Credit Loss Expense 
 Credit loss expense is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for credit loss accounts for various types of financial instruments including loans, securities and off-balance-sheet credit exposure after net charge-offs have been deducted to bring the allowance to a level which, in management s best estimate, is necessary to absorb expected credit losses over the lives of the respective financial instruments. 
 The components of credit loss expense were as follows. 
 2022 2021 2020 Credit loss expense related to: Loans (5,279) (6,097) 237,010 Off-balance-sheet credit exposures 8,279 6,162 4,275 Securities held to maturity (2) (55) Total 3,000 63 241,230 
 See the section captioned Allowance for Credit Losses elsewhere in this discussion for further analysis of credit loss expense related to loans and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. 
 
 Non-Interest Income 
 Total non-interest income for 2022 increased 18.1 million, or 4.7 , compared to 2021. Changes in the various components of non-interest income are discussed in more detail below. 
 Trust and Investment Management Fees. Trust and investment management fee income for 2022 increased 5.7 million, or 3.8 , compared to 2021. Investment management fees are the most significant component of trust and investment management fees, making up approximately 77.1 and 82.3 of total trust and investment management fees in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in trust and investment management fees during 2022 was primarily due to increases in oil and gas fees (up 6.1 million), real estate fees (up 2.0 million) and estate fees (up 976 thousand) partly offset by a decrease in investment management fees (down 3.4 million). Oil and gas fees during 2022 were impacted by increases in oil and gas prices. The increases in real estate fees and estate fees were primarily related to increased transaction volumes and transaction fees. Investment management fees are generally based on the market value of assets within an account and are thus impacted by volatility in the equity and bond markets. The decrease in investment management fees during 2022 was primarily related to lower average equity valuations, in part related to the sharp decline in equity valuations during 2022. 
 At December 31, 2022, trust assets, including both managed assets and custody assets, were primarily composed of equity securities (40.2 of trust assets), fixed income securities (33.8 of trust assets), alternative investments (8.7 of assets) and cash equivalents (10.2 of trust assets). The estimated fair value of trust assets was 43.6 billion (including managed assets of 21.4 billion and custody assets of 22.2 billion) at December 31, 2022 compared to 43.3 billion (including managed assets of 19.1 billion and custody assets of 24.2 billion) at December 31, 2021. 
 Service Charges on Deposit Accounts. Service charges on deposit accounts for 2022 increased 8.6 million, or 10.3 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily related to increases in overdraft charges on consumer and commercial accounts (up 5.3 million and 2.3 million, respectively) and consumer service charges (up 1.0 million). 
 Overdraft charges totaled 38.3 million 29.2 million consumer and 9.1 million commercial) during 2022 compared to 30.7 million 23.9 million consumer and 6.8 million commercial) during 2021. The increase in overdraft charges during 2022 was impacted by increases in the volume of fee assessed overdrafts relative to 2021, in part due to growth in the number of accounts. The increase in consumer service charges during 2022 was partly related to increases in overall deposit accounts and volumes.

Table of Contents 

 In April 2021, we implemented a new overdraft grace feature for certain consumer demand deposit accounts whereby no fees would be assessed on overdrafts of 100 or less, subject to certain qualifying conditions such as a minimum direct deposit. This new feature reduced overdraft charges on consumer accounts by approximately 3.2 million during 2021. In June 2022, we expanded the overdraft grace feature first implemented in April 2021. This feature, which was previously only available to certain consumer demand deposit accounts, is now available to all of our consumer demand deposit accounts, regardless of direct deposit status. With this feature, no fees will be assessed on overdrafts of 100 or less. Additionally, we also eliminated fees on non-sufficient and returned items for all consumer deposit accounts. We expect these changes will impact revenue by as much as 3.5 million on an annual basis. 
 Insurance Commissions and Fees. Insurance commissions and fees for 2022 increased 1.7 million, or 3.2 , compared to 2021. The increase was the result of an increase in commission income (up 2.7 million) partly offset by a decrease in contingent income (down 1.0 million). The increase in commission income was primarily related to increases in commercial and, to a lesser extent, personal lines property and casualty commissions. These increases were related to increased business volumes and increased market rates. The increases in property and casualty commissions were partly offset by a decreases in life insurance commissions and benefit plan commissions. These decreases were primarily due to decreased business volumes. The decrease in benefit plan commissions was partly offset by the impact of an increase in market rates. 
 Contingent income totaled 3.5 million in 2022 and 4.5 million in 2021. Contingent income primarily consists of amounts received from various property and casualty insurance carriers related to the loss performance of insurance policies previously placed. These performance related contingent payments are seasonal in nature and are mostly received during the first quarter of each year. This performance related contingent income totaled 1.9 million in 2022 and 3.2 million in 2021. The decrease in performance related contingent income during 2022 was related to low growth within the portfolio and a deterioration in the loss performance of insurance policies previously placed. This deterioration was impacted by a severe weather event in Texas during the first quarter of 2021 that resulted in a significant increase in property and casualty claims and losses. Contingent income also includes amounts received from various benefit plan insurance companies related to the volume of business generated and/or the subsequent retention of such business. This benefit plan related contingent income totaled 1.6 million in 2022 and 1.3 million in 2021. 
 Interchange and Card Transaction Fees. Interchange fees, or swipe fees, are charges that merchants pay to us and other card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions. Interchange and card transaction fees consist of income from check card usage, point of sale income from PIN-based debit card transactions and ATM service fees. Interchange and card transaction fees are reported net of related network costs. 
 Net revenues from interchange and card transaction fees for 2022 increased 770 thousand, or 4.4 , compared to 2021 primarily due to increased transaction volumes as well as the impact of new card products partly offset by an increase in network costs. A comparison of gross and net interchange and card transaction fees for the reported periods is presented in the table below. 
 2022 2021 2020 Income from debit card transactions 32,457 29,122 23,763 ATM service fees 3,313 3,298 3,342 Gross interchange and debit card transaction fees 35,770 32,420 27,105 Network costs 17,539 14,959 13,635 Net interchange and debit card transaction fees 18,231 17,461 13,470 
 Federal Reserve rules applicable to financial institutions that have assets of 10 billion or more provide that the maximum permissible interchange fee for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. An upward adjustment of no more than 1 cent to an issuer's debit card interchange fee is allowed if the card issuer develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve certain fraud-prevention standards. The Federal Reserve also has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product.

 Other Charges, Commissions and Fees. Other charges, commissions and fees for 2022 increased 4.8 million, or 12.9 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily related to increases in income from the placement of money market accounts (up 4.0 million), merchant services rebates/bonuses (up 1.3 million) and letter of credit fees (up 1.1 million), among other things, partly offset by a decrease in income from the sale of mutual funds (down 1.7 million), among other things. 
 Net Gain/Loss on Securities Transactions . There were no sales of securities during 2022. During 2021, we sold certain available-for-sale securities with amortized costs totaling 2.0 billion and realized a net gain of 69 thousand. These sales were primarily related to securities purchased during 2021 and subsequently sold in connection with our tax planning strategies related to the Texas franchise tax. The gross proceeds from the sales of these securities outside of Texas are included in total revenues/receipts from all sources reported for Texas franchise tax purposes, which results in a reduction in the overall percentage of revenues/receipts apportioned to Texas and subjected to taxation under the Texas franchise tax. 
 Other Non-Interest Income. Other non-interest income for 2022 decreased 3.3 million, or 6.8 , compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in gains on the sale/exchange of assets (down 11.7 million) and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in income from customer derivative and securities trading transactions (down 2.3 million), among other things. These items were partly offset by increases in sundry and other miscellaneous income (up 9.2 million), public finance underwriting fees (up 1.7 million) and income from customer foreign exchange transactions (up 1.4 million), among other things. Gains on the sale/exchange of assets in 2021 included 9.7 million related to an exchange of a branch facility and 1.8 million related to the sale of certain parking lots in downtown San Antonio. The decrease in income from customer derivative transactions was primarily due to a decrease in transaction volume. Sundry income during 2022 included 6.3 million in card related incentives/rebates, 5.1 million related to a partnership interest and 1.4 million related to the recovery of prior write-offs, among other things, while sundry and other miscellaneous income during 2021 included 3.4 million in card related incentives/rebates and 519 thousand in recoveries of prior write-offs, among other things. The increases in public finance underwriting fees and income from customer foreign exchange transactions were primarily related to increases in transaction volumes. 
 
 Non-Interest Expense 
 Total non-interest expense for 2022 increased 142.3 million, or 16.1 , compared to 2021. Changes in the various components of non-interest expense are discussed below. 
 Salaries and Wages. Salaries and wages increased 96.6 million, or 24.4 , in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase in salaries and wages was primarily related to increases in salaries due to annual merit and market increases as well as the implementation of a 20 per hour minimum wage in December, 2021. We are also experiencing a competitive labor market which has resulted in and could continue to result in an increase in our staffing costs. Salaries and wages were also impacted by an increase in the number of employees, increases in incentive and stock-based compensation and commissions and a decrease in salary costs deferred in connection with loan originations as the first quarter of 2021 was impacted by the high volume of PPP loan originations. The increase in the number of employees was partly related to our investments in organic expansion in the Houston and Dallas markets as well as preparations for our mortgage loan product offering. 
 Employee Benefits . Employee benefits expense for 2022 increased 6.6 million, or 8.0 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily related to increases in payroll taxes, medical benefits expense, 401(k) plan expense and other employee benefits, among other things, partly offset by an increase in the net periodic benefits related to our defined benefit retirement plan. Employee benefits expense was impacted by the aforementioned higher salary costs and increase in the number of employees. 
 Our defined benefit retirement and restoration plans were frozen in 2001 which has helped to reduce the volatility in retirement plan expense. We nonetheless still have funding obligations related to these plans and could recognize additional expense related to these plans in future years, which would be dependent on the return earned on plan assets, the level of interest rates and employee turnover. See Note 12 - Defined Benefit Plans for additional information related to our net periodic pension benefit/cost. 
 Net Occupancy. Net occupancy expense for 2022 increased 5.2 million, or 4.8 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily related to increases in repairs and maintenance/service contracts expense (up 2.0 million), lease expense (up 1.8 million), depreciation on buildings and leasehold improvements (together up 1.3 million) and insurance expense (up 609 thousand), among other things, partly offset by a decrease in property taxes (down

 1.6 million). The increases in the aforementioned components of net occupancy expense were driven, in part, by our expansion within the Houston and Dallas market areas. 
 Technology, Furniture and Equipment. Technology, furniture and equipment expense for 2022 increased 8.0 million, or 7.1 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily related to increases in cloud services expense (up 3.9 million), service contracts expense (up 1.4 million), software maintenance (up 1.3 million) and depreciation of furniture and equipment (up 989 thousand), among other things. 
 Deposit Insurance. Deposit insurance expense totaled 15.6 million in 2022 compared to 12.2 million in 2021. The increase was primarily related to an increase in total assets. In October 2022, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation adopted a final rule to increase the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by 2 basis points beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. 
 Other Non-Interest Expense. Other non-interest expense for 2022 increased 22.8 million, or 13.3 , compared to 2021. The increase included increases in professional services expense (up 6.2 million); advertising/promotions expense (up 5.5 million); travel, meals and entertainment (up 5.4 million); fraud losses (up 5.0 million); business development expense (up 1.3 million); sundry and other miscellaneous expense (up 1.1 million); and stationery, printing and supplies expense (up 1.0 million), among other things. Other non-interest expense during 2022 was also impacted by a decrease in costs deferred as loan origination costs (down 1.3 million) as the first quarter of 2021 was impacted by a large volume of PPP loan originations. The impact of the aforementioned items was partly offset by a decrease in donations expense (down 9.0 million), which was impacted by 8.8 million in contributions to the Frost Charitable Foundation during 2021, among other things. Sundry and other miscellaneous expense in 2022 included accruals totaling 5.9 million, which included 4.0 million related to a license negotiation and 1.9 million related to other matters. Sundry and other miscellaneous expense in 2021 included 4.7 million related to the write-off of certain assets. 
 
 Results of Segment Operations 
 We are managed under a matrix organizational structure whereby our two primary operating segments, Banking and Frost Wealth Advisors, overlap a regional reporting structure. A third operating segment, Non-Banks, is for the most part the parent holding company, as well as certain other insignificant non-bank subsidiaries of the parent that, for the most part, have little or no activity. A description of each business and the methodologies used to measure financial performance is described in Note 18 - Operating Segments in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report. Net income (loss) by operating segment is presented below: 
 Banking 
 Net income for 2022 increased 136.5 million, or 32.9 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily the result of a 305.6 million increase in net interest income and a 10.2 million increase in non-interest income partly offset by a 132.7 million increase in non-interest expense, a 43.6 million increase in income tax expense and a 2.9 million increase in credit loss expense. 
 Net interest income for 2022 increased 305.6 million, or 30.9 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily related to an increase in the average yield on interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve); an increase in the average volume of, and to a lesser extent, an increase in the yield on taxable securities; an increase in the average yield on loans; and an increase in the average volume of, and to a lesser extent, an increase in the average taxable-equivalent yield on tax-exempt securities. The impact of these items was partly offset by an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposit accounts (primarily money market deposit accounts) and an increase in the average cost of repurchase agreements, among other things. See the analysis of net interest income included in the section captioned Net Interest Income elsewhere in this discussion. 
 Credit loss expense for 2022 totaled 3.0 million compared to 54 thousand in 2021. See the sections captioned Credit Loss Expense and Allowance for Credit Losses elsewhere in this discussion for further analysis of credit loss expense related to loans and off-balance-sheet commitments. 
 Non-interest income for 2022 increased 10.2 million, or 4.6 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily related to increases in service charges on deposit accounts; other charges commission and fees; and insurance commissions and fees partly offset by a decrease in other non-interest income. The increase in service charges on deposit accounts was primarily related to increases in overdraft charges on consumer and commercial accounts and consumer service charges. The increase in overdraft charges during 2022 was impacted by increases in the volume

 of fee assessed overdrafts relative to 2021, in part due to growth in the number of accounts. The increase in consumer service charges during 2022 was partly related to increases in overall deposit accounts and volumes. The increase in other charges commission and fees was primarily related to increases in merchant services rebates/bonuses and letter of credit fees, among other things. The increase in insurance commissions and fees was the result of an increase in commission income partly offset by a decrease in contingent income which is further discussed below in relation to Frost Insurance Agency. The decrease in other non-interest income was primarily related to a decrease gains on the sale/exchange of assets and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in income from customer derivative and securities trading transactions, among other things. These items were partly offset by increases in sundry and other miscellaneous income; public finance underwriting fees; and income from customer foreign exchange transactions, among other things. Gains on the sale/exchange of assets in 2021 included 9.7 million related to an exchange of a branch facility and 1.8 million related to the sale of certain parking lots in downtown San Antonio. Sundry and other miscellaneous income during 2022 included 6.3 million in card related incentives/rebates, 5.1 million related to a partnership interest, 1.4 million related to the recovery of prior write-offs and 458 thousand related to a contract fee, among other things, while sundry and other miscellaneous income during 2021 included 3.4 million in card related incentives/rebates and 519 thousand in recoveries of prior write-offs, among other things. The fluctuations in income from public finance underwriting fees; customer derivative and securities trading transactions and customer foreign exchange transactions were primarily related to fluctuations in transaction volumes. See the analysis of these categories of non-interest income included in the section captioned Non-Interest Income included elsewhere in this discussion. 
 Non-interest expense for 2022 increased 132.7 million, or 17.6 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and wages; other non-interest expense; technology, furniture and equipment expense; employee benefit expense; net occupancy expense and deposit insurance expense. The increase in salaries and wages was primarily related to an increase in in salaries due to annual merit and market increases as well as the implementation of a 20 per hour minimum wage in December, 2021. Salaries and wages were also impacted by an increase in the number of employees, increases in incentive and stock-based compensation and commissions and a decrease in salary costs deferred in connection with loan originations as the first quarter of 2021 was impacted by the high volume of PPP loan originations. The increase in other non-interest expense was primarily due to increases in professional services expense; advertising/promotions expense; travel, meals and entertainment; fraud losses; business development expense; sundry and other miscellaneous expense; and stationery, printing and supplies expense, among other things. Other non-interest expense during 2022 was also impacted by a decrease in costs deferred as loan origination costs as the first quarter of 2021 was impacted by a large volume of PPP loan originations. The impact of the aforementioned items was partly offset by a decrease in donations expense, which was impacted by 8.8 million in contributions to the Frost Charitable Foundation during 2021, among other things. The increase in technology, furniture and equipment expense was primarily related to increases in cloud services expense, service contracts expense, software maintenance and depreciation of furniture and equipment, among other things. The increase in employee benefit expense was primarily related to increases in payroll taxes, medical benefits expense, 401(k) plan expense and other employee benefits, among other things, partly offset by an increase in the net periodic benefits related to our defined benefit retirement plan. The increase in net occupancy expense was increases in repairs and maintenance/service contracts expense, lease expense, depreciation on buildings and leasehold improvements and insurance expense, among other things, partly offset by a decrease in property taxes. The increases in the aforementioned components of net occupancy expense were impacted, in part, by our expansion within the Houston and Dallas market areas. The increase in deposit insurance was primarily related to an increase in total assets. See the analysis of these categories of non-interest expense included in the section captioned Non-Interest Expense included elsewhere in this discussion. 
 Income tax expense for 2022 increased 43.6 million, or 105.2 , compared to 2021. See the section captioned Income Taxes elsewhere in this discussion. 
 Frost Insurance Agency, which is included in the Banking operating segment, had gross commission revenues of 54.2 million during 2022 compared to 52.5 million during 2021. The increase in gross commission revenues was the result of an increase in commission income partly offset by a decrease in contingent income. The increase in gross commission income was primarily related to increases in commercial and, to a lesser extent, personal lines property and casualty commissions, due to increases in business volumes and market rates. The increases in property and casualty commissions were partly offset by decreases in life insurance commissions and benefit plan commissions, primarily due to decreased business volume. The decrease in contingent income was primarily related to a decrease in performance related contingent payments due to low growth within the portfolio and a deterioration 
 47

 in the loss performance of insurance policies previously placed. This decrease was partly offset by an increase in contingent commissions received from various benefit plan insurance companies. See the analysis of insurance commissions and fees included in the section captioned Non-Interest Income included elsewhere in this discussion. 
 Frost Wealth Advisors 
 Net income for 2022 increased 1.5 million, or 4.1 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to an 8.4 million increase in non-interest income and a 2.5 million increase in net interest income partly offset by a 9.0 million increase in non-interest expense and a 401 thousand increase in income tax expense. 
 Net interest income for 2022 increased 2.5 million, or 117.3 , compared to 2021. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the average volume of funds provided by Frost Wealth Advisors and an increase in the average funds transfer price allocated to such funds. See the analysis of net interest income included in the section captioned Net Interest Income included elsewhere in this discussion. 
 Non-interest income for 2022 increased 8.4 million, or 5.0 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily related to increases in trust and investment management fees; other charges, commissions and fees; and other non-interest income. Trust and investment management fee income is the most significant income component for Frost Wealth Advisors. Investment management fees are the most significant component of trust and investment management fees, making up approximately 77.1 and 82.3 of total trust and investment management fees for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in trust and investment management fees was primarily due to increases in oil and gas fees, real estate fees and estate fees partly offset by a decrease in investment management fees. Oil and gas fees during 2022 were impacted by increases in oil and gas prices. The increases in real estate fees and estate fees were primarily related to increased transaction volumes and transaction fees. The decrease in investment management fees during 2022 was primarily related to lower average equity valuations, in part related to the sharp decline in equity valuations during 2022. The increase in other charges, commissions and fees was primarily related to an increase in income from the placement of money market accounts, among other things, partly offset by a decrease in income from the sale of mutual funds, among other things. The increase in other non-interest income was primarily related to an increase in income from customer securities trading transactions partly offset by a decrease in sundry and other miscellaneous income. See the analysis of trust and investment management fees and other charges, commissions and fees included in the section captioned Non-Interest Income included elsewhere in this discussion. 
 Non-interest expense for 2022 increased 9.0 million, or 7.3 , compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and wages and other non-interest expense, and to a lesser extent, increase in employee benefit expense and technology, furniture and equipment expense. The increase in salaries and wages was primarily due to increases in salaries, due to annual merit and market increases, as well as increases in commissions and incentive compensation. The increase in other non-interest expense was primarily due to an increase in sundry and other miscellaneous expense, which was primarily due to the write-off of certain assets; research and platform fees; and travel, meals and entertainment; among other things. The increase in employee benefits was primarily due to increases in 401(k) plan expense, medical expense and payroll taxes. The increase in technology, furniture and equipment expense was primarily due to an increase in cloud service expense. 
 Non-Banks 
 The Non-Banks operating segment had a net loss of 11.0 million for 2022 compared to a net loss of 9.0 million in 2021. The increased net loss was primarily due to an increase in net interest expense, a decrease in other non-interest income and an increase in other non-interest expense partly offset by an increase in income tax benefit. The increase in net interest expense was primarily related to an increase in the average rate paid on our long-term borrowings partly offset by the impact of the redemption, during the fourth quarter of 2021, of 13.4 million of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued to WNB Capital Trust I. The decrease in other non-interest income was primarily due to a decrease in mineral interest income as the related mineral interest assets were donated to the Frost Charitable Foundation during the third quarter of 2021. The increase in other non-interest expense was primarily due to an increase in travel, meals and entertainment expense, among other things.

 Income Taxes 
 We recognized income tax expense of 89.7 million, for an effective tax rate of 13.4 , in 2022 compared to 46.5 million, for an effective tax rate of 9.5 , in 2021. The effective income tax rates differed from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 21 during 2022 and 2021 primarily due to the effect of tax-exempt income from loans, securities and life insurance policies and the income tax effects associated with stock-based compensation, among other things, and their relative proportion to total pre-tax net income. The increase in the effective tax rate during 2022 was primarily related to an increase in pre-tax net income, and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in discrete tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. See Note 13 - Income Taxes in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report. 
 
 Sources and Uses of Funds 
 The following table illustrates, during the years presented, the mix of our funding sources and the assets in which those funds are invested as a percentage of our average total assets for the period indicated. Average assets totaled 51.5 billion in 2022 compared to 46.0 billion in 2021. 
 2022 2021 2020 Sources of Funds: Deposits: Non-interest-bearing 35.3 36.2 35.7 Interest-bearing 51.2 47.4 47.1 Federal funds purchased 0.1 0.1 0.1 Repurchase agreements 4.5 4.6 3.8 Long-term debt and other borrowings 0.4 0.5 0.9 Other non-interest-bearing liabilities 1.6 1.7 1.8 Equity capital 6.9 9.5 10.6 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 Uses of Funds: Loans 32.5 36.5 45.2 Securities 36.3 28.0 33.4 Interest-bearing deposits 24.8 29.4 14.0 Federal funds sold 0.1 0.2 Resell agreements 0.1 Other non-interest-earning assets 6.3 6.1 7.1 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 
 Deposits continue to be our primary source of funding. Average deposits increased 6.1 billion, or 15.9 , in 2022 compared to 2021. Non-interest-bearing deposits remain a significant source of funding, which has been a key factor in maintaining our relatively low cost of funds. Average non-interest-bearing deposits totaled 40.8 of total average deposits in 2022 compared to 43.3 in 2021. 
 We primarily invest funds in loans, securities and interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held by us in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve). Average loans decreased 30.9 million, or 0.2 , (increased 1.7 billion, or 11.3 excluding PPP loans) in 2022 compared to 2021 while average securities increased 5.8 billion, or 45.4 , in 2022 compared to 2021. Average interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held by us in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) decreased 746.8 million, or 5.5 , in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily related to the reinvestment of a portion of these funds into taxable securities. 
 
 Loans 
 Overview. Details of our loan portfolio are presented in Note 3 - Loans in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Year-end total loans increased 818.6 million, or 5.0 , during 2022 compared to 2021 1.2 billion, or 7.6 excluding PPP loans). The majority of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial loans, energy loans and real estate loans. Commercial and industrial loans made up 33.1 and 32.9 (33.1 and 33.7 excluding PPP loans) of total loans at December 31, 2022 and 2021 while energy loans made up 5.4 and 6.6 (5.4 and 6.8 excluding PPP loans) of total loans at both December 31, 2022 and 2021 and real estate loans made up 58.4 and 55.0 (58.6 and 56.5 excluding PPP loans) of total loans at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Energy loans include commercial and industrial loans, leases and real estate

 loans to borrowers in the energy industry. Real estate loans include both commercial and consumer balances. 
 Loan Origination/Risk Management. We have certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to maximize loan income within an acceptable level of risk. Management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis. A reporting system supplements the review process by providing management with frequent reports related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies and non-performing and potential problem loans. Diversification in the loan portfolio is a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions. We have begun to explore the credit and reputational risks associated with climate change and their potential impact on the foregoing and are also closely monitoring regulatory developments on climate risk. This includes, among other things, researching and developing a formalized approach to considering climate change related risks in our underwriting processes. This approach will be impacted, in part, by the accessibility and reliability of both customer climate risk data and climate risk data in general. One of the objectives of these efforts is to enable us to better understand the climate change related risks associated with our customers' business activities and to be able to monitor their response to those risks and their ultimate impact on our customers. 
 Commercial and industrial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower s ability to operate profitably and prudently expand its business. Underwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking. Once it is determined that the borrower s management possesses sound ethics and solid business acumen, our management examines current and projected cash flows to determine the ability of the borrower to repay their obligations as agreed. Commercial and industrial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of borrowers, however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial and industrial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and may incorporate a personal guarantee; however, some short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. 
 Our energy loan portfolio includes loans for production, energy services and other energy loans, which includes private clients, transportation and equipment providers, manufacturers, refiners and traders. The origination process for energy loans is similar to that of commercial and industrial loans. Because, however, of the average loan size, the significance of the portfolio and the specialized nature of the energy industry, our energy lending requires a highly prescriptive underwriting policy. Production loans are secured by proven, developed and producing reserves. Loan proceeds for these types of loans are typically used for the development and drilling of additional wells, the acquisition of additional production, and/or the acquisition of additional properties to be developed and drilled. Our customers in this sector are generally large, independent, private owner-producers or large corporate producers. These borrowers typically have large capital requirements for drilling and acquisitions, and as such, loans in this portfolio are generally greater than 10 million. Production loans are collateralized by the oil and gas interests of the borrower. Collateral values are determined by the risk-adjusted and limited discounted future net revenue of the reserves. Our valuations take into consideration geographic and reservoir differentials as well as cost structures associated with each borrower. Collateral value is calculated at least semi-annually using third-party engineer-prepared reserve studies. These reserve studies are conducted using a discount factor and base case assumptions for the current and future value of oil and gas. To qualify as collateral, typically reserves must be proven, developed and producing. For certain borrowers, collateral may include up to 20 proven, non-producing reserves. Loan commitments are limited to 65 of estimated reserve value. Cash flows must be sufficient to amortize the loan commitment within 120 of the half-life of the underlying reserves. Loan commitments generally must also be 100 covered by the risk-adjusted and limited discounted future net revenue of the reserves when stressed at 75 of our base case price assumptions. In addition, the ratio of the borrower's debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA should generally not exceed 350 . We generally require production borrowers to maintain an active hedging program to manage risk and to have at least 50 of their production hedged for two years. 
 Oil and gas service, transportation, and equipment providers are economically aligned due to their reliance on drilling and active oil and gas development. Income for these borrowers is highly dependent on the level of drilling activity and rig utilization, both of which are driven by the current and future outlook for the price of oil and gas. We mitigate the credit risk in this sector through conservative concentration limits and guidelines on the profile of eligible borrowers. Guidelines require that the companies have extensive experience through several industry cycles, and that they be supported by financially competent and committed guarantors who provide a significant secondary source of repayment. Borrowers in this sector are typically privately-owned, middle-market companies with annual 
 50

 sales of less than 100 million. The services provided by companies in this sector are highly diversified, and include down-hole testing and maintenance, providing and threading drilling pipe, hydraulic fracturing services or equipment, seismic testing and equipment and other direct or indirect providers to the oil and gas production sector. 
 We also have a small portfolio of loans to energy trading companies that serve as intermediaries that buy and sell oil, gas, other petrochemicals, and ethanol. These companies are not dependent on drilling or development. As a general policy, we do not lend to energy traders; however, we have made an exception to this policy for certain customers based upon their underlying business models which minimize risk as commodities are bought only to fill existing orders (back-to-back trading). As such, the commodity price risk and sale risk are eliminated. 
 PPP loans, which were originated in 2020 and early 2021, are loans to qualified small businesses under the PPP administered by the SBA under the provisions of the CARES Act. Loans covered by the PPP may be eligible for loan forgiveness for certain costs incurred related to payroll, group health care benefit costs and qualifying mortgage, rent and utility payments. The remaining loan balance after forgiveness of any amounts is still fully guaranteed by the SBA. Terms of the PPP loans include the following (i) maximum amount limited to the lesser of 10 million or an amount calculated using a payroll-based formula, (ii) maximum loan term of five years, (iii) interest rate of 1.00 , (iv) no collateral or personal guarantees are required, (v) no payments are required until the date on which the forgiveness amount relating to the loan is remitted to the lender and (vi) loan forgiveness up to the full principal amount of the loan and any accrued interest, subject to certain requirements including that no more than 40 of the loan forgiveness amount may be attributable to non-payroll costs. In return for processing and booking a PPP loan, the SBA paid lenders a processing fee tiered by the size of the loan (5 for loans of not more than 350 thousand; 3 for loans of more than 350 thousand and less than 2 million; and 1 for loans of at least 2 million). 
 Commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans, in addition to those of real estate loans. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of these loans is generally largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Commercial real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing our commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location. This diversity helps reduce our exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography and risk grade criteria. As a general rule, we avoid financing single-purpose projects unless other underwriting factors are present to help mitigate risk. We also utilize third-party experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting market areas we serve. In addition, management tracks the level of owner-occupied commercial real estate loans versus non-owner occupied loans. At December 31, 2022, approximately 49.6 of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate loans were secured by owner-occupied properties. 
 With respect to loans to developers and builders that are secured by non-owner occupied properties that we may originate from time to time, we generally require the borrower to have had an existing relationship with us and have a proven record of success. Construction loans are underwritten utilizing feasibility studies, independent appraisal reviews, sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates and financial analysis of the developers and property owners. Construction loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the completed project. These estimates may be inaccurate. Construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre-committed permanent loans from approved long-term lenders, sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from us until permanent financing is obtained. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, general economic conditions and the availability of long-term financing. 
 We originate consumer loans utilizing a credit scoring analysis to supplement the underwriting process. To monitor and manage consumer loan risk, policies and procedures are developed and modified, as needed, jointly by line and staff personnel. This activity, coupled with relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers, minimizes risk. Additionally, trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis. Underwriting standards for home equity loans are heavily influenced by statutory requirements, which include, but are not limited to, loan-to-value limitations, collection remedies, the number of such loans a borrower can have at one time and documentation requirements.

 We maintain an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis. Results of these reviews are presented to management and the appropriate committees of our board of directors. The loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel, as well as our policies and procedures. 
 Commercial and Industrial . Commercial and industrial loans increased 309.8 million, or 5.8 , during 2022 compared to 2021. Our commercial and industrial loans are a diverse group of loans to small, medium and large businesses. The purpose of these loans varies from supporting seasonal working capital needs to term financing of equipment. While some short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis, most are secured by the assets being financed with collateral margins that are consistent with our loan policy guidelines. The commercial and industrial loan portfolio also includes the commercial lease and purchased shared national credits. 
 Energy . Energy loans include loans to entities and individuals that are engaged in various energy-related activities including (i) the development and production of oil or natural gas, (ii) providing oil and gas field servicing, (iii) providing energy-related transportation services (iv) providing equipment to support oil and gas drilling (v) refining petrochemicals, or (vi) trading oil, gas and related commodities. Energy loans decreased 152.1 million, or 14.1 , during 2022 compared to 2021. The average loan size, the significance of the portfolio and the specialized nature of the energy industry requires a highly prescriptive underwriting policy. Exceptions to this policy are rarely granted. Due to the large borrowing requirements of this customer base, the energy loan portfolio includes participations and purchased shared national credits. 
 Paycheck Protection Program . PPP loans include loans to businesses and other entities that would otherwise be reported as commercial and industrial loans and, to a lesser extent, energy loans, originated under the guidelines discussed above. We funded approximately 1.4 billion and 3.3 billion of SBA-approved PPP loans during 2021 and 2020, respectively. During 2022 and 2021, we recognized approximately 2.6 million and 97.3 million in PPP loan related deferred processing fees (net of amortization of related deferred origination costs), respectively, as yield adjustments and these amounts are included in interest income on loans. As a result of the inclusion of these net fees in interest income, the average yields on PPP loans were 2.84 during 2022 and 6.26 during 2021, compared to the stated interest rate of 1.0 on these loans. 
 Industry Concentrations. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no concentrations of loans related to any single industry, as segregated by Standard Industrial Classification code SIC code ), in excess of 10 of total loans. The SIC code system is a federally designed standard industrial numbering system used by us to categorize loans by the borrower s type of business. The following table summarizes the industry concentrations of our loan portfolio, as segregated by SIC code, stated as a percentage of year-end total loans as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 2022 2021 Industry Concentrations Energy 5.4 6.6 Automobile dealers 5.4 4.1 Public finance 4.6 4.9 Medical services 3.9 3.7 Building materials and contractors 3.8 3.7 General and specific trade contractors 3.6 3.2 Manufacturing, other 3.4 2.8 Investor 2.8 2.7 Services 2.3 2.4 Religion 1.8 2.0 Paycheck Protection Program 0.2 2.6 All other 62.8 61.3 Total loans 100.0 100.0

 Large Credit Relationships. The market areas served by us include three of the top ten most populated cities in the United States. These market areas are also home to a significant number of Fortune 500 companies. As a result, we originate and maintain large credit relationships with numerous commercial customers in the ordinary course of business. We consider large credit relationships to be those with commitments equal to or in excess of 50.0 million, excluding treasury management lines exposure, prior to any portion being sold. Large relationships also include loan participations purchased if the credit relationship with the agent is equal to or in excess of 50.0 million. In addition to our normal policies and procedures related to the origination of large credits, one of our Regional Credit Committees must approve all new credit facilities and renewals of such credit facilities with exposures between 20.0 million and 30.0 million. Our Central Credit Committee must approve all new credit facilities which are part of large credit relationships and renewals of such credit facilities with exposures that exceed 30.0 million. The Regional and Central Credit Committees meet regularly to review large credit relationship activity and discuss the current pipeline, among other things. 
 The following table provides additional information on our large credit relationships with committed amounts in excess of 50.0 million as of year-end.

 Purchased Shared National Credits SNCs ). Purchased SNCs are participations purchased from upstream financial organizations and tend to be larger in size than our originated portfolio. Our purchased SNC portfolio totaled 790.5 million at December 31, 2022 increasing 92.1 million, or 13.2 , from 698.4 million at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, 32.8 of outstanding purchased SNCs were related to the construction industry, 22.7 were related to the energy industry, 11.9 were related to the financial services industry and 11.4 were related to the real estate management industry. The remaining purchased SNCs were diversified throughout various other industries, with no other single industry exceeding 10 of the total purchased SNC portfolio. Additionally, almost all of the outstanding balance of purchased SNCs was included in the energy and commercial and industrial portfolios, with the remainder included in the real estate categories. SNC participations are originated in the normal course of business to meet the needs of our customers. As a matter of policy, we generally only participate in SNCs for companies headquartered in or which have significant operations within our market areas. In addition, we must have direct access to the company s management, an existing banking relationship or the expectation of broadening the relationship with other banking products and services within the following 12 to 24 months. SNCs are reviewed at least quarterly for credit quality and business development successes. 
 The following table provides additional information about certain credits within our purchased SNCs portfolio with committed amounts in excess of 50.0 million as of year-end.

 Real Estate Loans. Real estate loans increased 1.0 billion, or 11.6 , during 2022 compared to 2021. Real estate loans include both commercial and consumer balances. Commercial real estate loans totaled 8.2 billion, or 81.6 of total real estate loans, at December 31, 2022 and 7.6 billion, or 84.3 of total real estate loans, at December 31, 2021. The majority of this portfolio consists of commercial real estate mortgages, which includes both permanent and intermediate term loans. Loans secured by owner-occupied properties make up a significant portion of our commercial real estate portfolio. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Consequently, these loans must undergo the analysis and underwriting process of a commercial and industrial loan, as well as that of a real estate loan.

 Consumer Loans . The consumer loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 increased 448.1 million, or 23.7 , from December 31, 2021. As the following table illustrates, the consumer loan portfolio has two distinct segments, including consumer real estate and consumer and other. 
 2022 2021 Consumer real estate: Home equity lines of credit 691,841 519,098 Home equity loans 449,507 324,157 Home improvement 577,377 428,069 Other 124,814 139,466 Total consumer real estate 1,843,539 1,410,790 Consumer and other 492,726 477,369 Total consumer loans 2,336,265 1,888,159 
 Consumer real estate loans at December 31, 2022 increased 432.7 million, or 30.7 , from December 31, 2021. Combined, home equity loans and lines of credit made up 61.9 and 59.8 of the consumer real estate loan total at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We offer home equity loans up to 80 of the estimated value of the personal residence of the borrower, less the value of existing mortgages and home improvement loans. We have not generally originated 1-4 family mortgage loans since 2000; however, from time to time, we invested in such loans to

 meet the needs of our customers or for other regulatory compliance purposes. Nonetheless, we expect to begin regular production of 1-4 family mortgage loans for portfolio investment purposes in 2023. The consumer and other loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 increased 15.4 million, or 3.2 , from December 31, 2021. This portfolio primarily consists of automobile loans, unsecured revolving credit products, personal loans secured by cash and cash equivalents, and other similar types of credit facilities. 
 Foreign Loans . We make U.S. dollar-denominated loans and commitments to borrowers in Mexico. The outstanding balance of these loans and the unfunded amounts available under these commitments were not significant at December 31, 2022 or 2021. 
 Maturities and Sensitivities of Loans to Changes in Interest Rates. The following table presents the maturity distribution of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2022. The table also presents the portion of loans that have fixed interest rates or variable interest rates that fluctuate over the life of the loans in accordance with changes in an interest rate index.

 We generally structure commercial loans with shorter-term maturities in order to match our funding sources and to enable us to effectively manage the loan portfolio by providing the flexibility to respond to liquidity needs, changes in interest rates and changes in underwriting standards and loan structures, among other things. Due to the shorter-term nature of such loans, from time to time in the ordinary course of business and without any contractual obligation on our part, we will renew/extend maturing lines of credit or refinance existing loans at their maturity dates. Some loans may renew multiple times in a given year as a result of general customer practice and need. These renewals, extensions and refinancings are made in the ordinary course of business for customers that meet our normal level of credit standards. Such borrowers typically request renewals to support their on-going working capital needs to finance their operations. Such borrowers are not experiencing financial difficulties and generally 
 55 

Table of Contents 

 could obtain similar financing from another financial institution. In connection with each renewal, extension or refinancing, we may require a principal reduction, adjust the rate of interest and/or modify the structure and other terms to reflect the current market pricing/structuring for such loans or to maintain competitiveness with other financial institutions. In such cases, we do not generally grant concessions, and, except for those reported in Note 3 - Loans, any such renewals, extensions or refinancings that occurred during the reported periods were not deemed to be troubled debt restructurings pursuant to applicable accounting guidance. Loans exceeding 1.0 million undergo a complete underwriting process at each renewal.

 Accruing past due loans at December 31, 2022 decreased 18.9 million compared to December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in past due non-construction related commercial real estate loans (down 16.5 million), past due PPP loans (down 4.6 million) and past due commercial and industrial loans (down 1.0 million) partly offset by an increase in past due consumer real estate loans (up 3.2 million). PPP loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA and we expect to collect all amounts due related to these loans. Excluding PPP loans, accruing past due loans decreased 14.3 million.

 Non-accrual loans at December 31, 2022 decreased 15.9 million from December 31, 2021 primarily due to decreases in non-accrual commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans. The decreases were primarily related to principal payments, loans returning to accrual status and charge-offs. 
 Generally, loans are placed on non-accrual status if principal or interest payments become 90 days past due and/or management deems the collectibility of the principal and/or interest to be in question, as well as when required by regulatory requirements. Once interest accruals are discontinued, accrued but uncollected interest is charged to current year operations. Subsequent receipts on non-accrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal, and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured. Classification of a loan as non-accrual does not preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal or interest. There were no non-accrual commercial and industrial loans in excess of 5.0 million at December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021. Non-accrual energy loans included two credit relationship in excess of 5 million totaling 11.1 million at December 31, 2022. One of these relationships was previously reported as non-accrual with an aggregate balance of 9.6 million at December 31, 2021. The aggregate balance of this credit relationship decreased 3.6 million in 2022 as a result of principal payments made by the borrower. Non-accrual real estate loans primarily consist of land development, 1-4 family residential construction credit relationships and loans secured by office buildings and religious facilities. There were no non-accrual commercial real estate loans in excess of 5.0 million at December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021. 
 
 Allowance For Credit Losses 
 As discussed in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements, our policies and procedures related to accounting for credit losses changed on January 1, 2020 in connection with the adoption of a new accounting standard update as codified in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 326 ASC 326 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. In the case of off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of each allowance account represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses CECL on these financial instruments considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant factors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information

 available, the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets. For additional information regarding our accounting policies related to credit losses, refer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 - Loans in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans. The table below provides an allocation of the year-end allowance for credit losses on loans by loan portfolio segment; however, allocation of a portion of the allowance to one segment does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other segments. 
 Amount of Allowance Allocated Percent of Loans in Each Category to Total Loans Total Loans Ratio of Allowance Allocated to Loans in Each Category December 31, 2022 Commercial and industrial 104,237 33.1 5,674,798 1.84 Energy 18,062 5.4 925,729 1.95 Paycheck Protection Program 0.2 34,852 Commercial real estate 90,301 47.7 8,183,325 1.10 Consumer real estate 8,004 10.7 1,843,539 0.43 Consumer and other 7,017 2.9 492,726 1.42 Total 227,621 100.0 17,154,969 1.33 Excluding PPP loans 227,621 17,120,117 1.33 December 31, 2021 Commercial and industrial 72,091 32.9 5,364,954 1.34 Energy 17,217 6.6 1,077,792 1.60 Paycheck Protection Program 2.6 428,882 Commercial real estate 144,936 46.4 7,576,610 1.91 Consumer real estate 6,585 8.6 1,410,790 0.47 Consumer and other 7,837 2.9 477,369 1.64 Total 248,666 100.0 16,336,397 1.52 Excluding PPP loans 248,666 15,907,515 1.56 
 The allowance allocated to commercial and industrial loans totaled 104.2 million, or 1.84 of total commercial and industrial loans, at December 31, 2022 increasing 32.1 million, or 44.6 , compared to 72.1 million, or 1.34 of total commercial and industrial loans at December 31, 2021. Modeled expected credit losses increased 15.0 million while qualitative factor Q-Factor and other qualitative adjustments related to commercial and industrial loans increased 21.6 million. Specific allocations for commercial and industrial loans that were evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis decreased 4.5 million, or 42.3 , from 10.5 million at December 31, 2021 to 6.1 million at December 31, 2022. The decrease in specific allocations for commercial and industrial loans was primarily related to principal payments received and the recognition of charge-offs. 
 The allowance allocated to energy loans totaled 18.1 million, or 1.95 of total energy loans, at December 31, 2022 decreasing 845 thousand, or 4.9 , compared to 17.2 million, or 1.60 of total energy loans at December 31, 2021. Modeled expected credit losses related to energy loans increased 2.2 million while Q-Factor and other qualitative adjustments related to energy loans decreased 226 thousand. Specific allocations for energy loans that were evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis totaled 4.4 million at December 31, 2022 decreasing 1.1 million, or 20.0 , compared to 5.5 million at December 31, 2021. 
 The allowance allocated to commercial real estate loans totaled 90.3 million, or 1.10 of total commercial real estate loans, at December 31, 2022 decreasing 54.6 million, or 37.7 , compared to 144.9 million, or 1.91 of total commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2021. Modeled expected credit losses related to commercial real estate loans increased 10.3 million while Q-Factor and other qualitative adjustments related to commercial real estate loans decreased 66.3 million.

 The allowance allocated to consumer real estate loans totaled 8.0 million, or 0.43 of total consumer real estate loans, at December 31, 2022 increasing 1.4 million, or 21.5 , compared to 6.6 million, or 0.47 of total consumer real estate loans at December 31, 2021 primarily due to modeled expected credit losses which increased 1.4 million. 
 The allowance allocated to consumer loans totaled 7.0 million, or 1.42 of total consumer loans, at December 31, 2022 decreasing 820 thousand, or 10.5 , compared to 7.8 million, or 1.64 of total consumer loans at December 31, 2021. Modeled expected credit losses related to consumer loans decreased 1.4 million while Q-Factor and other qualitative adjustments related to consumer loans increased 594 thousand. 
 As more fully described in Note 3 - Loans in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we measure expected credit losses over the life of each loan utilizing a combination of models which measure probability of default and loss given default, among other things. The measurement of expected credit losses is impacted by loan/borrower attributes and certain macroeconomic variables. Models are adjusted to reflect the current impact of certain macroeconomic variables as well as their expected changes over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. 
 In estimating expected credit losses as of December 31, 2022, we utilized the Moody s Analytics December 2022 Baseline Scenario (the December 2022 Baseline Scenario to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in our models. The December 2022 Baseline Scenario was based on the review of a variety of surveys of baseline forecasts of the U.S. economy. The December 2022 Baseline Scenario projections included, among other things, (i) U.S. Nominal Gross Domestic Product annualized quarterly growth rate of 2.65 in the first quarter of 2023, followed by annualized quarterly growth rates in the range of 3.62 to 4.50 during the remainder of 2023 and an average annualized growth rate of 4.79 through the end of the forecast period in the fourth quarter of 2024; (ii) U.S. unemployment rate of 3.80 in the first quarter of 2023 and an average quarterly U.S. unemployment rate of 4.06 through the end of the forecast period in the fourth quarter of 2024; (iii) Texas unemployment rate of 4.10 in the first quarter of 2023 and an average quarterly Texas unemployment rate of 4.04 through the end of the forecast period in the fourth quarter of 2024; (iv) projected average 10 year Treasury rate of 4.03 in the first quarter of 2023 and average projected rates of 4.25 during the remainder of 2023 and 3.96 in 2024; and (v) average oil price of 93 per barrel in the first quarter of 2023 decreasing to 67 per barrel by the end of the forecast period in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 In estimating expected credit losses as of December 31, 2021, we utilized the Moody s Analytics December 2021 Consensus Scenario (the December 2021 Consensus Scenario to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in our models. The December 2021 Consensus Scenario was based on the review of a variety of surveys of baseline forecasts of the U.S. economy. The December 2021 Consensus Scenario projections included, among other things, (i) U.S. Nominal Gross Domestic Product annualized quarterly growth rate of 6.40 in the first quarter of 2022, followed by annualized quarterly growth rates in the range of 3.83 to 5.35 during the remainder of 2022 and an average annualized growth rate of 4.76 through the end of the forecast period in the fourth quarter of 2023; (ii) U.S. unemployment rate of 4.33 in the first quarter of 2022 improving to 3.69 by the end of the forecast period in the fourth quarter of 2023 with Texas unemployment rates slightly higher at those dates; (iii) projected average 10 year Treasury rate of 1.59 in the first quarter of 2022, increasing to average projected rates of 1.75 during the remainder of 2022 and 2.10 in 2023; and (iv) average oil price in the range of approximately 62 to 66 per barrel through the end of the forecast period in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 The overall loan portfolio, excluding PPP loans which are fully guaranteed by the SBA, as of December 31, 2022 increased 1.2 billion, or 7.6 , compared to December 31, 2021. This increase included a 606.7 million, or 8.0 , increase in commercial real estate loans, a 309.8 million, or 5.8 , increase in commercial and industrial loans and a 432.7 million, or 30.7 , increase in consumer real estate loans and a 15.4 million, or 3.2 , increase in consumer and other loans partly offset by a 152.1 million, or 14.1 , decrease in energy loans. The weighted average risk grade for commercial and industrial loans increased to 6.39 at December 31, 2022 compared to 6.22 at December 31, 2021. Commercial and industrial loans graded watch and special mention (risk grades 9 and 10) decreased 63.2 million during 2022 while classified commercial and industrial loans increased 993 thousand. Classified loans consist of loans having a risk grade of 11, 12 or 13. The weighted-average risk grade for energy loans decreased to 5.67 at December 31, 2022 from 6.06 at December 31, 2021. The decrease in the weighted average risk grade was impacted by a decrease in the weighted-average risk grade of pass grade energy loans from 5.78 at December 31, 2021 to 5.44 at December 31, 2022. Additionally, energy loans graded watch and special mention (risk grades 9 and 10) decreased 26.6 million while classified energy loans decreased 4.2 million. The weighted average risk grade for commercial real estate loans decreased from 7.19 at December 31, 2021 to 7.10 at

 December 31, 2022. Pass grade commercial real estate loans increased 932.9 million while commercial real estate loans graded as watch and special mention decreased 315.3 million and classified commercial real estate loans decreased 10.9 million. 
 As noted above our credit loss models utilized the economic forecasts in the Moody s Baseline Scenario for December 2022 for our estimated expected credit losses as of December 31, 2022 and the Moody s Consensus Scenario for December 2021 for our estimate of expected credit losses as of December 31, 2021. We qualitatively adjusted the model results based on these scenarios for various risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools. These Q-Factor and other qualitative adjustments are discussed below. 
 Q-Factor adjustments are based upon management judgment and current assessment as to the impact of risks related to changes in lending policies and procedures; economic and business conditions; loan portfolio attributes and credit concentrations; and external factors, among other things, that are not already captured within the modeling inputs, assumptions and other processes. Management assesses the potential impact of such items within a range of severely negative impact to positive impact and adjusts the modeled expected credit loss by an aggregate adjustment percentage based upon the assessment. As a result of this assessment as of December 31, 2022, modeled expected credit losses were adjusted upwards by a weighted-average Q-Factor adjustment of approximately 2.2 , resulting in a 2.3 million total adjustment, up from approximately 2.3 at December 31, 2021, which resulted in a 1.8 million total adjustment. The weighted-average Q-Factor adjustment at December 31, 2022 was based on a limited negative expected impact on our non-owner occupied and construction commercial real estate loan portfolios related to changes in loan portfolio concentrations (no expected impact related to our commercial and industrial portfolio); a limited negative expected impact on all of our loan portfolios related to changes in the volumes and severity of loan delinquencies, changes in risk grades and adverse classifications; a limited negative expected impact on our commercial and consumer real estate portfolios related to the potential deterioration of collateral values (no expected impact related to our commercial and industrial and consumer portfolios); a negative expected impact associated with national, regional and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of loans; a severely negative expected impact from other risk factors associated with our commercial real estate construction and land loan portfolios, particularly the risks related to expected extensions; and limited negative impact to our commercial real estate construction and non-owner occupied loan portfolios, as well as a negative impact to our consumer loan portfolio related to changes in lending policies, procedures, underwriting standards and loan portfolio attributes, among other things. The weighted-average Q-Factor adjustment at December 31, 2021 was based on a limited negative expected impact on our commercial loan portfolios related to changes in lending policies procedures and underwriting standards and changes in loan portfolio concentrations; a negative expected impact associated with national, regional and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of loans; a severely negative expected impact from other risk factors associated with our commercial real estate construction and land loan portfolios, particularly the risks related to expected extensions; and no impact to changes in loan portfolio attributes, changes in risk grades, changes in the volumes and severity of loan delinquencies and adverse classifications and potential deterioration of collateral values. 
 We have also provided additional qualitative adjustments, or management overlays, as of December 31, 2022 as management believes there are still significant risks impacting certain categories of our loan portfolio. Q-Factor and other qualitative adjustments as of December 31, 2022 are detailed in the table below.

 Model overlays are qualitative adjustments to address the effect of risks not captured within our commercial real estate credit loss models. These adjustments are determined based upon minimum reserve ratios for our commercial real estate - owner occupied, commercial real estate - non-owner occupied and commercial real estate - construction loan portfolios. 
 Office building overlays are qualitative adjustments to address longer-term concerns over the utilization of commercial office space which could impact the long-term performance and collateral valuations of some types of office properties within our commercial real estate loan portfolio. These adjustments are determined based upon minimum reserve ratios for loans within our commercial real estate - non-owner occupied and commercial real estate - construction loan portfolios that have risk grades of 8 or worse. 
 The down-side scenario overlay is a qualitative adjustment for our commercial and industrial loan portfolio to address the significant risk of economic recession as a result of inflation; rising interest rates; labor shortages; disruption in financial markets and global supply chains; further oil price volatility; and the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including the current war between Russia and Ukraine, terrorism or other geopolitical events. Factors such as these are outside of our control but nonetheless affect customer income levels and could alter anticipated customer behavior, including borrowing, repayment, investment and deposit practices. To determine this qualitative adjustment, we use an alternative, more pessimistic economic scenario to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in our models. As of December 31, 2022, we used the Moody s Analytics November 2022 S3 Alternative Scenario Downside - 90th Percentile (the November 2022 S3 Scenario ). In modeling expected credit losses using this scenario, we also assume each loan within our modeled loan pools is downgraded by one risk grade level. The qualitative adjustment is based upon the amount by which the alternative scenario modeling results exceed those of the primary scenario used in estimating credit loss expense, adjusted based upon management's assessment of the probability that this more pessimistic economic scenario will occur. 
 Credit concentration overlays are qualitative adjustments based upon statistical analysis to address relationship exposure concentrations within our loan portfolio. Variations in loan portfolio concentrations over time cause expected credit losses within our existing portfolio to differ from historical loss experience. Given that the allowance for credit losses on loans reflects expected credit losses within our loan portfolio and the fact that these expected credit losses are uncertain as to nature, timing and amount, management believes that segments with higher concentration risk are more likely to experience a high loss event. Due to the fact that a significant portion of our loan portfolio is concentrated in large credit relationships and because of large, concentrated credit losses in recent years, management made the qualitative adjustments detailed in the table above to address the risk associated with such a relationship deteriorating to a loss event. 
 The consumer overlay is a qualitative adjustment for our consumer and other loan portfolio to address the risk associated with the level of unsecured loans within this portfolio and other risk factors. Unsecured consumer loans have an elevated risk of loss in times of economic stress as these loans lack a secondary source of repayment in the form of hard collateral. This adjustment was determined by analyzing our consumer loan charge-off trends as well as those of the general banking industry. Management deemed it appropriate to consider an additional overlay to the modeled forecasted losses for the unsecured consumer portfolio.

Net credit loss expense/benefit for each portfolio segment reflects the amount needed to adjust the allowance for credit losses allocated to that segment to the level of expected credit losses determined under our allowance methodology after net charge-offs have been recognized. 
 The net credit loss benefit related to loans during 2022 primarily reflects a decrease in expected credit losses associated with commercial real estate loans, primarily related to a decrease in expected credit losses related to certain pandemic impacted industries and a reduction in the minimum reserve ratio for our commercial real estate - owner occupied portfolio. The impact of this decrease was partly offset by an increase in expected credit losses associated with commercial and industrial loans, primarily related to the down-side scenario overlay discussed above, and increases in modeled losses for our commercial and industrial, energy, commercial real estate and consumer real estate portfolios. The net credit loss benefit related to loans during 2021 primarily reflects improvements in forecasted economic conditions and oil price trends relative to the prevailing conditions in 2020 as well as a decrease in net charge-offs. Credit loss expense related to loans during 2020 reflected the uncertain future impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant volatility in oil prices as well as the level of net charge-offs, the expected deterioration in credit quality and other changes within the loan portfolio. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans was 1.33 (also 1.33 excluding PPP loans) at December 31, 2022 compared to 1.52 (1.56 excluding PPP loans) at December 31, 2021. Management believes the recorded amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans is appropriate based upon management s best estimate of current expected credit losses within the existing portfolio of loans. Should any of the factors considered by management in making this estimate change, our estimate of current expect credit losses could also change, which could affect the level of future credit loss expense related to loans. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses - Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures totaled 58.6 million and 50.3 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The level of the allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures depends upon the volume of outstanding commitments, underlying risk grades, the expected utilization of available funds and forecasted economic conditions impacting our loan portfolio. Credit loss expense related to off-balance-sheet credit exposures totaled 8.3 million during 2022 compared to 6.2 million during 2021 and 4.3 million during 2020. The increase in credit loss expense during the comparable periods primarily reflects increases in overall off-balance-sheet credit exposures. Credit loss expense for off-balance-sheet credit exposures in 2021 was also partly impacted by the down-grade of a large credit commitment within our SNC portfolio. Further information regarding our policies and methodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures is presented in Note 8 - Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements, Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.

 Securities 
 The following tables summarize the maturity distribution schedule with corresponding weighted-average yields of securities held to maturity and securities available for sale as of December 31, 2022. Weighted-average yields have been computed on a fully taxable-equivalent basis using a tax rate of 21 . Mortgage-backed securities are included in maturity categories based on their stated maturity date. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations. Other securities classified as available for sale include stock in the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Home Loan Bank, which have no maturity date. These securities have been included in the total column only. Held-to-maturity securities are presented at amortized cost before any allowance for credit losses.

 All mortgage-backed securities included in the above tables were issued by U.S. government agencies and corporations. At December 31, 2022, all of the securities in our municipal bond portfolio were issued by the State of Texas or political subdivisions or agencies within the State of Texas, of which approximately 75.6 are either guaranteed by the Texas Permanent School Fund, which has a triple-A insurer financial strength rating, or secured by U.S. Treasury securities via defeasance of the debt by the issuers. 
 The average taxable-equivalent yield on the securities portfolio based on a 21 tax rate was 2.95 in 2022 compared to 3.29 in 2021. Tax-exempt municipal securities totaled 42.7 of average securities in 2022 compared to 64.2 in 2021. The average yield on taxable securities was 2.16 in 2022 compared to 1.97 in 2021, while the average taxable-equivalent yield on tax-exempt securities was 4.08 in 2022 compared to 4.06 in 2021. See the section captioned Net Interest Income elsewhere in this discussion. 
 
 Deposits 
 The table below presents the daily average balances of deposits by type and weighted-average rates paid thereon during the years presented: 
 2022 2021 2020 Average Balance Average Rate Paid Average Balance Average Rate Paid Average Balance Average Rate Paid Non-interest-bearing demand deposits 18,202,669 16,670,807 13,563,696 Interest-bearing deposits: Savings and interest checking 12,160,482 0.10 10,682,149 0.01 8,283,665 0.03 Money market accounts 12,727,533 0.90 9,990,626 0.09 8,457,263 0.18 Time accounts 1,480,088 0.92 1,129,041 0.33 1,133,648 1.25 Total interest-bearing deposits 26,368,103 0.53 21,801,816 0.07 17,874,576 0.18 Total deposits 44,570,772 0.32 38,472,623 0.04 31,438,272 0.10 
 Average deposits increased 6.1 billion, or 15.9 , in 2022 compared to 2021. The most significant volume growth during 2022 compared to 2021 was in money market deposits; non-interest bearing deposits; and savings and interest checking deposits. The ratio of average interest-bearing deposits to total average deposits was 59.2 in 2022 
 64 

Table of Contents 

 compared to 56.7 in 2021. The average rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and total deposits were 0.53 and 0.32 , respectively, during 2022 compared to 0.07 and 0.04 , respectively, during 2021. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits during 2022 was impacted by an increase in the interest rates we pay on most of our interest-bearing deposit products as a result of increases in market interest rates. 
 Geographic Concentrations . The following table summarizes our average total deposit portfolio, as segregated by the geographic region from which the deposit accounts were originated. Certain accounts, such as correspondent bank deposits and deposits allocated to certain statewide operational units, are recorded at the statewide level. 
 Percent Percent Percent 2022 of Total 2021 of Total 2020 of Total San Antonio 13,402,978 30.1 11,140,600 29.0 9,147,078 29.1 Houston 8,317,538 18.7 7,360,930 19.1 5,715,514 18.2 Fort Worth 7,498,616 16.8 6,650,164 17.3 5,615,584 17.9 Austin 5,752,901 12.9 4,931,275 12.8 3,882,661 12.3 Dallas 3,678,111 8.3 3,181,252 8.3 2,553,571 8.1 Corpus Christi 2,152,544 4.8 1,965,158 5.1 1,655,395 5.3 Permian Basin 2,043,713 4.6 1,694,366 4.4 1,518,781 4.8 Rio Grande Valley 1,198,377 2.7 1,055,427 2.7 895,653 2.8 Statewide 525,994 1.1 493,451 1.3 454,035 1.5 Total 44,570,772 100.0 38,472,623 100.0 31,438,272 100.0 
 Foreign Deposits. Mexico has historically been considered a part of the natural trade territory of our banking offices. Accordingly, U.S. dollar-denominated foreign deposits from sources within Mexico have traditionally been a significant source of funding. Average deposits from foreign sources, primarily Mexico, totaled 1.1 billion in 2022 and 933.3 million in 2021. 
 Brokered Deposits. From time to time, we have obtained interest-bearing deposits through brokered transactions including participation in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service CDARS ). Brokered deposits were not significant during the reported periods. 
 
 Capital and Liquidity 
 Capital . Shareholders equity totaled 3.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and 4.4 billion at December 31, 2021. In addition to net income of 579.2 million, other sources of capital during 2022 included 16.7 million in proceeds from stock option exercises and 18.3 million related to stock-based compensation. Uses of capital during 2022 included an other comprehensive loss, net of tax, of 1.7 billion, 216.5 million of dividends paid on preferred and common stock and 4.4 million of treasury stock purchases. 
 The accumulated other comprehensive income/loss component of shareholders equity totaled a net, after-tax, unrealized loss of 1.3 billion at December 31, 2022 compared to a net, after-tax, unrealized gain of 347.3 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a 1.7 billion net, after-tax, decrease in the fair value of securities available for sale. 
 Under the Basel III Capital Rules, we elected to opt-out of the requirement to include most components of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital. Accordingly, amounts reported as accumulated other comprehensive income/loss related to securities available for sale, effective cash flow hedges and defined benefit post-retirement benefit plans do not increase or reduce regulatory capital and are not included in the calculation of risk-based capital and leverage ratios. In connection with the adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, we also elected to exclude, for a transitional period, the effects of credit loss accounting under CECL in the calculation of our regulatory capital and regulatory capital ratios. Regulatory agencies for banks and bank holding companies utilize capital guidelines designed to measure capital and take into consideration the risk inherent in both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. See Note 9 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report. 
 We paid quarterly dividends of 0.75, 0.75, 0.87 and 0.87 per common share during the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2022, respectively, and quarterly dividends of 0.72, 0.72, 0.75 and 0.75 per common share during the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2021, respectively. This equates to a dividend payout ratio 
 65 

Table of Contents 

 of 36.6 in 2022 and 43.3 in 2021. The amount of dividend, if any, we may pay may be limited as more fully discussed in Note 9 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report. 
 Preferred Stock . On March 16, 2020, we redeemed all 6,000,000 shares of our 5.375 Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, Series A Preferred Stock at a redemption price of 25 per share, or an aggregate redemption of 150.0 million. On November 19, 2020 we issued 150,000 shares, or 150.0 million in aggregate liquidation preference, of our 4.450 Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, par value 0.01 and liquidation preference 1,000 per share Series B Preferred Stock ). Each share of Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding is represented by 40 depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of the Series B Preferred Stock (equivalent to a liquidation preference of 25 per share). Additional details about our preferred stock are included in Note 9 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report. 
 Stock Repurchase Plans. From time to time, our board of directors has authorized stock repurchase plans. In general, stock repurchase plans allow us to proactively manage our capital position and return excess capital to shareholders. Shares purchased under such plans also provide us with shares of common stock necessary to satisfy obligations related to stock compensation awards. On January 25, 2023, our board of directors authorized a 100.0 million stock repurchase plan, allowing us to repurchase shares of our common stock over a one-year period from time to time at various prices in the open market or through private transactions. No shares were repurchased under a stock repurchase plan during 2022 or 2021. Under a prior stock repurchase plan, we repurchased 177,834 shares at a total cost of 13.7 million during 2020. 
 Liquidity . Liquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due. The liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan requests, to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities. The ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of its balance sheet structure, its ability to liquidate assets and its access to alternative sources of funds. The objective of our liquidity management is to manage cash flow and liquidity reserves so that they are adequate to fund our operations and to meet obligations and other commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. We seek to achieve this objective and ensure that funding needs are met by maintaining an appropriate level of liquid funds through asset/liability management, which includes managing the mix and time to maturity of financial assets and financial liabilities on our balance sheet. Our liquidity position is enhanced by our ability to raise additional funds as needed in the wholesale markets. 
 Asset liquidity is provided by liquid assets which are readily marketable or pledgeable or which will mature in the near future. Liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits in banks, securities available for sale, maturities and cash flow from securities held to maturity, and federal funds sold and resell agreements. Liability liquidity is provided by access to funding sources which include core deposits and correspondent banks in our natural trade area that maintain accounts with and sell federal funds to Frost Bank, as well as federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements from upstream banks and deposits obtained through financial intermediaries. 
 Our liquidity position is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate. Liquidity risk management is an important element in our asset/liability management process. We regularly model liquidity stress scenarios to assess potential liquidity outflows or funding problems resulting from economic disruptions, volatility in the financial markets, unexpected credit events or other significant occurrences deemed problematic by management. These scenarios are incorporated into our contingency funding plan, which provides the basis for the identification of our liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 11.1 billion held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve. We also have the ability to borrow funds as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB ). As of December 31, 2022, based upon available, pledgeable collateral, our total borrowing capacity with the FHLB was approximately 3.4 billion. Furthermore, at December 31, 2022, we had approximately 12.7 billion in securities that were unencumbered by a pledge and could be used to support additional borrowings through repurchase agreements or the Federal Reserve discount window, as needed. As of December 31, 2022, management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources or operations. In addition, management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity that would have a material adverse effect on us. 
 In the ordinary course of business we have entered into contractual obligations and have made other commitments to make future payments. Refer to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for the expected timing of such payments as of December 31, 2022. These include payments related to

 (i) long-term borrowings (Note 7 - Borrowed Funds), (ii) operating leases (Note 4 - Premises and Equipment and Lease Commitments), (iii) time deposits with stated maturity dates (Note 6 - Deposits) and (iv) commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit (Note 8 - Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements, Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies). 
 Since Cullen/Frost is a holding company and does not conduct operations, its primary sources of liquidity are dividends upstreamed from Frost Bank and borrowings from outside sources. Banking regulations may limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by Frost Bank. See Note 9 - Capital and Regulatory Matters in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report regarding such dividends. At December 31, 2022, Cullen/Frost had liquid assets, including cash and resell agreements, totaling 311.9 million. 
 
 Regulatory and Economic Policies 
 Our business and earnings are affected by general and local economic conditions and by the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government, its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities, among other things. The Federal Reserve Board regulates the supply of money in order to influence general economic conditions. Among the instruments of monetary policy historically available to the Federal Reserve Board are (i) conducting open market operations in United States government obligations, (ii) changing the discount rate on financial institution borrowings, (iii) imposing or changing reserve requirements against financial institution deposits, and (iv) restricting certain borrowings and imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by financial institutions and their affiliates. These methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to affect directly the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. For that reason alone, the policies of the Federal Reserve Board have a material effect on our earnings. 
 Governmental policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future; however, we cannot accurately predict the nature, timing or extent of any effect such policies may have on our future business and earnings. 
 
 Accounting Standards Updates 
 See Note 20 - Accounting Standards Updates in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for details of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our financial statements. 

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 The disclosures set forth in this item are qualified by Item 1A. Risk Factors and the section captioned Forward-Looking Statements and Factors that Could Affect Future Results included in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report, and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in this report. 
 Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and other relevant market rates and prices, such as equity prices. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows, and future earnings. Due to the nature of our operations, we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk and, to a lesser extent, liquidity risk. 
 Interest rate risk on our balance sheets consists of reprice, option, and basis risks. Reprice risk results from differences in the maturity, or repricing, of asset and liability portfolios. Option risk arises from embedded options present in many financial instruments such as loan prepayment options, deposit early withdrawal options and interest rate options. These options allow customers opportunities to benefit when market interest rates change, which typically results in higher costs or lower revenue for us. Basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates and indices, which subsequently result in a narrowing of the profit spread on an earning asset or liability. Basis risk is also present in administered rate liabilities, such as savings accounts, negotiable order of withdrawal accounts, and money market accounts where historical pricing relationships to market rates may change due to the level or directional change in market interest rates. 
 We seek to avoid fluctuations in our net interest margin and to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of risk through periods of changing interest rates. Accordingly, our interest rate sensitivity and liquidity are monitored on an ongoing basis by our Asset and Liability Committee ALCO ), which oversees market risk 
 67 

Table of Contents 

 management and establishes risk measures, limits and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital. A variety of measures are used to provide for a comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk, the distribution of risk, the level of risk over time and the exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships. 
 We utilize an earnings simulation model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk associated with changing market rates. The model quantifies the effects of various interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income and net income over the next 12 months. The model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a flat-rate case scenario of hypothetical fluctuations in interest rates over the next 12 months. These simulations incorporate assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and mix, pricing and the repricing and maturity characteristics of the existing and projected balance sheet. The impact of interest rate derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, caps and floors, is also included in the model. Other interest rate-related risks such as prepayment, basis and option risk are also considered. 
 ALCO continuously monitors and manages the balance between interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities. The objective is to manage the impact of fluctuating market rates on net interest income within acceptable levels. In order to meet this objective, management may lengthen or shorten the duration of assets or liabilities or enter into derivative contracts to mitigate potential market risk. 
 For modeling purposes, as of December 31, 2022, the model simulations projected that 100 and 200 basis point ratable increases in interest rates would result in positive variances in net interest income of 0.2 and 1.4 , respectively, relative to the flat-rate case over the next 12 months, while 100 and 200 basis point ratable decreases in interest rates would result in a negative variance in net interest income of 0.2 and 1.4 , respectively, relative to the flat-rate case over the next 12 months. For modeling purposes, as of December 31, 2021, the model simulations projected that 100 and 200 basis point ratable increases in interest rates would result in positive variances in net interest income of 2.8 and 7.1 , respectively, relative to the flat-rate case over the next 12 months, while a 25 basis point ratable decrease in interest rates would result in a negative variance in net interest income of 3.0 relative to the flat-rate case over the next 12 months. The likelihood of a decrease in interest rates beyond 25 basis points as of December 31, 2021 was considered to be remote given prevailing interest rate levels. 
 We do not currently pay interest on a significant portion of our commercial demand deposits. Any interest rate that would ultimately be paid on these commercial demand deposits would likely depend upon a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our December 31, 2022 model simulations do not assume any payment of interest on commercial demand deposits (those not already receiving an earnings credit) while our modeling simulations as of December 31, 2021 assumed we would make interest payments on commercial demand deposits (those not already receiving an earnings credit) with such payments assumed to begin in the first quarter of 2022. This pricing structure on commercial demand deposits assumed a deposit pricing beta of 25 . The pricing beta is a measure of how much deposit rates reprice, up or down, given a defined change in market rates. As of December 31, 2022, management believes, based on our experience during the last interest rate cycle, that it is less likely we will pay interest on these deposits as rates increase. 
 The model simulations as of December 31, 2022 indicate that our projected balance sheet is less asset sensitive in comparison to our balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. The decreased asset sensitivity was partly due to a decrease in the relative proportion of interest-bearing deposits (primarily amounts held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve) and federal funds sold to projected average interest-earning assets combined with an increase in the relative proportion of fixed-rate taxable securities to projected average interest-earning assets. Interest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold are more immediately impacted by changes in interest rates in comparison to our other categories of earning assets. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the effects of a 200 basis point increase and a 200 basis point decrease in interest rates on our derivative holdings would not result in a significant variance in our net interest income. 
 The effects of hypothetical fluctuations in interest rates on our securities classified as trading under ASC Topic 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities are not significant, and, as such, separate quantitative disclosure is not presented.

 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 
 
 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 3, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

 Allowances for Credit Losses 
 Description of the Matter 
 The Company s loan portfolio totaled 17.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 and the associated allowance for credit losses on loans was 227.6 million. The Company s unfunded loan commitments totaled 12.5 billion, with an associated allowance for credit loss of 58.6 million. Together these amounts represent the allowances for credit losses ACL ). As discussed in Notes 1, and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, in the cases of loans, the allowance for credit losses is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. As discussed in Notes 1, 3, and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, in the case of unfunded loan commitments, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities. The amount of each allowance account represented management s best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering all available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. In calculating the allowance for credit losses, most loans were segmented into pools based upon similar characteristics and risk profiles. For each loan pool, management measured expected credit losses over the life of each loan utilizing a combination of models which measured probability of default PD ), probability of attrition PA ), loss given default LGD ), and exposure at default EAD ). Modeled expected credit losses were calculated as the product of PD (adjusted for attrition), LGD, and EAD. PD and PA were estimated by analyzing internally sourced data related to historical performance of each loan pool over a complete economic cycle. PD and PA were adjusted to reflect the current impact of certain macroeconomic variables as well as their expected changes over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the forecasted macroeconomic variables were reverted to their historical mean utilizing a rational, systematic basis. The LGD was based on historical recovery averages for each loan pool, adjusted to reflect the current impact of certain macroeconomic variables as well as their expected changes over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. EAD was estimated using a linear regression model that estimates the average percentage of the loan balance that remains at the time of default. In some cases, management determined that an individual loan exhibited unique risk characteristics which differentiated the loan from other loans with the identified loan pools. In such cases, the loans were evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis and excluded from the collective evaluation. Management qualitatively adjusted model results for risk factors that were not considered within the modeling processes but were nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within the loan pools. These qualitative factor adjustments modified management s estimate of expected credit losses by a calculated percentage or amount based upon the estimated level of risk. 
 Auditing management s estimate of the ACL involved a high degree of subjectivity due to the nature of the qualitative factor adjustments included in the allowances for credit losses and complexity due to the utilization of the PD, PA, LGD, and EAD models (the Models ). Management s identification and measurement of the qualitative factor adjustments is highly judgmental and could have a significant effect on the ACL. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 We obtained an understanding of the Company s process for establishing the ACL, including the utilization of Models and the qualitative factor adjustments of the ACL. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of related controls over the reliability and accuracy of data used to calculate and estimate the various components of the ACL, the accuracy of the calculation of the ACL, management s review and approval of methodologies used to establish the ACL, validation procedures over the Models, analysis of changes in various components of the ACL relative to changes in the Company s loan portfolio and economy and evaluation of the overall reasonableness and appropriateness of the ACL. In doing so, we tested the operating effectiveness of review and approval controls in the Company s governance process designed to identify and assess the qualitative factor adjustments which is meant to measure expected credit losses associated with factors not captured fully in the other components of the ACL. 
 To test the reasonableness of the qualitative factor adjustments, we performed audit procedures that included, among others testing the appropriateness of the methodologies used by the Company to estimate the ACL, testing the completeness and accuracy of data and information used by the Company in estimating the components of the ACL, assessing the reasonableness of the Models, evaluating the appropriateness of assumptions used in estimating the qualitative factor adjustments, analyzing the changes in assumptions and various components of the ACL

 relative to changes in the Company s loan portfolio and the economy and evaluating the appropriateness and level of the qualitative factor adjustments. For example, we 1) evaluated the inherent limitations of the Company s modeled components of the ACL and hence the need for and levels of the qualitative factor adjustments; 2) involved modeling specialists to test the appropriateness of the design and operation of the Models; 3) analyzed the changes, assumptions and modifications made to the qualitative factor adjustments; and 4) evaluated the appropriateness and completeness of risk factors used in determining the amount of the qualitative factor adjustments. We also evaluated the data and information utilized by management to estimate the qualitative factor adjustments by independently obtaining internal and external data and information to assess the appropriateness of the data and information used by management and to consider the existence of new and potentially contradictory information used. In addition, we evaluated the overall ACL amounts, inclusive of the adjustments for the qualitative factor adjustments, and whether the amount appropriately reflects losses expected in the loan portfolio as of the consolidated balance sheet date by comparing the overall ACL to those established by similar banking institutions with similar loan portfolios. We also reviewed subsequent events and transactions and considered whether they corroborate or contradict the Company s conclusion.

thousand and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Regulatory guidelines require us to reevaluate the fair value of foreclosed assets on at least an annual basis. Our policy is to comply with the regulatory guidelines. If the fair value of the asset declines, a write-down is recorded through other non-interest expense along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties. The valuation of foreclosed assets is subjective in nature and may be adjusted in the future because of changes in economic conditions. There were write-downs of foreclosed assets in 2022, while write-downs of foreclosed assets totaled thousand in 2021 and thousand in 2020. There were significant concentrations of any properties, to which the aforementioned write-downs relate, in any single geographic region.

to of the opposite change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. If derivative instruments are designated as hedges of fair values, and such hedges are highly effective, both the change in the fair value of the hedge and the hedged item are included in current earnings. Fair value adjustments related to cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income and are reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction is reflected in earnings. Ineffective portions of hedges are reflected in earnings as they occur. Actual cash receipts and/or payments and related accruals on derivatives related to hedges are recorded as adjustments to the interest income or interest expense associated with the hedged item. During the life of the hedge, we formally assess whether derivatives designated as hedging instruments continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of hedged items. If it is determined that a hedge has ceased to be highly effective, we will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. At such time, previous adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged item are reversed into current earnings and the derivative instrument is reclassified to a trading position recorded at fair value.

As discussed above, on January 1, 2020 we adopted the provisions of ASC 326 using the modified retrospective method for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and off-balance-sheet credit exposures.

 million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Accrued interest receivable on held-to-maturity securities totaled million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively and is included in accrued interest receivable and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
 From time to time, we have reclassified certain securities from available for sale to held to maturity. The net unamortized, unrealized gain remaining on securities transferred in years prior to 2020 included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying balance sheet totaled million million, net of tax) at December 31, 2022 and million million, net of tax) at December 31, 2021. This amount will be amortized out of accumulated other comprehensive income over the remaining life of the underlying securities as an adjustment of the yield on those securities. 
 The allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities is a contra-asset valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of held-to-maturity securities to present the net amount expected to be collected. Management measures expected credit losses on held-to-maturity securities on a collective basis by major security type with each type sharing similar risk characteristics, and considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. With regard to U.S. Treasury and residential mortgage-backed securities issued by the U.S. government, or agencies thereof, it is expected that the securities will not be settled at prices less than the amortized cost bases of the securities as such securities are backed by the full faith and credit of and/or guaranteed by the U.S. government. Accordingly, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded for these securities. With regard to securities issued by States and political subdivisions and other held-to-maturity securities, management considers (i) issuer bond ratings, (ii) historical loss rates for given bond ratings, (iii) whether issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities, (iv) internal forecasts and (v) whether or not such securities are guaranteed by the Texas Permanent School Fund PSF or pre-refunded by the issuers.

 Historical loss rates associated with securities having similar grades as those in our portfolio have generally not been significant. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2022, there were past due principal or interest payments associated with these securities. The PSF is a sovereign wealth fund which serves to provide revenues for funding of public primary and secondary education in the State of Texas. Based upon (i) the PSF's AAA insurer financial strength rating, (ii) the PSF's substantial capitalization and excess guarantee capacity and (iii) a zero historical loss rate, allowance for credit losses has been recorded for securities guaranteed by the PSF as there is current expectation of credit losses related to these securities. Pre-refunded securities have been defeased by the issuer and are fully secured by cash and/or U.S. Treasury securities held in escrow for payment to holders when the underlying call dates of the securities are reached. Accordingly, allowance for credit losses has been recorded for securities that have been defeased as there is current expectation of credit losses related to these securities.

 Non-Accrual and Past Due Loans. Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when, in management s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. In determining whether or not a borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations for each class of loans, we consider the borrower s debt service capacity through the analysis of current financial information, if available, and/or current information with regards to our collateral position. Regulatory provisions would typically require the placement of a loan on non-accrual status if (i) principal or interest has been in default for a period of days or more unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection or (ii) full payment of principal and interest is not expected. Loans may be placed on non-accrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest income on non-accrual loans is recognized only to the extent that cash payments are received in excess of principal due. A loan may be returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured, which is typically evidenced by a sustained period (at least six months) of repayment performance by the borrower.

 Troubled Debt Restructurings . The restructuring of a loan is considered a troubled debt restructuring if both (i) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and (ii) the creditor has granted a concession.

 days past due and not fully secured and loans where a specific valuation allowance may be necessary, but generally does not exceed of the principal balance. 
 Grade 13 - This grade includes Doubtful loans in accordance with regulatory guidelines. Such loans are placed on non-accrual status and may be dependent upon collateral having a value that is difficult to determine or upon some near-term event which lacks certainty. Additionally, these loans generally have a specific valuation allowance in excess of of the principal balance. 
 Grade 14 - This grade includes Loss loans in accordance with regulatory guidelines. Such loans are to be charged-off or charged-down when payment is acknowledged to be uncertain or when the timing or value of payments cannot be determined. Loss is not intended to imply that the loan or some portion of it will never be paid, nor does it in any way imply that there has been a forgiveness of debt. 
 In monitoring credit quality trends in the context of assessing the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses on loans, we monitor portfolio credit quality by the weighted-average risk grade of each class of commercial loan. Individual relationship managers, under the oversight of credit administration, review updated financial information for all pass grade loans to reassess the risk grade on at least an annual basis. When a loan has a risk grade of 9, it is still considered a pass grade loan; however, it is considered to be on management s watch list, where a significant risk-modifying action is anticipated in the near term. When a loan has a risk grade of 10 or higher, a special assets officer monitors the loan on an on-going basis.

 In assessing the general economic conditions in the State of Texas, management monitors and tracks the Texas Leading Index TLI ), which is produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. The TLI is a single summary statistic that is designed to signal the likelihood of the Texas economy s transition from expansion to recession and vice versa. Management believes this index provides a reliable indication of the direction of overall credit quality. The TLI is a composite of the following eight leading indicators: (i) Texas Value of the Dollar, (ii) U.S. Leading

 cumulative days are charged-off. Generally, a consumer loan, or a portion thereof, is charged-off in accordance with regulatory guidelines which provide that such loans be charged-off when we become aware of the loss, such as from a triggering event that may include new information about a borrower s intent/ability to repay the loan, bankruptcy, fraud or death, among other things, but in any event the charge-off must be taken within specified delinquency time frames. Such delinquency time frames state that closed-end retail loans (loans with pre-defined maturity dates, such as real estate mortgages, home equity loans and consumer installment loans) that become past due cumulative days and open-end retail loans (loans that roll-over at the end of each term, such as home equity lines of credit) that become past due cumulative days should be classified as a loss and charged-off.

 million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are secured short-term borrowings that typically mature overnight or within thirty to ninety days. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are stated at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction. We may be required to provide additional collateral based on the fair value of the underlying securities. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled billion and billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 Subordinated Notes. In March 2017, we issued million of subordinated notes that mature on . The notes, which qualify as Tier 2 capital for Cullen/Frost, bear interest at the rate of per annum, payable semi-annually on each March 17 and September 17. The notes are unsecured and subordinated in right of payment to the payment of our existing and future senior indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries. Unamortized debt issuance costs related to these notes, totaled approximately thousand and thousand December 31, 2022 and 2021. Proceeds from sale of the notes were used for general corporate purposes. 
 Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had million of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued to Cullen/Frost Capital Trust II Trust II ), a wholly owned Delaware statutory business trust. Unamortized debt issuance costs related to Trust II totaled thousand and thousand at December 31, 2022 and 2021. In October 2021, we redeemed million of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued to WNB Capital Trust I WNB Trust ), a wholly owned Delaware statutory business trust acquired in connection with the acquisition of WNB Bancshares, Inc. WNB in 2014. Trust II is a variable interest entity for which we are not the primary beneficiary and, as such, its accounts are not included in our consolidated financial statements. This was also the case with WNB Trust prior to its dissolution in 2021. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information about our consolidation policy. Details of our transactions with the capital trust are presented below. 
 Trust II was formed in 2004 for the purpose of issuing million of floating rate (three-month LIBOR plus a margin of trust preferred securities, which represent beneficial interests in the assets of the trust. The trust preferred securities will mature on and are currently redeemable with the approval of the Federal Reserve Board in whole or in part at our option. Distributions on the trust preferred securities are payable quarterly in arrears on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year. Trust II also issued million of common equity securities to Cullen/Frost. The proceeds of the offering of the trust preferred securities and common equity securities were used to purchase million of floating rate (three-month LIBOR plus a margin of , which was equal to and at December 31, 2022 and 2021) junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued by us, which have terms substantially similar to the trust preferred securities. 
 We have the right at any time during the term of the debentures issued to Trust II to defer payments of interest at any time or from time to time for an extension period not exceeding consecutive quarterly periods with respect to each extension period. Under the terms of the debentures, in the event that under certain circumstances there is an event of default under the debentures or we have elected to defer interest on the debentures, we may not, with certain exceptions, declare or pay any dividends or distributions on our capital stock or purchase or acquire any of our capital stock. 
 Payments of distributions on the trust preferred securities and payments on redemption of the trust preferred securities are guaranteed by us on a limited basis. We are obligated by agreement to pay any costs, expenses or liabilities of Trust II other than those arising under the trust preferred securities. Our obligations under the junior subordinated debentures, the related indenture, the trust agreement establishing the trust, the guarantee and the agreement as to expenses and liabilities, in the aggregate, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by us of Trust II s obligations under the trust preferred securities. 
 Although the accounts of Trust II are not included in our consolidated financial statements, the trust preferred securities issued by Trust II are included in the capital of Cullen/Frost for regulatory capital purposes. See Note 9 - Capital and Regulatory Matters.

 Trust Accounts . We hold certain assets which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets including assets held in fiduciary or custodial capacity on behalf of our trust customers. The estimated fair value of trust assets was approximately billion and billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These assets are primarily composed of equity securities, fixed income securities, alternative investments and cash equivalents, among other things. 
 Executive Change-In-Control Severance Plan . We maintain a change-in-control severance plan for the benefit of certain executive officers. Under this plan, each covered person could receive, upon the effectiveness of a change-in-control, two to three times (depending on the person) their base compensation plus the target bonus established for the year, and any unpaid base salary and pro rata target bonus for the year in which the termination occurs, including vacation pay. Additionally, the executive s insurance benefits will continue for two to three full years after the termination and all long-term incentive awards will immediately vest. 
 Litigation . We are subject to various claims and legal actions that have arisen in the course of conducting business. Management does not expect the ultimate disposition of these matters to have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.

 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, the details of which is are further discussed below. Frost Bank did t have any additional Tier 1 capital beyond Common Equity Tier 1 at December 31, 2022 or 2021. 
 Total capital includes Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital for both Cullen/Frost and Frost Bank includes a permissible portion of the allowance for credit losses on securities, loans and off-balance sheet exposures. Tier 2 capital for Cullen/Frost also includes trust preferred securities that were excluded from Tier 1 capital and qualified subordinated debt. Cullen/Frost's Tier 2 capital included million of trust preferred securities at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. Cullen/Frost's Tier 2 Capital also included million at December 31, 2022 and million at December 31, 2021 related to the permissible portion of our aggregate million of subordinated notes. The permissible portion of qualified subordinated notes decreases per year during the final five years of the term of the notes. 
 The Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratios are calculated by dividing the respective capital amounts by risk-weighted assets. Risk-weighted assets are calculated based on regulatory requirements and include 
 103 

Table of Contents 

 , plus a capital conservation buffer (which is added to the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least ), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least , plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the Tier 1 capital ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of ), (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of at least , plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the total capital ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of , calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average quarterly assets. 
 The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress and, as detailed above, effectively increases the minimum required risk-weighted capital ratios. Banking institutions with a ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets below the effective minimum plus the capital conservation buffer and, if applicable, the countercyclical capital buffer, which is discussed below) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall and the institution's eligible retained income (that is, four quarter trailing net income, net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income). The countercyclical capital buffer is applicable to only certain covered institutions and does not have any current applicability to Cullen/Frost or Frost Bank. 
 As discussed in Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies, in connection with the adoption of ASC 326, we recognized an after-tax cumulative effect reduction to retained earnings totaling million on January 1, 2020. In February 2019, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule (the 2019 CECL Rule that revised certain capital regulations to account for changes to credit loss accounting under U.S. GAAP. The 2019 CECL Rule included a transition option that allows banking organizations to phase in, over a three-year period, the day-one adverse effects of CECL on their regulatory capital ratios (three-year transition option). In March 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that maintains the three-year transition option of the 2019 CECL Rule and also provides banking organizations that were required under U.S. GAAP (as of January 2020) to implement CECL before the end of 2020 the option to delay for two years an estimate of the effect of CECL on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three -year transition period five -year transition option). We elected to adopt the five -year transition option. Accordingly, CECL transitional amounts have been added back to CET1 totaling million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 In April 2020, we began originating loans to qualified small businesses under the PPP administered by the SBA. Federal bank regulatory agencies have issued an interim final rule that permits banks to neutralize the regulatory capital effects of participating in the Paycheck Protection Program Lending Facility (the PPP Facility and clarify that PPP loans have a zero percent risk weight under applicable risk-based capital rules. Specifically, a bank may exclude all PPP loans pledged as collateral to the PPP Facility from its average total consolidated assets for the purposes of calculating its leverage ratio, while PPP loans that are not pledged as collateral to the PPP Facility will be included. Our PPP loans are included in the calculation of our leverage ratio as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 as we did not utilize the PPP Facility for funding purposes.

 Series B Preferred Stock. On November 19, 2020, we issued shares, or million in aggregate liquidation preference, of our Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, par value and liquidation preference per share Series B Preferred Stock ). Each share of Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding is represented by depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of the Series B Preferred Stock (equivalent to a liquidation preference of per share). Each holder of depositary shares will be entitled, in proportion to the applicable fraction of a share of Series B Preferred Stock represented by

The net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Series B Preferred Stock, after deducting million of issuance costs including the underwriting discount and professional service fees, among other things, were approximately million. 
 The Series B Preferred Stock is perpetual and has no maturity date. We may redeem the Series B Preferred Stock at our option (i) in whole or in part, from time to time, on any dividend payment date on or after December 15, 2025 or (ii) in whole but not in part, within 90 days following certain changes in laws or regulations impacting the regulatory capital treatment of the Series B Preferred Stock, in either case, at a redemption price equal to per share of Series B Preferred Stock (equivalent to per depositary share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends for prior dividend periods and accrued but unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) for the then-current dividend period prior to but excluding the redemption date. If we redeem the Series B Preferred Stock, the depositary is expected redeem a proportionate number of depositary shares. Neither the holders of Series B Preferred Stock nor holders of depositary shares will have the right to require the redemption or repurchase of the Series B Preferred Stock or the depositary shares. 
 Series A Preferred Stock. On February 15, 2013, we issued and sold shares, or million in aggregate liquidation preference, of our Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, par value and liquidation preference per share Series A Preferred Stock ). On March 16, 2020, we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock at a redemption price of per share, or an aggregate redemption of million. When issued, the net proceeds of the Series A Preferred Stock totaled million after deducting million of issuance costs including the underwriting discount and professional service fees, among other things. Upon redemption, these issuance costs were reclassified to retained earnings and reported as a reduction of net income available to common shareholders. Prior to redemption, dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock were paid quarterly, in arrears, at a rate of per annum and the Series A Preferred Stock qualified as Tier 1 capital for the purposes of regulatory capital calculations. 
 Stock Repurchase Plans. From time to time, our board of directors has authorized stock repurchase plans. In general, stock repurchase plans allow us to proactively manage our capital position and return excess capital to shareholders. Shares purchased under such plans also provide us with shares of common stock necessary to satisfy obligations related to stock compensation awards. On January 25, 2023, our board of directors authorized a million stock repurchase plan, allowing us to repurchase shares of our common stock over a one -year period from time to time at various prices in the open market or through private transactions. shares were repurchased under a stock repurchase plan during 2022 or 2021. Under a prior stock repurchase plan, we repurchased, shares at a total cost of million during 2020. 
 In July 2019, the federal bank regulators adopted final rules (the Capital Simplifications Rules that, among other things, eliminated the standalone prior approval requirement in the Basel III Capital Rules for any repurchase of common stock. In certain circumstances, Cullen/Frost s repurchases of its common stock may be subject to a prior approval or notice requirement under other regulations, policies or supervisory expectations of the Federal Reserve Board. Any redemption or repurchase of preferred stock or subordinated debt remains subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. 
 In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA was enacted. Among other things, the IRA imposes a new 1 excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased after December 31, 2022 by publicly traded U.S. corporations. With certain exceptions, the value of stock repurchased is determined net of stock issued in the year, including shares issued pursuant to compensatory arrangements. 
 Dividend Restrictions . In the ordinary course of business, Cullen/Frost is dependent upon dividends from Frost Bank to provide funds for the payment of dividends to shareholders and to provide for other cash requirements, including to repurchase its common stock. Banking regulations may limit the amount of dividends that may be paid. Approval by regulatory authorities is required if the effect of dividends declared would cause the regulatory capital of Frost Bank to fall below specified minimum levels. Approval is also required if dividends declared exceed the net profits for that year combined with the retained net profits for the preceding two years. Under the foregoing dividend

 Under the terms of the junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures that Cullen/Frost has issued to Cullen/Frost Capital Trust II, Cullen/Frost has the right at any time during the term of the debentures to defer the payment of interest at any time or from time to time for an extension period not exceeding consecutive quarterly periods with respect to each extension period. In the event that we have elected to defer interest on the debentures, we may not, with certain exceptions, declare or pay any dividends or distributions on our capital stock or purchase or acquire any of our capital stock. 
 Under the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, in the event that we do not declare and pay dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock for the most recent dividend period, we may not, with certain exceptions, declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our common stock or any of our securities that rank junior to the Series B Preferred Stock.

 Management uses an asset allocation optimization model to analyze the potential risks and rewards associated with various asset allocation strategies on a quarterly basis. As of December 31, 2022, management s investment objective for our defined benefit plans is to achieve long-term growth. This strategy provides for a target asset allocation of approximately invested in equity securities, approximately invested in fixed income debt securities with any remainder invested in cash or short-term cash equivalents. The asset allocation optimization process provides portfolio allocations which best represent the potential risk associated with a given asset allocation over a full market cycle. This is used to help management determine an appropriate mix of assets in order to achieve the plan's long term investment goals. The plan assets are reviewed annually to determine if the obligations can be met with the current investment mix and funding strategy. 
 Cash and cash equivalents Total fair value of plan assets 
 Mutual funds include various equity, fixed-income and blended funds with varying investment strategies. Approximately of mutual fund investments consist of equity investments as of December 31, 2022. The investment objective of equity funds is long-term capital appreciation with current income. The remaining mutual fund investments consist of U.S. fixed-income securities, including investment-grade U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities and mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds and notes and collateralized mortgage obligations. The investment objective of fixed-income funds is to maximize investment return while preserving investment principal. Our investment strategies prohibit selling assets short and the use of derivatives. Additionally, our defined benefit plans do not directly invest in real estate, commodities, or private investments.

 Savings Plans 
 401(k) Stock Purchase Plan and Other Plans. We maintain a 401(k) stock purchase plan that permits each participant to make before-tax contributions in an amount not less than and not exceeding of eligible compensation and subject to dollar limits from Internal Revenue Service regulations. We match of the employee s contributions to the plan based on the amount of each participant s contributions up to a maximum of of eligible compensation. Eligible employees must complete 30 days of service in order to enroll and vest in our matching contributions immediately. Our matching contribution is initially invested in the common stock of Cullen/Frost. Employees may immediately reallocate our matching portion, as well as invest their individual contribution, to any of a variety of investment alternatives offered under the 401(k) Plan. We may also make discretionary profit sharing contributions to eligible participants. 
 All profit sharing contributions to the plan are made at our discretion and may be made without regard to current or accumulated profits. Contributions are generally allocated to eligible participants uniformly, based upon compensation, age and/or other factors. Plan participants self-direct the investment of allocated contributions by choosing from a menu of investment options. Profit sharing contributions are subject to withdrawal restrictions and participants vest in their allocated contributions after three years of service. Expense related to the plan totaled million in 2022, million in 2021 and million in 2020. 
 We maintain a thrift incentive stock purchase plan and a separate non-qualified profit sharing plan to offer certain employees, whose participation in the 401(k) plan is limited, an alternative means of receiving comparable benefits. Expense related to these plans was not significant during 2022, 2021 and 2020. 
 Stock Compensation Plans 
 active stock compensation plans (the 2005 Omnibus Incentive Plan, the 2007 Outside Directors Incentive Plan and the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan). All of the plans have been approved by our shareholders. During 2015, the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan 2015 Plan was established to replace both the 2005 Omnibus Incentive Plan 2005 Plan and the 2007 Outside Directors Incentive Plan (the 2007 Directors Plan ). All remaining shares authorized for grant under the superseded 2005 Plan and 2007 Directors Plan were transferred to the 2015 Plan. Our stock compensation plans were established to (i) motivate superior performance by means of performance-related incentives, (ii) encourage and provide for the acquisition of an ownership interest in our company by employees and non-employee directors and (iii) enable us to attract and retain qualified and competent persons as employees and to serve as members of our board of directors. 
 Under the 2015 Plan, we may grant, among other things, nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock awards, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, performance share units or any combination thereof to certain employees and non-employee directors.

The ultimate number of shares issuable under each performance award is the product of the award target and the award payout percentage for the given level of achievement. The level of achievement is measured as the amount by which adjusted net revenue, averaged over a three-year performance period, exceeds the 2022 and 2021 base-year amounts, as applicable, stated as an average growth percentage.

Achievement between the aforementioned average growth percentages will result in an award payout percentage determined based on straight-line interpolation between the percentages. 
 For performance stock units granted prior to 2021, issuance is based upon the measure of our achievement of relative return on assets over a three-year performance period compared to an identified peer group's achievement of relative return on assets over the same three-year performance period. The ultimate number of shares issuable under each performance award is the product of the award target and the award payout percentage for the given level of achievement. The level of achievement is measured as the percentile rank of relative return on assets among the peer group. The award payout percentages by level of achievement are as follows: (i) less than 25th percentile pays out at of target, (ii) 25th percentile pays out at of target, (iii) 50th percentile pays out at of target and (iv) 75th percentile or more pays out at of target. Achievement between the aforementioned percentiles will result in an award payout percentage determined based on straight-line interpolation between the percentiles. 
 Performance stock units are eligible to receive equivalent dividend payments as such dividends are declared on our common stock during the performance period. Equivalent dividend payments are based upon the ultimate number of shares issued under each performance award and are deferred until such time that the units vest and shares are issued.

 Foreign Currency Derivatives . We enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments primarily to accommodate the business needs of our customers. Upon the origination of a foreign currency denominated transaction with a customer, we simultaneously enter into an offsetting contract with a third-party financial institution to negate the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We also utilize foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the economic effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on foreign currency holdings and certain short-term, non-U.S. dollar denominated loans.

 Gains, Losses and Derivative Cash Flows . For fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of both the derivative hedging instrument and the hedged item are included in other non-interest income or other non-interest expense. The extent that such changes in fair value do not offset represents hedge ineffectiveness. Net cash flows from interest rate swaps on commercial loans/leases designated as hedging instruments in effective hedges of fair value are included in interest income on loans. For non-hedging derivative instruments, gains and losses due to changes in fair value and all cash flows are included in other non-interest income and other non-interest expense.

 As stated above, we enter into non-hedge related derivative positions primarily to accommodate the business needs of our customers. Upon the origination of a derivative contract with a customer, we simultaneously enter into an offsetting derivative contract with a third-party financial institution. We recognize immediate income based upon the difference in the bid/ask spread of the underlying transactions with our customers and the third party. Because we act only as an intermediary for our customer, subsequent changes in the fair value of the underlying derivative contracts for the most part offset each other and do not significantly impact our results of operations. 
 Other non-interest expense ) Non-hedging commodity derivatives: Other non-interest income Non-hedging foreign currency derivatives: Other non-interest income Non-hedging other derivatives: Other non-interest income 
 During 2020, we sold certain non-hedge related, short-term put options on U.S. Treasury securities and realized gains totaling approximately million in connection with the sales. The put options expired without being exercised. These gains are included in the table above as a component of non-hedging other derivatives. 
 Counterparty Credit Risk. Derivative contracts involve the risk of dealing with both bank customers and institutional derivative counterparties and their ability to meet contractual terms. Institutional counterparties must have an investment grade credit rating and be approved by our Asset/Liability Management Committee. Our credit exposure on derivative contracts is limited to the net favorable value of all contracts by each counterparty. Credit exposure may be reduced by the amount of collateral pledged by the counterparty. There are no credit-risk-related contingent features associated with any of our derivative contracts. Certain derivative contracts with upstream financial institution counterparties may be terminated with respect to a party in the transaction, if such party does not have at least a minimum level rating assigned to either its senior unsecured long-term debt or its deposit obligations by certain third-party rating agencies. 
 Our credit exposure relating to interest rate swaps, commodity swaps/options and foreign currency forward contracts with bank customers was approximately million at December 31, 2022. This credit exposure is partly mitigated as transactions with customers are generally secured by the collateral, if any, securing the underlying transaction being hedged. Our credit exposure, net of collateral pledged, relating to interest rate swaps, commodity swaps/options and foreign currency forward contracts with upstream financial institution counterparties was approximately million at December 31, 2022. This amount was primarily related to excess collateral we posted to counterparties. Collateral levels for upstream financial institution counterparties are monitored and adjusted as necessary. See Note 16 Balance Sheet Offsetting and Repurchase Agreements for additional information regarding our credit exposure with upstream financial institution counterparties. At December 31, 2022, the aggregate fair value of securities we posted as collateral related to derivative contracts totaled million. We also had million in cash collateral related to derivative contracts on deposit with other financial institution counterparties at December 31, 2022.

The fair value measurement option (i) may be applied instrument by instrument, with certain exceptions, (ii) is generally irrevocable and (iii) is applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value measurement option has been elected must be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. During the reported periods, we had financial instruments measured at fair value under the fair value measurement option.

 primary operating segments, Banking and Frost Wealth Advisors, overlap a regional reporting structure. The regions are primarily based upon geographic location and include Austin, Corpus Christi, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, Permian Basin, Rio Grande Valley, San Antonio and Statewide. We are primarily managed based on the line of business structure. In that regard, all regions have the same lines of business, which have the same product and service offerings, have similar types and classes of customers and utilize similar service delivery methods. Pricing guidelines for products and services are the same across all regions. The regional reporting structure is primarily a means to scale the lines of business to provide a local, community focus for customer relations and business development. 
 Banking and Frost Wealth Advisors are delineated by the products and services that each segment offers. The Banking operating segment includes both commercial and consumer banking services and Frost Insurance Agency. Commercial banking services are provided to corporations and other business clients and include a wide array of lending and cash management products. Consumer banking services include direct lending and depository services. Frost Insurance Agency provides insurance brokerage services to individuals and businesses covering corporate and personal property and casualty products, as well as group health and life insurance products. The Frost Wealth Advisors operating segment includes fee-based services within private trust, retirement services, and financial management services, including personal wealth management and securities brokerage services. A third operating segment, Non-Banks, is for the most part the parent holding company, as well as certain other insignificant non-bank subsidiaries of the parent that, for the most part, have little or no activity. The parent company s principal activities include the direct and indirect ownership of our banking and non-banking subsidiaries and the issuance of debt and equity. Our principal source of revenue is dividends from our subsidiaries. 
 The accounting policies of each reportable segment are the same as those of our consolidated entity except for the following items, which impact the Banking and Frost Wealth Advisors segments: (i) expenses for consolidated back-office operations and general overhead-type expenses such as executive administration, accounting and internal audit are allocated to operating segments based on estimated uses of those services, (ii) income tax expense for the individual segments is calculated essentially at the statutory rate, and (iii) the parent company records the tax expense or benefit necessary to reconcile to the consolidated total. 
 We use a match-funded transfer pricing process to assess operating segment performance. The process helps us to (i) identify the cost or opportunity value of funds within each business segment, (ii) measure the profitability of a particular business segment by relating appropriate costs to revenues, (iii) evaluate each business segment in a manner consistent with its economic impact on consolidated earnings, and (iv) enhance asset and liability pricing decisions.

 ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. ASU 2017-04 eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test which required entities to compute the implied fair value of goodwill. Under ASU 2017-04, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 became effective for us on January 1, 2020 and did not have a significant impact on our financial statements.

 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, an evaluation was carried out by our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. No changes were made to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 The management of Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
 As of December 31, 2022, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations COSO of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework ). Based on the assessment, management determined that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on those criteria.

 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).

 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES B 
 Description of the Preferred Stock 
 Computershare Inc., as the depositary, is the sole holder of our Preferred Stock, and all references herein to the holders of the Preferred Stock shall mean the depositary. However, the holders of the Depositary Shares are entitled, through the depositary, to exercise the rights and preferences of the holders of the Preferred Stock, as described below under Description of Depositary Shares. 
 The following description of the Preferred Stock is a summary and does not describe every right, term or condition of owning the Preferred Stock. It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the pertinent sections of our Articles of Incorporation, including the certificate of designations creating the Preferred Stock, and any applicable provisions of relevant law, including the applicable provisions of the Texas Business Organizations Code and federal law governing bank holding companies. 
 General 
 Our Articles of Incorporation authorizes us to issue 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and authorizes our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of the board to fix the number of shares and determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of any such series of preferred stock. 
 The Preferred Stock represents a single series of our authorized preferred stock, consisting of 150,000 shares having a par value of 0.01 per share. The Preferred Stock is not convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or series of our stock or other securities and is not subject to any sinking fund or other obligation to redeem or repurchase. 
 Dividend Rights 
 Holders of the Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of the board, out of funds legally available therefor, non-cumulative cash dividends at a rate of 4.450 per annum on the liquidation preference amount of 1,000 per share of Preferred Stock. Dividends on the Preferred Stock are payable quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, with respect to the quarterly dividend period (or portion thereof) ending on the day preceding such respective dividend payment date. 
 Redemption 
 The Preferred Stock will not be subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund, or other similar provisions. The holders of Preferred Stock will not have the right to require the redemption or repurchase of the Preferred Stock. 
 Optional Redemption. We may redeem shares of the Preferred Stock at our option on any dividend payment date on or after December 15, 2025, in whole or in part, from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 1,000 per share of Preferred Stock (equivalent to 25 per Depositary Share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock called for redemption for prior dividend periods and accrued but unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) for the then-current dividend period prior to but excluding the redemption date. Redemption of the Preferred Stock is subject to our receipt of any required prior approvals from the Federal Reserve and to the satisfaction of any conditions set forth in the capital or other guidelines or regulations of the Federal Reserve applicable to the redemption of the Preferred Stock. 
 Redemption Following a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event. We may redeem shares of the Preferred Stock at our option at any time within 90 days following a regulatory capital treatment event (as defined in the certificate of designations creating the Preferred Stock), in whole but not in part, at a price equal to 1,000 per share of Preferred Stock (equivalent to 25 per Depositary Share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends for prior dividend periods and accrued but unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) for the then-current dividend period prior to but excluding the redemption date. Redemption of the Preferred Stock is subject to our receipt of any required prior approvals from the Federal Reserve and to the satisfaction of any conditions set forth in the capital or other guidelines or regulations of the Federal Reserve applicable to the redemption of the Preferred Stock.

Liquidation Rights 
 In the event we liquidate, dissolve or wind-up our affairs, either voluntarily or involuntarily, holders of the Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive in full an amount equal to 1,000 per share of Preferred Stock (equivalent to 25 per Depositary Share), together with an amount equal to all dividends (if any) that have been declared on the Preferred Stock but not paid prior to such date of payment (but without any amount in respect of dividends that have not been declared prior to such payment date), before we make any distribution or payment out of our assets to the holders of our common stock or any other class or series of stock ranking junior to the Preferred Stock with respect to the distribution of assets. 
 If we fail to pay in full all amounts payable, including declared but unpaid dividends, with respect to the Preferred Stock and any stock having the same rank as the Preferred Stock with respect to the distribution of assets, the holders of the Preferred Stock and that other stock will share in any distribution of assets in proportion to the respective aggregate liquidation preferences to which they are entitled including an amount equal to any declared but unpaid dividends (and, in the case of any holder of stock on which dividends accrue on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to any unpaid, accrued, cumulative dividends, whether or not declared, as applicable). After the holders of the Preferred Stock and any stock having the same rank as the Preferred Stock are paid in full, they will have no right or claim to any of our remaining assets. 
 Neither the sale, lease, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or any part of our property or business nor a merger or consolidation by us with or into any other entity will be considered a dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of our business or affairs. 
 Voting Rights 
 The Preferred Stock has no voting rights, except as provided below or as otherwise specifically required by Texas law. On any matter in which holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, including when acting by written consent, each holder of Preferred Stock will have one vote per share, except as to votes upon a Nonpayment Event (as defined below) in which case the Preferred Stock will have voting rights in proportion to its liquidation preference. 
 Right to Elect Two Directors upon a Nonpayment Event. Whenever dividends payable on the shares of Preferred Stock (whether or not declared) have not been paid in an aggregate amount equal to full dividends for six or more quarterly dividend periods, whether or not consecutive (a Nonpayment Event ), the authorized number of our directors will automatically be increased by two. The holders of the Preferred Stock will have the right, together with holders of any other series of preferred stock on which similar voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable with respect to the matter (i.e., on which dividends likewise have not been paid), voting together as a class in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences, by a plurality of the votes cast, to elect two directors to fill such newly created directorships. 
 Other Voting Rights . So long as any shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding and not called for redemption, the vote or consent of the holders of at least 66 2 3 of the then-outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a single class, is necessary for effecting or validating certain changes, including certain amendments, alterations or repeals of any provision of our Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws that would significantly and adversely affect the Preferred Stock, binding share exchanges or reclassifications or mergers or consolidations involving Cullen Frost. 
 Preemptive and Conversion Rights 
 The holders of the Preferred Stock do not have any preemptive rights. The Preferred Stock is not convertible into or exchangeable for property or shares of any other series or class of our capital stock. 
 Certain Anti-Takeover Matters 
 The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws include a number of provisions that may have the effect of encouraging persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals to negotiate with the board of directors rather than pursue non-negotiated takeover attempts. These provisions include the following 
 Advance Notice Requirements 
 The Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with regard to shareholder proposals relating to the nomination of candidates for election as directors or new business to be brought before meetings of shareholders of Cullen Frost. These procedures provide that notice of such shareholder proposals must be timely given in writing to the Secretary of Cullen Frost prior to the meeting at which the action is to be taken. Generally, to be timely, notice must be received not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the date of the meeting. The notice must contain certain information specified in the Bylaws. 
 -3- 

Limitation on Ability of Shareholders to Call Special Meetings 
 The Bylaws provide procedures pursuant to which holders of record of not less than 10 of the voting power of outstanding shares of the common stock may call a special meeting of shareholders. 
 Amendment of Bylaws 
 Amendments of the Bylaws require the approval of either a majority of the board of directors or the vote of the holders of three-quarters of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon. 
 Removal of Directors 
 In order for any director to be removed, the Bylaws require the vote of the holders of two-thirds of the shares then entitled to vote for the election of directors. 
 Description of the Depositary Shares 
 General 
 The Depositary Shares represent proportional fractional interests in shares of the Preferred Stock. Each Depositary Share represents a 1 40th ownership interest in one share of the Preferred Stock, and is evidenced by a depositary receipt. We deposited the underlying Preferred Stock with a depositary pursuant to a deposit agreement among us, Computershare Inc. acting as depositary, and the holders from time to time of the depositary receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares (the Deposit Agreement ). Subject to the terms of the Deposit Agreement, each holder of a Depositary Share is entitled, through the depositary, in proportion to the applicable fraction of a share of Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Share, to all the rights and preferences of the Preferred Stock represented thereby (including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights). 
 Dividends and Other Distributions 
 Each dividend payable on a Depositary Share will be in an amount equal to 1 40th of the dividend declared and payable on the related share of the Preferred Stock. 
 The depositary will distribute any cash dividends or other cash distributions received in respect of the deposited Preferred Stock to the record holders of Depositary Shares relating to the underlying Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of Depositary Shares held by the holders. 
 Record dates for the payment of dividends and other matters relating to the Depositary Shares will be the same as the corresponding record dates for the Preferred Stock. 
 Withdrawal of Preferred Stock 
 In accordance with the requirements of the Deposit Agreement, a holder of depositary receipts may withdraw the number of whole shares of Preferred Stock represented thereby by surrendering such receipts at the office of the depositary at which its depositary receipt business is administered or at such other offices designated by the depositary provided, however that no such whole shares of Preferred Stock which have previously been called for redemption may be withdrawn. In no event will fractional shares of the Preferred Stock (or any cash payment in lieu thereof) be delivered by the depositary. 
 Holders of such whole shares of Preferred Stock so withdrawn will not thereafter be entitled to deposit such shares of Preferred Stock under the Deposit Agreement or to receive a depositary receipt evidencing Depositary Shares for those shares of Preferred Stock. If the Depositary Shares surrendered by the holder in connection with the withdrawal exceed the number of Depositary Shares that represent the number of whole shares of Preferred Stock to be withdrawn, the depositary will deliver to the holder at the same time a new depositary receipt evidencing the excess number of Depositary Shares. 
 Redemption of Depositary Shares 
 If we redeem the Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares, the Depositary Shares will be redeemed from the proceeds received by the depositary resulting from the redemption of the Preferred Stock held by the depositary. The redemption price per Depositary Share is expected to be equal to 1 40th of the redemption price per share payable with respect to the Preferred Stock (or 25 per Depositary Share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends (without accumulation of any undeclared dividends). 
 -4- 

If we redeem shares of Preferred Stock held by the depositary, the depositary will redeem, as of the same redemption date, the number of Depositary Shares representing shares of Preferred Stock so redeemed. If fewer than all of the outstanding Depositary Shares are redeemed, the depositary will select the Depositary Shares to be redeemed pro rata or by lot or in such other manner proportionate and applicable to the manner in which shares of the Preferred Stock are redeemed as determined to be fair and equitable by our board of directors or a duly authorized committee thereof. The depositary will mail notice of redemption to record holders of the depositary receipts not less than 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption of the Preferred Stock and the related Depositary Shares. 
 Voting the Depositary Shares 
 Because each Depositary Share represents a 1 40th interest in a share of the Preferred Stock, holders of depositary receipts will be entitled to 1 40th of a vote per Depositary Share under those limited circumstances in which holders of the Preferred Stock are entitled to a vote. 
 When the depositary receives notice of any meeting at which the holders of the Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, the depositary will mail (or otherwise transmit by an authorized method) the information contained in the notice to the record holders of the Depositary Shares relating to the Preferred Stock. Each record holder of the Depositary Shares on the record date, which will be the same date as the record date for the Preferred Stock, may instruct the depositary to vote the amount of the Preferred Stock represented by the holder s Depositary Shares. To the extent possible, the depositary will vote the maximum number of whole shares of Preferred Stock represented by Depositary Shares as to which any particular voting instructions are received in accordance with the instructions it receives. We will agree to take all reasonable actions that the depositary determines are necessary to enable the depositary to vote as instructed. If the depositary does not receive specific instructions from the holders of any Depositary Shares representing the Preferred Stock, it will not vote the amount of the Preferred Stock represented by such Depositary Shares. 
 Preemptive and Conversion Rights 
 The holders of the Depositary Shares do not have any preemptive or conversion rights. 
 Registrar, Transfer Agent, Dividend Disbursing Agent and Redemption Agent 
 Computershare Inc. is the registrar, transfer agent, dividend disbursing agent and redemption agent in respect of the depositary receipts evidencing the Depositary Shares. 
 Depositary 
 Computershare Inc. is the depositary for the Depositary Shares. 
 Form of Depositary Shares 
 The Depositary Shares have been issued in book-entry form through DTC. 
 Listing 
 The Depositary Shares are listed on the NYSE under the symbol CFR PrB.

DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES 
 The following is a brief description of the terms of the Notes and the relevant indenture (the Indenture ). It does not purport to be complete in all respects. This description is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Notes and the Indenture, which has been filed with the SEC and are available upon request from Cullen Frost. 
 General 
 We issued 100,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes on March 17, 2017. We have the right to issue additional notes of the same series without the consent of the holders of the Notes. Any such additional notes would have the same terms as the Notes (except for the issue date and public offering price). The Notes are unsecured and subordinated in right of payment to all our senior indebtedness and effectively subordinated to all debt and all other liabilities of our subsidiaries. 
 The Indenture does not limit the amount of senior or subordinated debt that we or our subsidiaries may incur either under the Indenture or other indentures, loan agreements or other instruments to which we or our subsidiaries become a party. The Notes are not convertible or exchangeable for our common stock or preferred stock. 
 Maturity Interest 
 The Notes will mature on March 17, 2027. The Notes bear interest at an annual rate equal to 4.500 . Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 17 and September 17 of each year to the persons in whose names the Notes are registered at the close of business on the preceding February 28 and August 31 of each year. Interest on the Notes at the maturity date will be payable to the persons to whom principal is payable. 
 Optional Redemption 
 The Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at our option at any time or from time to time on or after February 17, 2027 and are not subject to any sinking fund or similar provisions. The redemption price will be equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. 
 Mandatory Redemption 
 The Notes are not mandatorily redeemable at the option of the holders. 
 Subordination 
 The Notes are subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all of our senior indebtedness. 
 Events of Default and Defaults 
 Under the Indenture, our filing for bankruptcy and the occurrence of certain other events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating to Cullen Frost or the receivership of any major constituent bank (as defined in the Indenture) are defined as events of default . 
 Under the Indenture, the following are defined as defaults with respect to the Notes 
 failure to pay principal of or any premium on any note when due 
 failure to pay any interest on any note when due and that default continues for 30 days 
 failure to perform any other covenant in the indenture and that failure continues for 60 days after written notice to us by the trustee or the holders of at least 25 in aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes and 
 any event of default. 
 If an event of default occurs and is continuing, then the maturity of the Notes will automatically accelerate without any action by the trustee or the holders. After acceleration, but before a judgment or decree based on acceleration, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes may, under circumstances set forth in the Indenture, rescind the acceleration if we have deposited monies on account of certain overdue amounts with the trustee. 
 -6- 

If a default occurs that is not also an event of default, neither the trustee nor the holders may act to accelerate the maturity of the Notes. But if a default occurs, the trustee may proceed to enforce any covenant and other rights of the holders of the Notes. Furthermore, if the default relates to our failure to make any payment of interest due and payable and such default continues for 30 days or such default is made in the payment of the principal or any premium at its maturity, then the trustee may demand payment of the amounts then due and payable and may proceed to prosecute any failure on our part to make such payments. 
 Cullen Frost will furnish to the trustee annually a statement as to its performance of its obligations under the Indenture and as to any default in performance. 
 Modification of the Indenture 
 The following summarizes changes we can make to the Indenture and the Notes issued under the Indenture. 
 Changes Requiring Each Holder s Approval. First, there are changes that cannot be made without the approval of each holder of a Note affected by the change under the Indenture, including changes to the maturity for the principal or interest payment on a Note, reduction of the principal amount, the amount payable on acceleration of the maturity after a default, the interest rate or the redemption price for a Note, and impairment of any right a holder may have to require repayment of its Note. Refer to the Indenture for a full list of additional such changes. 
 Changes Not Requiring Approval. The second type of change does not require any approval by holders of the Notes. These changes are limited to clarifications and changes that would not adversely affect the Notes of that series in any material respect. Nor do we need any approval to make changes that affect only Notes to be issued under the Indenture after the changes take effect. 
 We may also make changes or obtain waivers that do not adversely affect a particular Note, even if they affect other debt securities that we may issue under the Indenture. In those cases, we do not need to obtain the approval of the holder of the unaffected debt security we need only obtain any required approvals from the holders of the affected debt securities. 
 Changes Requiring Super-Majority Approval. Any other change to the Indenture and the Notes issued under the Indenture would require certain super-majority approvals as described in the Indenture. 
 Actions Not Restricted by Indenture 
 The Indenture does not contain restrictions on our ability to 
 incur, assume or become liable for any type of debt or other obligation 
 create liens on our property for any purpose or 
 pay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock or repurchase or redeem our capital stock. 
 The Indenture does not require the maintenance of any financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. In addition, the Indenture does not contain any provisions that would require us to repurchase or redeem or modify the terms of any of the Notes upon a change of control or other event involving it that may adversely affect the creditworthiness of the Notes. 
 The Trustee 
 The Bank of New York Mellon is the indenture trustee. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the trustee, in case an event of default occurs and is continuing, the trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders, unless such holders have offered to the trustee reasonable indemnity. Subject to such provisions for the indemnification of the trustee, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee.
