PART I Item 1. BUSINESS General Development of Business ATEL 14, LLC (the Company or the Fund was formed under the laws of the state of California on April 1, 2009 Date of Inception for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities. The Managing Member of the Company is ATEL Managing Member, LLC (the Managing Member or Manager ), a Nevada limited liability company. Prior to May 9, 2011, the Manager was named ATEL Associates 14, LLC. The Managing Member is controlled by ATEL Financial Services, LLC AFS ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ATEL Capital Group. The Fund may continue until December 31, 2030. Contributions in the amount of 500 were received as of May 8, 2009, which represented the initial member s capital investment. As a limited liability company, the liability of any individual member for the obligations of the Fund is limited to the extent of capital contributions to the Fund by the individual member. The Company conducted a public offering of 15,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units Units ), at a price of 10 per Unit. As of December 2, 2009, subscriptions for the minimum number of Units (120,000, representing 1.2 million), excluding subscriptions from Pennsylvania investors, had been received and the Fund requested subscription proceeds to be released from escrow. On that date, the Company commenced initial operations and continued in its development stage activities until transitioning to an operating enterprise during the first quarter of 2010. Pennsylvania subscriptions are subject to a separate escrow and are released to the Fund only when aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least 7.5 million. Total contributions to the Fund exceeded 7.5 million on February 12, 2010, at which time a request was processed to release the Pennsylvania escrowed amounts. The offering was terminated on October 6, 2011. As of December 31, 2022, cumulative gross contributions, less rescissions and repurchases (net of distributions paid and allocated syndication costs, as applicable), totaling 83.5 million (inclusive of the 500 initial Member s capital investment) have been received. As of the same date, 8,246,919 Units were issued and outstanding. The Company s principal objectives are to invest in a diversified portfolio of investments that will (i) preserve, protect and return the Company s invested capital; (ii) generate regular cash distributions to Unitholders, with any balance remaining after required minimum distributions to be used to purchase additional investments during the Reinvestment Period (ending six calendar years after the completion of the Company s public offering of Units) and (iii) provide additional cash distributions following the Reinvestment Period and until all investment portfolio assets has been sold or otherwise disposed. The Company is governed by the ATEL 14, LLC amended and restated limited liability company operating agreement dated October 7, 2009 (the Operating Agreement ). On January 1, 2018, the Company commenced liquidation phase activities pursuant to the guidelines of the operating agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Operating Agreement, the Managing Member and/or its affiliates receives compensation for services rendered and reimbursements for costs incurred on behalf of the Company (See Note 6 to the financial statements included in Item 8 of this report). The Company is required to maintain reasonable cash reserves for working capital, the repurchase of Units and contingencies. The repurchase of Units is solely at the discretion of the Managing Member. Narrative Description of Business The Company had acquired various types of new and used equipment subject to leases and made loans secured by equipment acquired by its borrowers. The Company s primary investment objective was to acquire investments primarily in low-technology, low-obsolescence equipment such as the core operating equipment used by companies in the manufacturing, mining and transportation industries. A portion of the portfolio included some more technology-dependent equipment such as certain types of communications equipment, medical equipment, manufacturing equipment and office equipment. The Company sought equipment or financing of equipment and business involving green technologies such as those involved in the following activities: materials recycling, water purification, sewage treatment pollution radiation, gas and other emission treatment, solid waste management, renewable energy generation, as well as many other similar industries and activities.

The Company only purchases equipment under pre-existing leases or for which a lease was entered into concurrently at the time of the purchase. Through December 31, 2022, the Company had purchased equipment with a total acquisition price of 93.5 million. The Company had also funded investments in notes receivable totaling 12.2 million through December 31, 2022. As of the date of the final commitment of its proceeds from the sale of Units, the Company s objective was to have at least 75 of its investment portfolio (by cost) consist of equipment leased to lessees that the Manager deems to be high quality corporate credits and/or leases guaranteed by such high quality corporate credits. High quality corporate credits were lessees or guarantors who had a credit rating by Moody s Investors Service, Inc. of Baa3 or better, or the credit equivalent as determined by the Manager, or were public and private corporations with substantial revenues and histories of profitable operations, as well as established hospitals with histories of profitability or municipalities. The remaining 25 of the initial investment portfolio could include equipment lease transactions, real property single tenant net leases and other debt or equity financing for companies which, although deemed creditworthy by the Manager, would not satisfy the specific credit criteria for the portfolio described above. Included in this 25 of the portfolio may be growth capital financing investments. No more than 20 of the initial portfolio, by cost, consisted of these growth capital financing investments and no more than 20 of the portfolio, by cost, consisted of real estate investments. The Company s objective was to invest approximately 25 of its capital in assets that involved green technologies or applications as discussed above. The equipment financing industry is highly competitive. Equipment manufacturers, corporations, partnerships and others offer users an alternative to the purchase of most types of equipment with payment terms that vary widely depending on the type of financing, the lease or loan term and type of equipment. The ability of the Company to keep the equipment leased and the terms of purchase, lease and sale of equipment depends on various factors (many of which neither the Managing Member nor the Company can control), such as general economic conditions, including the effects of inflation or recession, and fluctuations in supply and demand for various types of equipment resulting from, among other things, technological and economic obsolescence. The Managing Member will use its best efforts to diversify lessees by geography and industry and to maintain an appropriate balance and diversity in the types of equipment acquired and the types of leases entered into by the Company, and will apply the following policies: (i) The Managing Member will seek to limit the amount invested in equipment or property leased to any single lessee to not more than 20 of the aggregate purchase price of investments as of the final commitment of net offering proceeds; (ii) in no event will the Company s equity equipment under operating leases or property leased to a single lessee exceed an amount equal to 20 of the maximum capital from the sale of Units (or 30,000,000); and (iii) the Managing Member will seek to invest not more than 20 of the aggregate purchase price of equipment in equipment acquired from a single manufacturer. However, this last limitation is a general guideline only, and the Company may acquire equipment from a single manufacturer in excess of the stated percentage during the offering period and before the offering proceeds are fully invested, or if the Managing Member deems such a course of action to be in the Company s best interest. The primary geographic region in which the Company seeks leasing opportunities is North America. All of the Company s current operating revenues and long-lived assets relate to customers domiciled in North America. The business of the Company is not seasonal. The Company has no full time employees. Employees of the Managing Member and affiliates provide the services the Company requires to effectively operate. The cost of these services is reimbursed by the Company to the Managing Member and affiliates per the Operating Agreement. For further information, refer to the financial statements and footnotes.

PART II Item 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Market Information There are certain material conditions and restrictions on the transfer of Units imposed by the terms of the Operating Agreement. Consequently, there is no public market for Units and it is not anticipated that a public market for Units will develop. In the absence of a public market for the Units, there is no currently ascertainable fair market value for the Units. Holders As of December 31, 2022, a total of 2,164 investors were Unitholders of record in the Company. Fund Valuation Background to Fund Valuation The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA ), in conjunction with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC updated rules for the presentation of account statement values relative to pricing of Direct Placement Program DPP shares. Under FINRA Notice 15-02 (the Notice the SEC approved amendments to National Association of Securities Dealers NASD Rule 2340, Customer Account Statements, and FINRA rule 2310, which address a FINRA member firm s participation in a public offering of a DPP. In summary, the amendments require a FINRA member firm to include in the account statements for customers holding DPP securities a per share value for the DPP. This per share value must be prepared by, or with the material assistance or confirmation of, a third-party valuation expert or service. The results of this valuation must be disclosed in the issuer s reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A valuation in compliance with the Notice must be undertaken and published on at least an annual basis. The effective date of the Notice was April 11, 2016. Methodologies Broker dealers are required to provide a per share estimated value on the customer account statements for each non-listed DPP security held by their customers. Such estimated value must have been developed in a manner reasonably designed to provide a reliable value. Two valuation methodologies have been defined by FINRA, which by such designation are presumed to be reliable. Net Investment Methodology The amendments to NASD Rule 2340(c)(1)(A) require net investment to be based on the amount available for investment percentage disclosed in the Estimated Use of Proceeds section of the issuer s offering prospectus. In essence, such value is equal to the offering price less selling commissions, other offering and organization expenses, and capital reserves. This method may be used for up to 150 days following the second anniversary of a Fund breaking escrow. Appraised Value Methodology As amended, Rule NASD 2340(c)(1)(B) requires that the per share estimated value disclosed in an issuer s most recent periodic or current report be based upon an appraisal of the assets and liabilities of the program by, or with the material assistance or confirmation of, a third-party valuation expert or service, in conformity with standard industry valuation practice as it relates to both the aforementioned assets and liabilities. No later than 150 days following the second anniversary of the issuer s break of escrow for its minimum offering, this methodology must be used to establish the required estimated values.

Unit Valuation The per Unit valuation estimate for ATEL 14, LLC has been conducted, and the results disclosed herein, in compliance with the mandates of the Notice. For ATEL 14, LLC , its estimated value per Unit reflects the Manager s estimate of current portfolio valuation of all assets and liabilities of the Fund, calculated on a per Unit basis, and as such, does not represent a market value for the Units and may not accurately reflect the value of the Fund Units to the Unit holders if held over time to Fund maturity. In connection with any estimate of per Unit value, Unit holders and all parties are reminded that no public market for the Units exists. Additionally, in order to preserve the Fund s pass-through status for federal income tax purposes, the Fund will not permit a secondary market or the substantial equivalent of a secondary market for the Units. In the absence of a public market for the Units, there is no currently ascertainable fair market value for the Units. The estimate of per Unit value does not take into account any extraordinary potential future business activity of the Fund; rather the valuation represents a snapshot view of the Fund s portfolio as of the valuation date. In addition, the Fund does not include any analysis of the distributions that have already been paid by the Fund, nor the anticipated returns to Unit holder over the full course of the Fund life cycle, which will be dependent on many factors. Disclosure The estimated value per Unit reported in this Form 10-K has been calculated using the Appraised Value Methodology described above under Methodologies above, as of December 31, 2022. ATEL 14, LLC , will satisfy the disclosure requirements for providing estimated per Unit values pursuant to the Notice as follows: For these disclosures, subsequent to the Fund s initial compliance with FINRA 15-02, annual disclosures of estimated per Unit values, through the termination of the Fund, will be accomplished and included on an annual basis in a document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission available to the public. Specifics Underlying Valuation Methodology: Notes and Explanation of Valuation Components and Calculation A. Fund Assets and Liabilities (other than as specifically identified below) : The estimated values for non-interest bearing items such as current assets and liabilities are assumed to equal their reported GAAP balances as an appropriate approximation of their fair values. Debt (interest bearing) is assumed to equal the fair values of the debt as disclosed in the footnotes of the financial statements. B. Investment in equipment and leases (net of fees and expenses) : The estimated values for equipment are based on calculating the present value of the projected future cash flows. Projected future cash flows include both the remaining contractual lease payments, plus assumptions on lease renewals and sale value of the residuals. Projected future cash flows are net of projected future fees and expenses including: 
 management fees applicable for the Fund (4.00 of revenue)
 carried interest applicable for the Fund (7.50 of distributions)
 operating expenses which are assumed to be 3 of original equipment costs for the Fund
 Projected future cash flows have been discounted back to present value at discount rates based on like-term U.S. Treasury yields (as of the valuation date) plus a 400 basis point spread, to account for the credit risk differentials between the instrument being valued and U.S. Treasury security yields. 
 8 

Residual values assumptions used in the cash flow projections are as follows: For On-Lease and Month-to-Month Lease : Considers realized residual as a percent of book residual of 168.7 , based on ATEL s historical track record as of December 31, 2022. For Off-Lease : Assumes current fair market value of off-lease equipment based on estimates from ATEL s seasoned Asset Management Group. Special Situation Leases : The valuation of certain leases has been performed outside of the above noted protocol based upon specific lease assumptions different than the macro assumptions above, due to the specific situations of those leases. C. Investments in Notes Receivable : The estimated values for Investments in Notes Receivable are estimated based upon various methodologies deployed by financial and credit management including, but not limited to, credit analysis, third party appraisal and/or discounted cash flow analysis based upon current market value techniques and market rates for similar types of lending arrangements, which may consider adjustments for impaired loans as deemed necessary. D. Investments in Equity Securities : The estimated values for Investments in Equity Securities have been based on the estimated net book value as of the valuation date (with impairment adjustments), plus any unrealized gain on equity. The unrealized gain on equity is based on either: a) the most recent round of financing, b) the most recent 409A valuation provided by the underlying companies of the warrants, or c) the Manager s estimate of the company valuations based on all available information, including company financials, company valuation reports, public press releases, and other sources. E. Warrants Outstanding : The estimated values for Warrants Outstanding considers the reported GAAP balances to be an appropriate approximation of their fair values. F. Accrued distributions : Accrued distributions, which are payable to the Unit holders have been removed from the balance sheet liability section because they are not a liability to a third party. 
 ATEL 14, LLC Unit Valuation The Manager s estimated per Unit value of ATEL 14, LLC at December 31, 2022 as determined, and derived under the guidelines of the Appraised Value Methodology, and pursuant to the above specific enumerated component valuation methodologies and calculations, equals 1.69. An independent national public accounting firm with valuation expertise was retained to examine, attest and confirm ATEL 14, LLC s per Unit valuation and its component methodologies and calculation as it relates to compliance with the regulatory mandate defined in the Notice. In this regard, they examined the components of the valuation methodologies and determined them to be reasonable and within industry standards. Other component attributes, including the bases and related key assumptions of the calculation were tested for their completeness, underlying documentation support and mathematical accuracy. Upon completion of their efforts, their attestation report confirmed that the per unit valuation of ATEL 14, LLC, and the related notes, in all material respects, was based upon industry practice as described in the Manager s valuation approach. Disclaimer The foregoing Fund per Unit valuation has been performed solely for the purpose of providing an estimated value per Unit in accordance with a regulatory mandate, in order to provide the broker dealer and custodian community with a valuation on a reasonable and attested basis for use in assigning an estimation of a Unit holder s account value. Any report or disclosure of such estimated per Unit valuation is to be accompanied by statements that the value does not represent an estimate of the amount a Unit holder would receive if the Unit holder were to seek to sell the Units, and that the Fund intends to liquidate its assets in the ordinary course of its business and over the Fund s term. Further, each statement of the Fund s estimated per Unit valuation is to be accompanied by a disclosure that there can be no assurance as to (1) when the Fund will be fully liquidated, (2) the amount the Fund may actually receive if and when the Fund seeks to liquidate its assets, (3) the amount of lease or loan payments the Fund will actually receive over the remaining 
 9 

term, (4) the amount of asset disposition proceeds the Fund will actually receive over the remaining term, and (5) the amounts that may actually be received in distributions by Unit holders over the course of the remaining term. Distributions The Unitholders of record are entitled to certain distributions as provided under the Operating Agreement. The Company commenced periodic distributions beginning with the month of December 2009. The monthly distributions were discontinued in 2018 as the Company entered its liquidation phase. The rates and frequency of periodic distributions paid by the Fund during its liquidation phase are solely at the discretion of the Managing Member. Distributions may be characterized for tax, accounting and economic purposes as a return of capital, a return on capital (including escrow interest) or a portion of each. Generally, the portion of each cash distribution by a company which exceeds its net income for the fiscal period would constitute a return of capital. The Fund is required by the terms of its Operating Agreement to distribute the net cash flow generated by its investments in certain minimum amounts during the Reinvestment Period before it can reinvest its operating cash flow in additional portfolio assets. See the discussion in the ATEL 14, LLC Prospectus dated October 7, 2009 Prospectus under Income, Losses and Distributions Reinvestment.

Item 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA A smaller reporting company is not required to present selected financial data in accordance with item 301(c) of Regulation S-K. Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Statements contained in this Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, which are not historical facts, may be forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. In particular, economic recession and changes in general economic conditions, including fluctuations in demand for equipment, lease rates, and interest rates, may result in delays in investment and reinvestment, delays in leasing, re-leasing, and disposition of equipment, and reduced returns on invested capital. The Company s performance is subject to risks relating to lessee defaults and the creditworthiness of its lessees. The Company s performance is also subject to risks relating to the value of its equipment at the end of its leases, which may be affected by the condition of the equipment, technological obsolescence and the markets for new and used equipment at the end of lease terms. Investors are cautioned not to attribute undue certainty to these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-K or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, other than as required by law. Overview ATEL 14, LLC (the Company or the Fund was formed under the laws of the state of California on April 1, 2009 Date of Inception for the purpose of equipment financing and acquiring equipment to engage in equipment leasing and sales activities. The Company conducted a public offering of 15,000,000 Limited Liability Company Units Units ), at a price of 10 per Unit. As of December 2, 2009, subscriptions for the minimum number of Units (120,000, representing 1.2 million), excluding subscriptions from Pennsylvania investors, had been received and the Fund requested subscription proceeds to be released from escrow. On that date, the Company commenced initial operations and continued in its development stage activities until transitioning to an operating enterprise during the first quarter of 2010. Pennsylvania subscriptions are subject to a separate escrow and are released to the Fund only when aggregate subscriptions for all investors equal to at least 7.5 million. Total contributions to the Fund exceeded 7.5 million on February 12, 2010, at which time a request was processed to release the Pennsylvania escrowed amounts. The offering was terminated on October 6, 2011 with a total of 8,402,515 Units subscribed, representing contributions, net of rescissions and repurchases, approximating 83.5 million. As of December 31, 2022, 8,246,919 Units were issued and outstanding. During 2011, the Company completed its initial acquisition stage with the investment of the net proceeds from the public offering of Units. Subsequently, during the reinvestment period Reinvestment Period (defined as six full years following the year the offering was terminated), the Company has reinvested cash flow in excess of certain amounts required to be distributed to the Other Members and/or utilized its credit facilities to acquire additional equipment. Throughout the Reinvestment Period, which ended December 31, 2017, the Company continued reinvestment of cash flow in excess of minimum distributions and other obligations. The Company is governed by its Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement Operating Agreement ), as amended. On January 1, 2018, the Company commenced liquidation phase activities pursuant to the guidelines of the Operating Agreement. The Company may continue until December 31, 2030. Periodic distributions are paid at the discretion of the Managing Member.

It is the Company s objective to maintain a 100 utilization rate for all equipment purchased in any given year. All equipment transactions are acquired subject to binding lease commitments, so equipment utilization is expected to remain high during the funding period and throughout the reinvestment stage. Initial lease terms of these leases are generally from 36 to 84 months, and as they expire, the Company will attempt to re-lease or sell the equipment. All of the Company s equipment on lease was purchased in the years 2009 through 2015, with capital improvements made during 2020. The utilization percentage of existing assets under lease was 98 and 97 for the years ended at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cost reimbursements to the Managing Member and/or affiliates are based on its costs incurred in performing administrative services for the Company. These costs are allocated to each managed entity based on certain criteria such as total assets, number of investors or contributed capital based upon the type of cost incurred. Results of Operations The Company had net income of 91 thousand and a net loss of 1.4 million for the respective years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Compared to prior year, the results for 2022 reflect a slight increase in total operating revenues, a significant decrease in total operating expenses, and an unfavorable change in other (loss) income related to the Company s investment in securities and warrants. Revenues T o tal o p erati n g re v en u es increased by 35 thousand primarily as a result of a 278 thousand increase in gains recognized on lease asset sales partially offset by a 246 thousand decrease in operating lease revenues . Th e increase in gains recognized on sales of lease asset s was m o stly attr i bu ted t o a c h an g e i n t h e mix of assets so l d; while the reduction in operating lease revenues was l a rgely due to run- o ff a nd dispositions of lease a s sets since December 31, 2021. Expenses T o tal o p erati n g ex p enses declined by 1.5 million mostly due t o decreases in impairment losses on equipment, depreciation expense, railcar maintenance costs, freight and shipping fees, storage fees, and cost reimbursement to Managing Member and affiliates. Impairment losses on equipment decreased by 671 thousand as adjustments of the same amount were recorded during the prior year to reduce the carrying value of certain assets deemed impaired. No such impairments were deemed necessary during 2022. Depreciation expense decreased by 444 thousand primarily due to a 408 thousand decrease in additional depreciation recorded to reflect year-to-date changes in estimated residual values of certain equipment generating revenue under month-to-month extensions, and the impact of portfolio run-off and disposition of lease assets. Railcar maintenance costs decreased by 117 thousand due to a reduction in lease-end repairs. In addition, freight and shipping costs, and storage fees declined by 110 thousand and 81 thousand, respectively, due to decreases in railcar returns and off-lease railcar inventory, and cost reimbursements to the Manager and/or affiliates decreased by 58 thousand as a result of lower allocated costs reflective of the Fund s declining assets. Other (loss) income During 2022, the Company also recorded other losses totaling 8 thousand related to the fair valuation of its investment securities and warrants. This compares to other income of 39 thousand recorded on such assets during the prior year. Such other losses for 2022 and other income for 2021 include 8 thousand of unrealized losses and 26 thousand of net unrealized gains, respectively. The unfavorable change can be attributed to a prior year adjustment, which increased unrealized gains on certain private equity securities by 58 thousand based on changes in observable prices. Also included in the other income recorded for the prior year was 13 thousand of gains realized from the sale of equity securities. There were no such sales during the current year.

Capital Resources and Liquidity At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company s cash and cash equivalents totaled 962 thousand and 1.7 million, respectively. The liquidity of the Company varies, increasing to the extent cash flows from leases and proceeds of asset sales exceed expenses and decreasing as distributions are made to the Members and to the extent expenses exceed cash flows from leases and proceeds from asset sales. The Company currently believes it has adequate reserves available to meet its immediate cash requirements and those of the next twelve months, but in the event those reserves were found to be inadequate, the Company would likely be in a position to borrow against its current portfolio to meet such requirements. Cash Flows The following table sets forth summary cash flow data (in thousands): 

2022 2021 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 1,143 963 Investing activities 566 1,795 Financing activities (2,495) (1,919) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents (786) 839 During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company s primary source of liquidity were cash flows from its portfolio of operating lease contracts. In addition, during the same respective years, the Company received 566 thousand and 1.6 million of proceeds from sales of lease assets. During 2021, the Company also received 239 thousand of proceeds from the sales of investment in equity securities. There were no such sales during the current year. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, cash was primarily used to pay distributions, and to repay borrowings under non-recourse debt. Distributions paid to the Other Members and the Managing Member totaled 1.5 million and 974 thousand for the respective years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021; while cash used to reduce non-recourse debt totaled 979 thousand and 945 thousand for the same respective years. Cash was also used to pay invoices related to management fees and expenses, and other payables during both years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Non-Recourse Long-Term Debt As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had non-recourse long-term debt totaling 1.2 million and 2.2 million, respectively. Such non-recourse notes payable do not contain any material financial covenants. The notes are secured by a specific lien granted by the Company to the non-recourse lenders on (and only on) the discounted lease transactions. The lenders have recourse only to the following collateral: the leased equipment; the related lease chattel paper; the lease receivables; and proceeds of the foregoing items. For detailed information on the Company s non-recourse debt, see Note 7 to the financial statements as set forth in Part II, Item 7, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Distributions The Company commenced periodic distributions beginning with the month of December 2009. Additional distributions have been consistently made through December 31, 2022. See Item 5, Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, for additional information regarding the distributions. Commitments and Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Transactions Commitments and Contingencies At December 31, 2022, there were no commitments to purchase lease assets and fund investments in notes receivable.

Assets which are re-leased continue to be depreciated using the terms of the new lease agreements and the estimated residual values at the end of the new lease terms, adjusted downward as necessary.

Any reimbursable costs incurred by AFS and/or affiliates during the year exceeding the annual and/or cumulative limits cannot be reimbursed in the current year, though such costs may be reimbursable in future years to the extent such amounts may be payable if within the annual and cumulative limits in such future years. The Fund is a finite life and self-liquidating entity, and AFS and its affiliates have no recourse against the Fund for the amount of any unpaid excess reimbursable administrative expenses. The Fund will continue to require administrative services from AFS and its affiliates through the end of its term, and will therefore continue to incur reimbursable administrative expenses in each year. The Fund has determined that payment of any amounts in excess of the annual and cumulative limits is not probable, and the date any portion of such amount may be paid, if ever, is uncertain. When the Fund completes its liquidation stage and terminates, any unpaid amount will expire unpaid, with no claim by AFS or its affiliates against any liquidation proceeds or any party for the unpaid balance. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has not exceeded the annual and/or cumulative limitations discussed above. per annum. The note is secured by assignments of lease payments and pledges of assets. At December 31, 2022, gross operating lease rentals totaled approximately million; and the carrying value of the pledged assets is million. The non-recourse debt does not contain any material financial covenants. The debt is secured by a specific lien granted by the Company to the non-recourse lender on (and only on) the discounted lease transactions. The lender has recourse only to the following collateral: the leased equipment; the related lease chattel paper; the lease receivables; and proceeds of the foregoing items. The non-recourse obligation is payable solely out of the respective specific security and the Company does not guarantee (nor is the Company otherwise contractually responsible for) the payment of the non-recourse debt as a general obligation or liability of the Company. Although the Company does not have any direct or general liability in connection with the non-recourse debt apart from the security granted, the Company is directly and generally liable and responsible for certain representations, warranties, and covenants made to the lender, such as warranties as to genuineness of the transaction parties signatures, as to the genuineness of the respective lease chattel paper or the transaction as a whole, or as to the Company s good title to or perfected interest in the secured collateral, as well as similar representations, warranties and covenants typically provided by non-recourse borrowers and customary in the equipment finance industry, and are viewed by such industry as being consistent with non-recourse discount financing obligations. Accordingly, as there are no financial covenants or ratios imposed on the Company in connection with the non-recourse debt, the Company has determined that there are no material covenants with respect to the non-recourse debt that warrant footnote disclosure.

The Managing Member s disclosure controls and procedures, as they are applicable to the Company, means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq. is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

The internal control process of the Managing Member, as it is applicable to the Company, was designed to provide reasonable assurance to Management regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements, and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, and that the Company s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of the Management of the Managing Member; and (2) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. All internal control processes, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those processes determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the reliability of financial statement preparation and presentation. Further, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management of the Managing Member assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, as it is applicable to the Company, as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Code of Ethics A Code of Ethics that is applicable to the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer of its Manager, ATEL Managing Member, LLC, or persons acting in such capacity on behalf of the Company, is included as Exhibit 14.1 to this report. Item 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION The registrant has no officers or directors. Set forth hereinafter is a description of the nature of remuneration paid and to be paid to the Manager and its affiliates. The amount of such remuneration paid for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is set forth in Item 8 of this report under the caption Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Financial Statements - Related party transactions, at Note 6 thereof, which information is hereby incorporated by reference. Asset Management Fee and Carried Interest The Company pays the Manager an annual Asset Management Fee in an amount equal to 4 of Gross Operating Lease Revenues and Cash from Sales or Refinancing. The Asset Management Fee is paid on a monthly basis. The amount of the Asset Management Fee payable in any year is reduced for that year to the extent it would otherwise exceed the Asset Management Fee Limit, as described below. The Asset Management Fee is paid for services rendered by the Manager and its affiliates in determining portfolio and investment strategies and generally managing or supervising the management of the investment portfolio. The Manager supervises performance of all management activities, including, among other activities: the acquisition and financing of the investment portfolio, collection of lease and loan revenues, monitoring compliance by lessees borrowers with their contract terms, assuring that investment assets are being used in accordance with all operative contractual arrangements, paying operating expenses and arranging for necessary maintenance and repair of equipment and property in the event a lessee fails to do so, monitoring property, sales and use tax compliance and preparation of operating financial data. The Manager intends to delegate all or a portion of its duties and the Asset Management Fee to one or more of its affiliates who are in the business of providing such services. The Manager also receives, as its Carried Interest, an amount equal to 7.5 of all Company Distributions. 
 37 

Limitations on Fees The Fund has adopted a single Asset Management Fee plus the Carried Interest as a means of compensating the Manager for sponsoring the Fund and managing its operations. While this compensation structure is intended to simplify management compensation for purposes of investor s understanding, state securities administrators use a more complicated compensation structure in their review of equipment program offerings in order to assure that those offerings are fair under the states merit review guidelines. The total of all Front End Fees, the Carried Interest and the Asset Management Fee will be subject to the Asset Management Fee Limit in order to assure these state administrators that the Fund will not bear greater fees than permitted under the state merit review guidelines. The North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. NASAA is an organization of state securities administrators, those state government agencies responsible for qualifying securities offerings in their respective states. NASAA has established standards for the qualification of a number of different types of securities offerings and investment products, including its Statement of Policy on Equipment Programs (the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines ). Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines establish the standards for payment of reasonable carried interests, promotional interests and fees for equipment acquisition, management, resale and releasing services to equipment leasing program sponsors. Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines set the maximum compensation payable to the sponsor and its affiliates from an equipment leasing program such as the Fund. The Asset Management Fee Limit will equal the maximum compensation payable under Article IV, Sections C through G of the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines as in effect on the date of the Fund s prospectus (the NASAA Fee Limitation ). Under the Asset Management Fee Limit, the Fund will calculate the maximum fees payable under the NASAA Fee Limitation and guarantee that the Asset Management Fee it will pay the Manager and its Affiliates, when added to its Carried Interest, will never exceed the fees and interests payable to a sponsor and its affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation. Asset Management Fee Limit. The Asset Management Fee Limit will be calculated each year during the Fund s term by calculating the total fees that would be paid to the Manager if the Manager were to be compensated on the basis of the maximum compensation payable under the NASAA Fee Limitation, including the Manager s Carried Interest, as described below. To the extent that the amount paid as Front End Fees, the Asset Management Fee, and the Carried Interest for any year would cause the total fees to exceed the aggregate amount of fees calculated under the NASAA Fee Limitation for the year, the Asset Management Fee and/or Carried Interest for that year will be reduced to equal the maximum aggregate fees under the NASAA Fee Limitation. To the extent any such fees are reduced, the amount of such reduction will be accrued and deferred, and such accrued and deferred compensation would be paid to the Manager in a subsequent period, but only to the extent that the deferred compensation would be within the Asset Management Fee Limit for that later period. Any deferred fees that cannot be paid under the applicable limitations through the date of liquidation would be forfeited by the Manager at liquidation. Under the NASAA Equipment Leasing Guidelines, the Fund is required to commit a minimum percentage of the Gross Proceeds to Equipment under Operating Leases, calculated as the greater of: (i) 80 of the Gross Proceeds reduced by 0.0625 for each 1 of indebtedness encumbering the Fund s equipment; or (ii) 75 of such Gross Proceeds. The Fund intends to incur total indebtedness equal to 50 of the aggregate cost of its equipment. The Operating Agreement requires the Fund to commit at least 85.875 of the Gross Proceeds to Equipment under Operating Leases. Based on the formula in the NASAA Guidelines, the Fund s minimum Equipment under Operating Leases would equal 76.875 of Gross Proceeds (80 - [50 x .0625 ] = 76.875 ), and the Fund s minimum Equipment under Operating Leases would therefore exceed the NASAA Fee Limitation minimum by 9 . 
 38 

The amount of the Carried Interest permitted the Manager under the NASAA Fee Limitation will be dependent on the amount by which the percentage of Gross Proceeds the Fund ultimately commits to Equipment under Operating Leases exceeds the minimum Equipment under Operating Leases under the NASAA Fee Limitation. The NASAA Fee Limitation permits the Manager and its Affiliates to receive compensation in the form of a carried interest in Fund Net Income, Net Loss and Distributions equal to 1 for the first 2.5 of excess Equipment under Operating Leases over the NASAA Guidelines minimum, 1 for the next 2 of such excess, and 1 for each additional 1 of excess Equipment under Operating Leases. With a minimum Equipment under Operating Leases of 85.875 , the Manager and its Affiliates may receive an additional carried interest equal to 6.5 of Net Profit, Net Loss and Distributions under the foregoing formula (2.5 + 2 + 4.5 = 9 ; 1 + 1 + 4.5 = 6.5 ). At the lowest permitted level of Equipment under Operating Leases, the NASAA Guidelines would permit the Manager and its Affiliates to receive a promotional interest equal to 5 of Distributions of Cash from Operations and 1 of Distributions of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds until Members have received total Distributions equal to their Original Invested Capital plus an 8 per annum cumulative return on their Adjusted Invested Capital, and, thereafter, the promotional interest may increase to 15 of all Distributions. With the additional carried interest calculated as described above, the maximum aggregate fees payable to the Manager and Affiliates under the NASAA Guidelines as carried interest and promotional interest would equal 11.5 of Distributions of Cash from Operations (6.5 + 5 = 11.5 ), and 7.5 of Distributions of Sale or Refinancing Proceeds (6.5 + 1 = 7.5 ), before the subordination level was reached, and 21.5 of all Distributions thereafter. The maximum amounts to be paid under the terms of the Operating Agreement are subject to the application of the Asset Management Fee Limit provided in Section 8.3 of the Agreement, which limits the annual amount payable to the Manager and its Affiliates as the Asset Management Fee and the Carried Interest to an aggregate not to exceed the total amount of fees that would be payable to the Manager and its Affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation. Upon completion of the offering of Units, final commitment of offering proceeds to acquisition of equipment and establishment of final levels of permanent portfolio debt, the Manager will calculate the maximum carried interest and promotional interest payable to the Manager and its Affiliates under the NASAA Fee Limitation and compare such total permitted fees to the total of the Asset Management Fee and Manager s Carried Interest. If and to the extent that the Asset Management Fee and Manager s Carried Interest would exceed the fees calculated under the NASAA Fee Limitation, the fees payable to the Manager and its Affiliates will be reduced by an amount sufficient to cause the total of such compensation to comply with the NASAA Fee Limitation. The adjusted Asset Management Fee Limit will then be applied to the Asset Management Fee and Carried Interest as described above. A comparison of the Front End Fees actually paid by the Fund and the NASAA Fee Limitation maximums will be repeated, and any required adjustments will be made, at least annually thereafter. See Note 6 to the financial statements as set forth in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for amounts paid.

Exhibit 14.1 ATEL 14, LLC CODE OF ETHICS FOR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL AND OPERATING OFFICER A. SCOPE This Code of Ethics is applicable to ATEL 14, LLC Fund 14 ), including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer of its Manager, ATEL Managing Member, LLC AMM ), or persons acting in such capacity (collectively the Covered Officers on behalf of Fund 14, referred to herein as the Company. Accordingly, under the Securities and Exchange Commission s interpretation of its disclosure rules, the Board of Directors of the Manager of AMM, ATEL Financial Services, LLC AFS ), functions as the de facto audit committee for the Company with respect to all procedural and disclosure requirements applicable to audit committees under Securities and Exchange Commission rules. The Board of Directors shall have oversight responsibility over the activities of the Company for purposes of this Code of Ethics. B. PURPOSE The Company is proud of the values with which it conducts business. It has and will continue to uphold the highest levels of business ethics and personal integrity in all types of transactions and interactions. To this end, this Code of Ethics serves to (1) emphasize the Company s commitment to ethics and compliance with the law; (2) set forth basic standards of ethical and legal behavior; (3) provide reporting mechanisms for known or suspected ethical or legal violations; and (4) help prevent and detect wrongdoing. This Code of Ethics is intended to augment and supplement the standard of ethics and business conduct expected of all Company employees, and its limitation to Covered Officers is not intended to limit the obligation of all Company employees to adhere to the highest standards of business ethics and integrity in all transactions and interactions conducted while in the Company s employ. Given the variety and complexity of ethical questions that may arise in the course of business of the Company, this Code of Ethics serves only as a rough guide. Confronted with ethically ambiguous situations, the Covered Officers should remember the Company s commitment to the highest ethical standards and seek independent advice, where necessary, to ensure that all actions they take on behalf of the Company honor this commitment. C. ETHICS STANDARDS 1. Honest and Ethical Conduct The Covered Officers shall behave honestly and ethically at all times and with all people. They shall act in good faith, with due care, and shall engage only in fair and open competition, by treating ethically competitors, suppliers, customers, and colleagues. They shall not misrepresent facts or engage in illegal, unethical, or anti-competitive practices for personal or professional gain. 2. Conflicts of Interest This fundamental standard of honest and ethical conduct extends to the handling of conflicts of interest. The Covered Officers shall avoid any actual, potential, or apparent conflicts of interest with the Company, and any personal activities, investments, or associations that might give rise to such conflicts. They shall not compete with or use the Company, for personal gain, self-deal, or take advantage of any corporate opportunities. They shall act on behalf of the Company free from improper influence or the appearance of improper influence on their judgment or performance of duties. A Covered Officer shall disclose any material transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to such a conflict to the Company s General Counsel or a member of the Company s Board of Directors. No action may be taken with respect to such transaction or party unless and until the Company s Board of Directors has approved such action. 

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood, as fully disclosed in the offering documents for the Company, that AMM as managing member of the Company has certain inherent conflicts of interest. The provisions of the Company s Operating Agreement have been drafted to address the obligations, restrictions and limitations on the power and authority of AMM to manage the Company s affairs, including restrictions prohibiting or limiting the terms of any transactions in which conflicts of interest may arise. Furthermore, AMS has a fiduciary duty to the Company as its manager. It is therefore expressly understood by the Company and the Covered Officers that any and all actions by AMM and its personnel that comply with the provisions of the Company s Operating Agreement, and which are consistent with AMM s fiduciary duty to the Company, will not be considered material transactions or relationships which require disclosure or reporting under this Code of Ethics. 3. Timely and Truthful Disclosure In reports and documents filed with or submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators by the Company and in other public communications made by the Company, the Covered Officers shall make disclosures that are full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable. The Covered Officers shall provide thorough and accurate financial and accounting data for inclusion in such disclosures. The Covered Officers shall not knowingly conceal or falsify information, misrepresent material facts, or omit material facts necessary to avoid misleading the Company s independent public auditors or investors. 4. Legal Compliance In conducting the business of the Company, the Covered Officers shall comply with applicable governmental laws, rules, and regulations at all levels of government in the United States and in any non-U.S. jurisdiction in which the Company does business, as well as applicable rules and regulations of self-regulatory organizations of which the Company is a member. If the Covered Officer is unsure whether a particular action would violate an applicable law, rule, or regulation, he or she should seek the advice of inside counsel (if available), and, where necessary, outside counsel before undertaking it. D. VIOLATIONS OF ETHICAL STANDARDS 1. Reporting Known or Suspected Violations The Covered Officers will promptly bring to the attention of the Company s General Counsel or the Board of Directors any information concerning a material violation of any of the laws, rules or regulations applicable to the Company and the operation of its businesses, by the Company or any agent thereof, or of violation of this Code of Ethics. The Company s General Counsel will investigate reports of violations and the findings communicated to the Company s Board of Directors. 2. Accountability for Violations If the Company s Board of Directors determines that this Code of Ethics has been violated, either directly, by failure to report a violation, or by withholding information related to a violation, it may discipline the offending Covered Officer for non-compliance with penalties up to and including termination of employment. Violations of this Code of Ethics may also constitute violations of law and may result in criminal penalties and civil liabilities for the offending Covered Officer and the Company.
