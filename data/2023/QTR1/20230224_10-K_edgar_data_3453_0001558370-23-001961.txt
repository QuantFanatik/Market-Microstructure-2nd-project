 Fleet Renewal Program: Matson is constructing three new vessels with the following specifications and expected delivery dates: 

Usable Cargo Capacity Containers Maximum Maximum Type of Expected Reefer Speed Deadweight Class of Vessel Vessel Delivery Date TEUs Slots Length (Knots) (Long Tons) Aloha Class Containership Q4 2026 3,620 400 853 2 23.5 53,000 Aloha Class Containership Q2 2027 3,620 400 853 2 23.5 53,000 Aloha Class Containership Q4 2027 3,620 400 853 2 23.5 53,000 Upon delivery, Matson expects to deploy the three new vessels in the CLX service and redeploy three existing CLX vessels into the Alaska service. The new vessels will have dual-fuel engines and be equipped with tanks, piping and cryogenic equipment designed to operate on liquified natural gas LNG and conventional fuels. The new vessels are also being designed with state-of-the-art green technology features and fuel-efficient hulls. Each new vessel is expected to provide 500 containers of additional capacity per voyage in the CLX service. The contract cost of the new vessel program is approximately 1.0 billion in total, and milestone payments are expected to be financed with cash currently on deposit in the Company s Capital Construction Fund, cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet and through cash flows generated from future operations, borrowings available under the Company s unsecured revolving credit facility or additional debt financings . Actual and future annual vessel construction progress milestone payments based on signed agreements and change orders, excluding owners items and capitalized interest, are expected to be as follows: 

Paid Future Milestone Payments Vessel Construction Obligations (in millions) 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total Three Aloha Class Containerships 50.0 50.0 71.0 351.0 307.0 157.0 13.0 999.0 Matson is also installing tanks, piping and cryogenic equipment on existing Aloha Class vessels so that they can operate on LNG and conventional fuels. The LNG installation project on Daniel K. Inouye has begun and work on Kaimana Hila is currently scheduled to begin during the second quarter of 2024. Each installation is expected to cost approximately 35 million. Additionally, the Company plans to begin reengining Manukai to operate on LNG and conventional fuels during the second quarter of 2023 at a total cost of approximately 60 million. The three new Aloha Class vessels and LNG installation projects are important steps towards achieving Matson s medium-term greenhouse gas GHG emissions goal which is to reduce Scope 1 GHG emissions from our owned fleet by 40 by 2030, using 2016 as a baseline year. Matson has also set a long-term goal to achieve net zero Scope 1 GHG emissions from our owned fleet by 2050. For more information on Matson s environmental stewardship initiatives, including GHG reduction goals, see Matson s Sustainability Report and other information available at https://www.matson.com/sustainability. Vessel Emission Regulations: Being a leader in environmental stewardship is one of Matson s core values. Matson s vessels transit through some of the most environmentally sensitive areas in the United States including the Hawaiian Islands and the coasts of California, Oregon, Washington and Alaska. In particular, Matson is focused on reducing transportation emissions, including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, particulate matter and sulfur dioxide through improvements in vessel fuel consumption, choice of fuel types and the development of more fuel-efficient transportation solutions. Matson further contributes positively to the environment by testing and deploying leading technologies as the fleet is modernized. The International Maritime Organization IMO ), to which the U.S. and over 100 other countries are signatories, is a specialized agency of the United Nations that sets international environmental standards applicable to vessels operating under the flag of any signatory country. Effective January 1, 2020, the IMO imposed regulations that generally require all vessels to burn fuel oil with a maximum sulfur content of 0.5 percent. With respect to North America, all waters, with certain limited exceptions, within 200 nautical miles of U.S. and Canadian coastlines have been designated emission control areas ECAs ). Since January 1, 2015, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations have 
 5 

Table of Contents 
 reduced the fuel oil maximum sulfur content in designated ECAs. In addition, since August 1, 2012, the California Air Resource Board has reduced the fuel oil maximum sulfur content to 0.1 percent within 24 miles of the California coastline. All of Matson s vessels are designed to operate in compliance with IMO and ECA regulations as applicable. Matson also maintains vessels which may operate as dry-dock relief or for emergency activation purposes under an EPA approved ECA permit enabling the use of fuel oil with a maximum sulfur content of 0.5 percent within the North America ECA or at any time on IMO compliant fuels. In June 2021, the IMO adopted new GHG emission requirements applicable to ships. Beginning with a company s first annual, intermediate or renewal survey for an International Air Pollution Prevention IAPP certificate on or after January 1, 2023, all containerships with more than 10,000 dead weight tons will be required to meet specified Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index EEXI levels. EEXI is a one-time certification measuring a ship s theoretical carbon dioxide (CO 2 emissions per transport work based on its design parameters. Beginning in 2023, containerships with over 5,000 gross tonnage GT will be required to meet annual Carbon Intensity Indicator CII requirements that become increasingly stringent towards 2030. CII measures how efficiently a ship transports goods, and uses actual CO 2 emissions to determine an annual rating from A to E. For ships that achieve a D rating for three consecutive years or an E rating in a single year, a corrective action plan needs to be developed as part of the vessels Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan SEEMP and approved. For a discussion on the Company s planned future capital expenditures to comply with these regulations, see Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. For more information on Matson s environmental stewardship initiatives, including GHG emission reduction goals, see Matson s Sustainability Report and other information available at https://www.matson.com/sustainability. Hawaii Terminal Modernization and Expansion Program: Matson completed the first phase of its program to modernize and renovate its terminal facility at Sand Island, Honolulu, and is progressing on the second phase. As part of this program, Matson completed the installation of three new 65 long- ton capacity gantry cranes, upgraded and renovated three existing cranes, demolished four outdated cranes, and installed upgrades to the electrical infrastructure at the terminal. In addition, Matson completed the installation, energization and transition to a new redundant main switchgear. Additional projects for the second phase relate to improvements to its existing backup power generators, installation of new above ground fuel storage tanks, a battery energy storage system, and other upgrades at the terminal, and are expected to be completed within the next three years. The third phase represents a broader and long-term terminal expansion program at the Sand Island terminal facility. Matson expects to expand into Pier 51A and portions of Pier 51B after Pasha Hawaii Pasha relocates to the newly constructed Kapalama container terminal facility planned for 2024. From 2023 to 2024, Matson will be performing surveying, planning and design work in preparation for this expansion. Ocean Transportation Equipment: As a complement to its fleet of vessels, Matson owns a variety of equipment including cranes, terminal equipment, containers and chassis, which represents an investment of approximately 0.8 billion as of December 31, 2022. Matson also leases containers, chassis and other equipment under various operating lease agreements. Operating Costs: Major components of Matson s Ocean Transportation operating costs are as follows: Direct Cargo Expense includes terminal handling costs including labor, purchased outside transportation and other related costs. Vessel Operating Expense includes crew wages and related costs; fuel, pilots, tugs and line related costs; vessel charter expenses; and other vessel operating related expenses. Matson purchases fuel oil, lubricants and gasoline for its operations and pays fuel-related surcharges to other third-party transportation providers.

 Operating Overhead includes equipment repair costs, equipment lease and repositioning expenses, vessel repair and maintenance costs, depreciation and dry-docking amortization, insurance, port engineers and other maintenance costs, and other vessel and shoreside related overhead. Competition: The following is a summary of major competitors in Matson s Ocean Transportation segment: Hawaii Service: Matson s Hawaii service has one major U.S. flagged Jones Act competitor, Pasha, which operates container and roll-on/roll-off services between the ports of Long Beach, Oakland and San Diego, California to Hawaii. A U.S. flagged Jones Act barge operator, Aloha Marine Lines, also offers barge service between Seattle, Washington and Hawaii. Foreign-flagged vessels carrying cargo to Hawaii from non-U.S. locations also provide alternatives for companies shipping to Hawaii. Other competitors in the Hawaii service include proprietary operators and contract carriers of bulk cargo, and airfreight freight carriers. Matson operates three strings of vessels to Hawaii. These strings provide customers an industry-leading five departures from ports on the U.S. West Coast two each from Long Beach and Oakland, California and one from Tacoma, Washington, with three arrivals in Honolulu each week. Each of these strings operates on a fixed day-of-the-week schedule. One of the vessel strings continues from Honolulu to China before returning to Long Beach. Matson s frequent sailings and punctuality permit customers to reduce inventory carrying costs. Matson also competes by offering one of the most comprehensive services to customers, including: the only container service to and from the three largest U.S. West Coast ports; the most efficient terminal network on the U.S. West Coast with three exclusive use terminals provided by SSAT; a dedicated inter-island barge network which is integrated with Matson s line haul schedule; roll-on/roll-off service from Long Beach and Oakland; a world-class customer service team; and efficiency and experience in handling cargo of many types. Alaska Service: Matson s Alaska service has one major U.S. flagged Jones Act competitor, Totem Ocean Trailer Express, Inc., which operates a roll-on/roll off service between Tacoma, Washington and Anchorage, Alaska. There are also two U.S. flagged Jones Act barge operators, Alaska Marine Lines, which mainly provides services from Seattle, Washington to the ports of Anchorage, Dutch Harbor, and other locations in Alaska, and Samson Tug Barge, which mainly serves Western Alaska and other locations. The barge operators have historically shipped lower value commodities that can accommodate a longer transit time, as well as construction materials and other cargo that are not conducive to movement in containers. Foreign-flagged vessels provide alternatives for companies shipping cargo (mainly seafood) from the Alaska ports of Kodiak and Dutch Harbor to international destinations. Other competition includes air freight carriers and over-the-road trucking services. Matson s AAX service has two major competitors, CMA CGM and Maersk Lines, which provide services between Dutch Harbor, Alaska and Asia. Matson offers customers twice weekly scheduled service from Tacoma, Washington to Anchorage and Kodiak, Alaska, and a weekly service to Dutch Harbor, Alaska. The Company also provides a barge service between Dutch Harbor and Akutan in Alaska. Matson is the only Jones Act containership operator providing service to Kodiak and Dutch Harbor in Alaska, which are the primary loading ports for southbound seafood. Matson offers dedicated terminal services at the Alaska ports of Anchorage, Kodiak and Dutch Harbor performed by Matson, and at the port of Tacoma, Washington performed by SSAT. Matson s AAX service also offers customers a service from Kodiak and Dutch Harbor, Alaska to Ningbo and Shanghai, China, and Busan, South Korea, with transshipment services from those ports to other locations in Asia. China Service: Major competitors to Matson s China service include large international transpacific carriers such as CMA CGM, OOCL, ZIM, Evergreen and Maersk. Other competition includes air freight carriers. Matson s China service (CLX and CLX+) competes by offering fast and reliable service from the ports of Ningbo and Shanghai in China, and feeder services from other Asian ports of origin, to Long Beach and Oakland, California. Matson provides fixed day-of-the-week arrivals and industry leading cargo availability. Matson s service is further differentiated by best-in-class stevedoring services provided by SSAT, Matson dedicated terminal space, access to Shippers Transport Express off-dock container yards for faster truck turn times, Matson-dedicated equipment including chassis to speed cargo availability, one-stop intermodal connections, and world-class customer service. Matson also

 provides intermodal services in coordination with Matson Logistics. Matson has offices located in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Ningbo and Hong Kong, and has contracted with terminal operators in Ningbo and Shanghai. Guam Service: Matson s Guam service has one major competitor, APL, a U.S. flagged subsidiary of CMA CGM, which operates a U.S. flagged container service connecting the U.S. West Coast to Guam and Saipan, via transshipments to U.S. flagged feeder vessels in Yokohama, Japan and Busan, South Korea via a two-ship feeder service. There are also other several foreign carriers that call at Guam from foreign origin ports, and air freight carriers. Matson offers customers a weekly service to Guam as part of the CLX service from three ports on the U.S. West Coast. Matson s ocean transit time, frequent sailing and reliable on-time performance provides an industry-leading service to its customers. Japan Service: Matson s Japan service has one major competitor, APL, which operates a U.S. flagged containership service from the U.S. West Coast to the port of Naha in Okinawa, Japan. Matson offers customers a weekly service to the port of Naha in Okinawa, Japan as part of the CLX service from three ports on the U.S. West Coast. Micronesia and South Pacific Services: Matson s Micronesia and South Pacific services have competition from a variety of local and international carriers that provide freight services to the area. Customer Concentration: Matson serves customers in numerous industries and carries a wide variety of cargo, mitigating its dependence upon any single customer or single type of cargo. The Company s 10 largest Ocean Transportation customers account for approximately 15 percent of the Company s Ocean Transportation revenue. For additional information on Ocean Transportation revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below. Seasonality: Historically, Matson s Ocean Transportation services have typically experienced seasonality in volume, generally following a pattern of increasing volume starting in the second quarter of each year, culminating in a peak season throughout the third quarter, with subsequent decline in demand during the fourth and first quarters. This seasonality trend is amplified in the Alaska service primarily due to winter weather and the timing of southbound seafood trade. As a result, earnings have tended to follow a similar pattern, offset by periodic vessel dry-docking and other episodic cost factors, which can lead to earnings variability. In addition, in the China trade, volume is typically driven primarily by U.S. consumer demand for goods during key retail selling seasons. Freight rates are impacted mainly by macro supply and demand variables. Matson s typical seasonal trends have been impacted by the global pandemic which resulted in elevated levels of demand experienced in our Ocean Transportation services during the second half of 2020 throughout 2021 and in the first half of 2022. Weakening economic conditions in the U.S., relatively high inflation and the impact of higher interest rates on household discretionary income may affect the demand for consumer goods in our markets, which could impact seasonal variability and demand for the Company s Ocean Transportation services in 2023. Maritime Laws and the Jones Act : Maritime Laws: All interstate and intrastate marine commerce within the U.S. falls under the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (commonly referred to as the Jones Act). The Jones Act is a long-standing cornerstone of U.S. maritime policy. Under the Jones Act, all vessels transporting cargo between covered U.S. ports must, subject to limited exceptions, be built in the U.S., registered under the U.S. flag, be manned predominantly by U.S. crews, and owned and operated by U.S.-organized companies that are controlled and 75 percent owned by U.S. citizens. U.S. flagged vessels are generally required to be maintained at higher standards than foreign-flagged vessels and are subject to rigorous supervision and inspections by, or on behalf of, the U.S. Coast Guard, which requires appropriate certifications and background checks of the crew members. Under Section 27 of the Jones 
 8 

Table of Contents 
 Act, the carriage of cargo between the U.S. West Coast, Hawaii and Alaska on foreign-built or foreign-documented vessels is prohibited. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, approximately 39 percent, 41 percent and 62 percent, respectively, of Matson s Ocean Transportation revenues came from the Hawaii and Alaska trades that were subject to the Jones Act. Matson s Hawaii and Alaska trade routes are included within the non-contiguous Jones Act market. The commerce of both Hawaii, as an island economy, and Alaska, due to its geographical location, are dependent on ocean transportation. The Jones Act ensures frequent, reliable, roundtrip service to these locations. Matson s vessels operating in these trade routes are Jones Act qualified and maintained in compliance with such requirements. Matson is a member of the American Maritime Partnership AMP ), which supports the retention of the Jones Act and similar cabotage laws. The Jones Act has broad support from both houses of Congress and the Executive Branch. Matson believes that the geopolitical environment has further solidified political support for U.S. flagged vessels because a vital and dedicated U.S. merchant marine is a cornerstone for a strong homeland defense, as well as a critical source of trained U.S. mariners for wartime support. AMP seeks to inform elected officials and the public about the economic, national security, commercial, safety and environmental benefits of the Jones Act and similar cabotage laws. Repeal of the Jones Act would allow foreign-flagged vessel operators that do not have to abide by all U.S. laws and regulations to sail between U.S. ports in direct competition with Matson and other U.S. domestic operators that must comply with all such laws and regulations. Other U.S. maritime laws require vessels operating between Guam, a U.S. territory, and U.S. ports to be U.S. flagged and predominantly U.S. crewed, but not U.S. built. Cabotage laws are not unique to the United States, and similar laws exist around the world in over 90 countries, including regions in which Matson provides ocean transportation services. Any changes in such laws may have an impact on the services provided by Matson in those regions. Rate Regulations and Fuel-Related Surcharges: Matson is subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board with respect to its domestic ocean rates. A rate in the non-contiguous domestic trade is presumed reasonable and will not be subject to investigation if the aggregate of increases and decreases is not more than 7.5 percent above, or more than 10 percent below, the rate in effect one year before the effective date of the proposed rate, subject to increase or decrease by the percentage change in the U.S. Producer Price Index. Matson generally seeks to provide a 30-day notice to customers of any increases in general rates and other charges, and passes along decreases as soon as possible. Matson s Ocean Transportation services engaged in U.S.-foreign commerce are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Maritime Commission FMC ). The FMC is a federal independent regulatory agency that is responsible for the regulation of international ocean-borne transportation to and from the U.S. Matson applies a fuel-related surcharge rate to its Ocean Transportation customers. Matson s fuel-related surcharge is correlated to market rates for fuel prices and other factors, and is intended to help Matson recover fuel-related expenses . Other Environmental Regulations: In addition to the vessel emission regulations discussed above, Matson s operations are required to comply with other environmental regulations and requirements including the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation Liability Act of 1980, the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, the Clean Water Act, the Invasive Species Act and the Clean Air Act. Matson is also subject to state regulations affecting terminal and vessel emissions, such as the requirement to shut down vessel generator engines while at berth at California ports and switch to shore electrical power or achieve equivalent emissions reductions. The Company actively monitors its operations for compliance with these and other regulations. For more information on Matson s environmental stewardship initiatives, including its environmental goals, see Matson s Sustainability Report and other information available at https://www.matson.com/sustainability.

 (2) LOGISTICS SEGMENT Logistics Services: Matson Logistics provides the following services: Transportation Brokerage Services: Matson Logistics provides intermodal rail, highway, and other third-party logistics services for North American customers and international ocean carrier customers, including MatNav. Matson Logistics creates award winning benefits and value for its customers through volume purchases of rail, motor carrier and ocean transportation services, augmented by services such as shipment tracking and tracing, accessibility to its private fleet of 53-foot intermodal containers and single-vendor invoicing. Matson Logistics operates customer service centers and has sales offices throughout North America. Freight Forwarding Services: Matson Logistics provides LCL consolidation and freight forwarding services primarily to the Alaska market through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Span Intermediate, LLC Span Alaska ). Span Alaska s business aggregates LCL freight at its cross-dock facility in Auburn, Washington for consolidation and shipment to its service center in Anchorage and a network of other facilities in Alaska. Span Alaska also provides trucking services to its Auburn cross-dock facility and from its Alaska based cross-dock facilities to final customer destinations in Alaska. Warehousing and Distribution Services: Matson Logistics operates two warehouses in Georgia and two warehouses in Northern California providing warehousing, trans-loading, value-added packaging and distribution services. Supply Chain Management and Other Services: Matson Logistics provides customers with a variety of logistics services including purchase order management, booking services, customs brokerage, LCL and full container load NVOCC freight forwarding services. Matson Logistics has supply chain operations in North America, China and other locations. Operating Costs: Matson Logistics operating costs primarily consist of the costs of purchased transportation, leases of warehouses, cross-dock and other facility operating costs, salaries and benefits, and other operating overhead. Competition: Matson Logistics competes with hundreds of local, regional, national and international companies that provide transportation and third-party logistics services. The industry is highly fragmented and, therefore, competition varies by geography and areas of service. Matson Logistics transportation brokerage services compete most directly with C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Hub Group, RXO and other freight brokers and intermodal marketing companies, and asset-invested market leaders such as J.B. Hunt. Competition is differentiated by the depth, scale and scope of customer relationships; vendor relationships and rates; network capacity; real-time visibility into the movement of customers goods; and other technology solutions. Additionally, while Matson Logistics primarily provides surface transportation brokerage, it also competes to a lesser degree with other forms of transportation for the movement of cargo. Matson Logistics freight forwarding services compete most directly with a variety of freight forwarding companies that operate within Alaska including Carlile, Lynden, American Fast Freight and Alaska Traffic Company. Customer Concentration: Matson Logistics serves customers in numerous industries and geographical locations. The Company s 10 largest logistics customers account for approximately 18 percent of the Company s Logistics revenue. For additional information on Logistics revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below.

 Seasonality: In general, Matson Logistics services are not significantly impacted by seasonality factors, with the exception of its freight forwarding service to Alaska which may be affected by winter weather and the seasonal nature of the tourism industry. However, the weakening economic conditions in the U.S., relatively high inflation and the impact of higher interest rates on household discretionary income may affect the demand for consumer goods, which could impact Matson s Logistics businesses in 2023. C. EMPLOYEES AND LABOR RELATIONS Human Capital Strategy: In support of Matson s vision to be a great place to work for all employees, the Company focuses on a variety of human capital programs that have been developed to attract, retain and motivate its employee workforce. As a company that operates in various global locations, the Company s human capital programs are designed to reflect the unique market practices in each geographic location. The Company s success depends in part on employing a diverse, talented and engaged workforce that reflects its local communities, supports an environment of high standards and performance, and thrives in the Company s collaborative and respectful culture. During 2022, Matson had 4,288 employees worldwide, of which 159 employees were based in international locations and 2,994 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions. These numbers include seagoing personnel who rotate through billets (as described below) and temporary employees, but do not include employees of SSAT or other non-employee affiliates such as agents and contractors. The composition of Matson s workforce by geography is as follows: Matson s fleet of active vessels requires 331 billets to operate. Each billet corresponds to a position on a vessel that typically is filled by two or more employees because seagoing personnel rotate between active sea-duty and time ashore. These amounts exclude billets related to Matson s foreign-flagged chartered vessels where the vessel owner is responsible for its seagoing personnel. Matson s vessel management services also employed personnel in 32 billets to manage three U.S. government vessels. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE I): For many years, Matson has been committed to improving diversity, providing equal pay for equal work and creating an inclusive culture. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, traditionally the shipping industry s workforce has been predominately represented by white males. While Matson s workforce is representative of many of the communities where it operates, the Company has taken steps to do more to change the status quo within the Company and industry. In 2022, the Company continued to advance many of its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. This includes continuing its efforts to analyze pay among various employee groups to confirm pay equity across the Company.

Table of Contents 
 As part of its overall DE I strategy, Matson continues to focus on developing and promoting diverse individuals into leadership positions. The Company utilizes both internal and external learning and development programs to encourage and promote career opportunities within our diverse employee groups. In 2022, approximately two-thirds of Matson promotions in management roles were women and/or minority individuals. Matson is also focused on supporting a more diverse talent pool over the long-term by encouraging women and minorities to pursue careers in the maritime and logistics sectors. To this end, in 2022 the Company established and awarded sixteen scholarships to diverse, high-achieving students at higher education institutions and maritime academies. Matson has also worked to enhance employees understanding and perspective on working with diverse groups of individuals. In 2022, the Company provided two DE I trainings to deepen employees understanding and appreciation for ways to improve interactions with others and promote more inclusive relationships. One training focused on ways people communicate that reinforce stereotypes and perpetuate discrimination, often unintentionally, called microaggressions. The other DE I training provided a broad overview of general diversity, equity and inclusion principles the dos and don ts of respectful social interaction. These trainings were completed by more than 1,100 employees during the past year. The composition of Matson s domestic shoreside workforce by gender and race in 2022 is as follows (data for seagoing personnel is not available to the Company): The composition of management positions within Matson s domestic shoreside workforce by gender and race in 2022 is as follows (data for seagoing personnel is not available to the Company): Minority in these graphs refers to any employee who self-identifies as such under the categories established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Total Rewards Programs: Matson provides a highly competitive and balanced total rewards program designed to attract, retain and motivate its employees . While factors such as job, location and business unit ultimately determine which plans an employee may be eligible for participation, the Company s total rewards offering includes market competitive base salaries, cash and equity incentives, recognition awards, health and welfare benefits, and employee and employer funded retirement plans. The Company believes that management level positions should have a portion of pay aligned with its short- and long-term business objectives. Accordingly, the Company s total rewards program contains several pay-for-performance components tied to individual, business unit and company performance, as well as Matson stock price performance.

 Succession and Career Planning: Matson s workforce is characterized by uniquely skilled, long-tenured employees. To create career pathways for future leaders while planning for the loss of retiring employees, the Company takes a proactive approach to succession and career planning. The Company focuses on providing the next generation of promising talent with the tools they need to build their own careers at Matson. In 2022, 44 percent of open positions were filled through internal promotions. The Company also provided approximately 3,500 hours of employee training and professional development opportunities, and tuition reimbursement programs, while giving annual performance reviews to its non-union workforce. For more information on Matson s human capital programs, see our Sustainability Report which is available at www.matson.com/sustainability . Bargaining Agreements: Matson s shoreside and seagoing employees are represented by a variety of unions. As shown in the chart below, union employees comprise 70 percent of Matson s global workforce. Matson has collective bargaining agreements with these unions that expire at various dates in the future, including as early as 2023. Matson and SSAT are also members of the Pacific Maritime Association PMA ), which on behalf of its members negotiates collective bargaining agreements with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union ILWU on the U.S. West Coast. The PMA/ILWU collective bargaining agreements cover substantially all U.S. West Coast longshore labor. The ILWU collective bargaining agreement with the PMA expired on July 1, 2022. While Matson believes that it will be able to renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements as they expire without any significant impact on its operations, including the PMA/ILWU collective bargaining agreement, no assurance can be given that such agreements will be reached on a timely basis or at all without slow-downs, strikes, lockouts or other disruptions that may adversely impact Matson s operations. Multi-employer Pension and Post-retirement Plans: Matson contributes to several multi-employer pension and post-retirement plans. Matson has no present intention of withdrawing from and does not anticipate the termination of any of the multi-employer pension plans to which it contributes (see Notes 11 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below for a discussion of withdrawal liabilities under certain multi-employer pension plans). D.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The following material factors, events and uncertainties may make an investment in the Company speculative or risky and should be reviewed carefully. The Company s business faces the material risks set forth below; however, these risk factors do not identify all risks the Company faces, and additional risks or uncertainties that are currently unknown or are not currently believed to be material may occur or become material. The occurrence of these or the events and uncertainties described below may, in ways the Company may not be able to accurately predict, recognize or control, adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, demand, revenue, growth, prospects, reputation or stock price. All forward-looking statements made by the Company or on the Company s behalf are qualified by the risks described below. Risks Related to the Jones Act Repeal, substantial amendment, or waiver of the Jones Act or its application would have an adverse effect on the Company s business. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (commonly referred to as the Jones Act) regulates all interstate and intrastate marine commerce within the U.S. If the Jones Act were repealed, substantially amended or waived and, as a consequence, competitors were to enter the Hawaii or Alaska markets with lower operating costs by utilizing their ability to acquire and operate foreign-flagged and foreign-built vessels and/or being exempt from other U.S. regulations, the Company s business would be adversely affected. In addition, the Company s position as a U.S. citizen operator of Jones Act vessels would be negatively impacted if periodic efforts and attempts by foreign interests to circumvent certain aspects of the Jones Act were successful. If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise altered, the shipping of cargo between covered U.S. ports could be opened to foreign-flagged or foreign-built vessels and could have other adverse impacts to our business. The Company s business would be adversely affected if the Company were determined not to be a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act. Certain provisions of the Company s articles of incorporation protect the Company s ability to maintain its status as a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act. If non-U.S. citizens were able to defeat such articles of incorporation restrictions and own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the Company s common stock, the Company would no longer be considered a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act. Such an event could result in the Company s ineligibility to engage in coastwise trade and the imposition of substantial penalties against it, including seizure or forfeiture of its vessels. Risks Related to the Company s Operations Changes in macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical developments, or governmental policies, including from the COVID-19 pandemic, have affected and could in the future affect the Company. The transportation industry in which the Company operates has been impacted by fluctuations, volatility, downturns, inflation, recessions and other economic shifts or market instabilities, as well as the development of and changes in governmental policies and relations and geopolitical developments, across the jurisdictions in which it operates. For example, there have been increases in geopolitical and trade tensions among a number of the world s major economies. These tensions have resulted in the implementation of tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers and sanctions, including the use of export control restrictions and sanctions against certain countries and individual companies, which have, and may continue to have, an adverse economic impact in the markets in which the Company operates. These adverse economic conditions may also impact customers business levels and needs. Within the U.S., a weakening of economic drivers in Hawaii, Alaska and Guam, which include tourism, military spending, construction, personal income growth and employment, the weakening of consumer confidence, market demand, and the economy in the U.S. Mainland, inflation, rising interest rates, recessionary fears and the effect of a change in the strength of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies may reduce the demand for goods, adversely affecting inland and ocean transportation volumes or rates. In addition, overcapacity in the global or transpacific ocean transportation markets, a change in the cost of goods or currency exchange rates, pressure from U.S. or foreign governments, imposition of tariffs 
 14 

Table of Contents 
 and uncertainties regarding tariff rates or a change in international trade policies could adversely affect freight volumes and rates in the Company s CLX and CLX+ services. Fluctuations in the price of oil could further impact the Alaskan economy, which in turn could impact the Company s business. In addition, the global macroeconomic effects of the pandemic and related impacts on the Company s customers business operations, including financial difficulties or bankruptcies, may persist for an indefinite period, even as the pandemic subsides. As the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, supply and demand trends normalize, and supply chain congestion eases, the high volumes and rates the Company previously experienced in its China service have declined, but the Company cannot predict the size and duration of such decline. These declines have reduced and are expected to continue to reduce revenues, but certain fixed costs remain. For example, the Company cannot terminate leases early for chartered vessels in the CLX+ service absent a breach by vessel owners. The Company s operations may be further impacted if its employees, including mariners aboard our vessels, are otherwise restricted from or unable to perform their duties, the Company s or SSAT s terminals are temporarily closed, or there are outbreaks aboard the Company s vessels that cause the Company to miss port calls, due to a COVID-19 outbreak. Some vessel dry-dockings could also be delayed or become more expensive if shipyards are unable to accommodate demand or obtain parts in a timely manner or if necessary personnel are not allowed to travel to the shipyards. As the COVID-19 pandemic reaches endemic stages, the future impact on the Company s business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows remains difficult to predict at this time. Additional or unforeseen effects from COVID-19, including resurgences or mutations of the virus and the actions taken in response to the virus, may give rise to additional risks or instigate or amplify the other risks described throughout these Risk Factors. The shipping industry is competitive, and the Company has been impacted by new or increased competition. The Company may face new competition by established or start-up shipping operators that enter the Company s markets. The shipping industry is competitive with limited barriers to entry, especially in international tradelanes. Ocean carriers can shift vessels in and out of tradelanes or charter vessels to manage capacity and meet customer demands. The entry of a new competitor or the addition of new vessels or capacity by existing competition on any of the Company s routes could result in a significant increase in available shipping capacity that could have an adverse effect on the Company s volumes and rates. The loss of or damage to key customer or agent relationships may adversely affect the Company s business. The Company s businesses are dependent on their relationships with customers and agents, and derive a significant portion of their revenues from the Company s largest customers. The Company s business relies on its relationships with the U.S. military, freight forwarders and non-vessel owning common carriers, large retailers and consumer goods manufacturers, as well as other larger customers. For more information regarding the Company s significant customers, see the discussion in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report. The Company could also be adversely affected by any changes in the services, or changes to the costs of services, provided by third- party vendors such as railroads, truckers, terminals, agents and shipping companies, including charter vessel owners. Service structures and relationships with these parties are important in the Company s intermodal business, as well as in the China, Guam, Micronesia, Japan, Alaska export and South Pacific services. The loss of or damage to any of these key relationships may adversely affect the Company s business and revenue. The Company is dependent upon key vendors and third parties for equipment, capacity, facilities, infrastructure and services essential to operate its business, and if the Company fails to secure sufficient third-party services, its business could be adversely affected. The Company s businesses are dependent upon key vendors who provide terminal, rail, truck, and ocean transportation services. If the Company cannot secure sufficient transportation equipment, capacity or services from these third parties at reasonable prices or rates to meet its or its customers needs and schedules, customers may seek to have their

 transportation and logistics needs met by others on a temporary or permanent basis. If this were to occur, the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. An increase in fuel prices, changes in the Company s ability to collect fuel-related surcharges, and/or the cost or limited availability of required fuels on the U.S. West Coast may adversely affect the Company s profits. Fuel is a significant operating expense for the Company s Ocean Transportation business. The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond the Company s control, including impacts from global macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical events. Increases in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company s results of operations. Increases in fuel costs also can lead to increases in other expenses, such as energy costs and costs to purchase outside transportation services. In the Company s Ocean Transportation and Logistics services segments, the Company utilizes fuel-related surcharges, although increases in the fuel-related surcharge may adversely affect the Company s competitive position and may not correspond exactly with the timing of increases in fuel expense. Changes in the Company s ability to collect fuel-related surcharges, including recovery of all or most fuel-related expenses, also may adversely affect its results of operations. Evolving stakeholder expectations related to environmental, social and governance ESG matters exposes the Company to heightened scrutiny, additional costs, operational challenges and a number of risks. Investors, advisory firms, employees, customers, suppliers, governments and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on, and establishing expectations for, ESG matters and related corporate practices, disclosures and initiatives. These evolving expectations may impact the Company s reputation, business and attractiveness as an investment, employer or business partner to the extent the Company including its initiatives, goals and reporting meets or is perceived to meet those expectations, including as a result of any third-party rating or assessment. The adoption and expansion of ESG-related legislation and regulation have also resulted and may again result in increased capital expenditures and compliance, operational and other costs to the Company. The Company s public disclosures on its climate, sustainability, human capital and other ESG initiatives include its goals or expectations with respect to those matters, including GHG emission reduction targets. These disclosures are aspirational and based on standards and frameworks for presenting and measuring progress that are not harmonized and are still developing, assumptions that may change, and disclosure controls and procedures that continue to evolve. The Company s initiatives and goals may not be favored by certain stakeholders and could impact the attraction and retention of investors, customers and employees, as well as the Company s willingness to do business with other companies or customers or their willingness to do business with us. Efforts to achieve the Company s initiatives and goals face numerous risks and may be unsuccessful, result in additional costs or experience delays, and as a result may have an adverse impact on the Company, including its brand, reputation and stock price. The Company may not be timely or successful in completing its fleet upgrade initiatives, which may result in significant costs and adversely impact the Company s ability to meet its climate goals. The Company s four new Aloha and Kanaloa class vessels include dual fuel capable engines that can run on low sulfur fuel oil or LNG. The Company has announced plans to install tanks, piping and cryogenic equipment on Daniel K. Inouye and Kaimana Hila , and re-engine Manukai to operate on LNG. In addition, the Company has announced plans to construct three new LNG-ready Aloha Class vessels. The Company anticipates making significant capital expenditures in connection with these fleet initiatives. These initiatives may be hindered by substantial delays and long lead times for necessary equipment, including as a result of ongoing supply chain congestion, other residual impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, increased demand across the industry for LNG installations and conversions, and new ship-building. Additional operating costs may be incurred to the extent additional ships are needed to maintain schedule integrity while such updates and installations are performed. Once completed, operation of these vessels may be slowed to the extent they present new maintenance requirements or unforeseen complications. Use of LNG fuel may not result in anticipated GHG emission reductions, and the Company s investments in LNG-ready vessels, whether on their own or in addition to other Company initiatives, may be insufficient to meet the Company s previously announced GHG emission reduction goals on a timely basis or at all. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to secure LNG via bunker barges or other methods on the U.S. West Coast or in China in sufficient amounts to fuel its vessels or at a reasonable cost, as increased demand for LNG could decrease available supply of LNG and 
 16 

Table of Contents 
 increase prices. Governments have in the past and may again in the future impose tariffs on LNG that also may increase supply costs. As a result of these risks, the Company may not fully realize the benefits of these investments. The Company s vessel construction agreements with Philly Shipyard subject the Company to risks. On November 1, 2022, MatNav and Philly Shipyard entered into vessel construction agreements pursuant to which Philly Shipyard will construct three new 3,600-TEU Aloha Class dual-fuel capable containerships, with expected delivery dates during the fourth quarter of 2026 and subsequent deliveries currently expected in the second and fourth quarters of 2027. Failure of any party to the vessel construction agreements to fulfill its obligations under the agreements could have an adverse effect on the Company s financial position and results of operations. Such a failure could happen for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to (i) delivery delays, (ii) delivery of vessels that fail to meet any of the required operating specifications (for example, capacity, fuel efficiency or speed), (iii) events in South Korea that prevent one or more significant subcontractors to Philly Shipyard from performing, (iv) loss of key personnel at either Philly Shipyard or any of its subcontractors, (v) work stoppages or other labor disruptions that may occur as a result of the failure of Philly Shipyard to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with its unions, or (vi) the insolvency of, or the refusal or inability to perform for any reason, by Philly Shipyard or any of its subcontractors. Significant delays in the delivery of the new vessels could limit our ability to replace aging vessels in the Alaska service without substantial modifications, which could also have an adverse impact on our business plans, financial condition and results of operations. The Company s operations are susceptible to weather, natural disasters, maritime accidents, spill events and other physical and operating risks, including those arising from climate change. As a maritime transportation company, the Company s operations are vulnerable to disruption as a result of weather, natural disasters and other climate-driven events, such as rising temperatures, sea levels and storm severity, bad weather at sea, hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods and earthquakes, as well as a maritime accident, oil or other spill, or other environmental mishap. Climate change has increased and may continue to increase the frequency, severity and uncertainty of such events. Such events interfere with the Company s ability to provide on-time scheduled service, resulting in increased expenses and potential loss of business associated with such events. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters can result in interference with the Company s terminal operations and may cause serious damage to its vessels and cranes. These impacts could be particularly acute in ports such as Dutch Harbor and Kodiak, Alaska where the Company is dependent on a single crane. The Company s vessels and their cargoes are also subject to operating risks such as mechanical failure, collisions and human error. The occurrence of any of these events may result in damage to or loss of terminals, port facilities and infrastructure, vessels, containers, cargo and other equipment, increased maintenance expense, loss of life or physical injury to its employees or people, pollution, or the slow down or suspension of operations. These events can expose the Company to reputational harm and liability for resulting damages and possible penalties that, pursuant to typical maritime industry policies, it must pay and then seek reimbursement from its insurer. Affected vessels may also be removed from service and thus would be unavailable for income-generating activity. Furthermore, the Port of Alaska requires upgrades to its port facilities and infrastructure to improve operational safety and efficiency, accommodate modern shipping operations and improve resiliency, as well as to mitigate the risk of failure due to corrosion or loss of load-bearing capacity. As a result, there is an increased risk that an earthquake or other natural disaster could damage or render inoperable, in whole or in part, port facilities and infrastructure at the Port of Alaska. This, in turn, could adversely affect transportation volumes or rates in Alaska and adversely impact the Company s Ocean Transportation business and Span Alaska s freight forwarding business, particularly given the Alaskan economy s dependence on this port for ocean cargo. The Company s casualty and liability insurance policies are generally subject to large retentions and deductibles and may not cover all losses the Company may incur. Some types of losses, such as losses resulting from a port blockage, generally are not insured. In some cases, the Company retains the entire risk of loss because it is not economically prudent to purchase insurance coverage or because of the perceived remoteness of the risk. Other risks are uninsured because insurance coverage may not be commercially available. Finally, the Company retains all risk of loss that exceeds the limits of its insurance.

 The Company may be impacted by transitional and other risks arising from climate change. The Company may be impacted by transitional and other risks arising from climate change and the global shift toward a low carbon future. Organizational, industrial and governmental shifts in operations as well as legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or eliminate emissions and/or increase efficiency may require the Company to increase expenditures, make changes to existing infrastructure, vessels and equipment and shift its business model. For example, the maritime industry is moving toward deployment of clean energy technologies and use of electricity powered by renewable energy sources to power terminal operations as a way to reduce shoreside GHG emissions. As the Company and SSAT increase their reliance on the power grid at terminals, including for cold-ironing and ground service fleets, the Company may experience increased risks related to power outages, brown outs or black outs. The likelihood of these risks is compounded by uncertainties regarding the reliability of renewable energy sources as well as any increased frequency of extreme weather events that may disrupt the generation or transmission of electricity. In addition, compliance with new climate change requirements or regulations such as the IMO s requirements related to EEXI and CII may create schedule disruptions and could require Matson s fleet to slow down if efficiency improvements or transitions to alternative fuels together are not enough to reduce GHG emissions sufficiently, thus impacting Matson s expedited business model and competitive advantage. New environmental requirements for vessel performance and operation could also require the Company to accelerate the building of new vessels, increase the construction costs for new vessels and equipment to accommodate even newer technology as it emerges while today s technology becomes obsolete, initiate unexpected retrofit projects for existing vessels, retire older vessels earlier than expected, or render reserve vessels unusable. If these outcomes were to occur, the Company s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. The Company faces risks related to actual or threatened health epidemics, pandemics or other major health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which could significantly disrupt the Company s business. The Company s business could be impacted adversely by the effects of public health epidemics, pandemics or other major heath crises (which the Company refers to collectively as public health crises). Actual or threatened public health crises may have a number of adverse impacts, including volatility in the global economy, impacts to the Company s customers business operations, reduced tourism in the markets the Company serves, potential restrictions on employee travel, or significant disruptions in ocean-borne transportation of goods, logistics demand and supply chain activity, caused by a variety of factors such as quarantines, factory and office closures, port closures, or other government-imposed restrictions, any of which could adversely impact the Company s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. The Company s significant operating agreements and leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced on acceptable terms. The significant operating agreements and leases entered into by the Company in its businesses, including those related to terminals, chartered vessels and warehouses as well as those with SSAT, expire at various points in time and may not be replaced with comparable assets with the specifications necessary for the Company s or SSAT s businesses or could be replaced on less favorable terms, thereby adversely affecting the Company s future financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company may face unexpected dry-docking or repair costs for its vessels. The Company routinely engage shipyards to dry-dock its vessels for regulatory compliance and to provide repair and maintenance. Vessels may also have to be dry-docked or repaired at sea in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage. Unexpected dry-dockings or repairs could require the Company to activate a reserve vessel, purchase additional fuel and operate a less-efficient, smaller vessel for a period of time. The Company also operates a number of older active and reserve vessels that may require more frequent and extensive maintenance. The cost of repairs is difficult to predict with certainty and can be substantial. In addition, the time when a vessel is out of service for maintenance is determined by a number of factors, including regulatory deadlines, market conditions, shipyard availability and customer requirements, and accordingly, the length of time that a vessel may be out of service may be longer than anticipated, which could adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 The Company is involved in a joint venture and is subject to risks associated with joint venture relationships. The Company is involved in a terminal joint venture with SSAT (and through SSAT, other joint ventures at various U.S. West Coast terminals), and may initiate future joint venture projects. A joint venture involves certain risks for the Company such as: The Company s lack of voting control over the joint venture, including the risk that the joint venture takes actions resulting in reputational harm to the Company; Misalignment or inconsistency of interests between the Company and the joint venture partner; Reliance on the joint venture partner to fund its share of capital or fulfill its other commitments, including the risk that the joint venture partner could become bankrupt; and Operating difficulties and financial losses at the joint venture, which may lead to the Company writing down assets or incurring impairment charges. In addition, the Company relies on SSAT for its stevedoring services at the ports of Long Beach and Oakland, California and Tacoma, Washington on the U.S. West Coast. The Company could be adversely affected by any changes in the services provided or to the costs of such services provided by SSAT. Furthermore, the Company s results of operations have been and may continue to be impacted by lower contributions from SSAT, including as a result of declines in detention and demurrage revenue and lift volumes due to reduced carrier volumes into U.S. West Coast ports. The Company is subject to risks associated with conducting business in foreign shipping markets. Matson s China, Alaska export, Micronesia, Japan and South Pacific services are subject to risks associated with conducting business in a foreign shipping market, which include: Challenges associated with operating in foreign countries and developing relationships with foreign companies, business associates and governments, including as a result of cultural differences; Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including dynamic employment and immigration laws; The Company s ability to comply with U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory restrictions, including anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; Not having continued access to existing port facilities or feeder vessels; The Company s ability to manage changes in the cost of goods or currency exchange rate fluctuations; Geopolitical and economic instability; Economic downturns or slower growth in the local markets or geographic areas in which we conduct business; and Dynamics involving U.S. trade relations with other countries, including the imposition of or uncertainty associated with the level of tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers or sanctions, including the use of export control restrictions and sanctions against certain countries and individual companies, or other governmental actions. The Company s terminals in Hawaii and Alaska require modernization. The Company has completed the first phase of renovating and modernizing its Sand Island terminal in Honolulu Harbor. Significant additional upgrades and projects remain. The Company is also continuing discussions with state and local authorities regarding a port modernization program for the Port of Alaska. Significant upgrades to the terminal and port facilities are needed to improve operational safety and efficiency, accommodate modern shipping operations, and improve resiliency. For example, the aging docks of the port are increasingly exposed to the risk of failure due to corrosion and the loss of load-bearing capacity particularly in the event of extreme seismic events or other natural disasters. Regulatory, construction or other delays or cost overruns related to the expansion and modernization of the terminals could have an adverse impact on the Company s business plans, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the terminal modernization programs may not result in improved operational productivity or generate expected returns.

 Heightened security measures, war, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism and other acts of violence may adversely impact the Company s operations and profitability. War, including the war in Ukraine, terrorist attacks and other acts of violence may cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease, or may affect the ability or willingness of tourists to travel to Hawaii, Guam or Alaska, thereby adversely affecting those economies and the Company. Wars or terrorism could impact global supply chains due to changes in vessel routing, product sourcing decisions, or governmental sanctions or restrictions. Additionally, acts of war and future terrorist attacks could increase volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets. Acts of war or terrorism may also be directed at the Company s shipping operations or may cause the U.S. government to take control of Matson s vessels for military operation. Heightened security measures, including customs inspections and related procedures in countries of origin and destination, potentially slow the movement and increase the cost of freight through U.S. or foreign ports, across borders or on U.S. or foreign railroads or highways. Acquisitions may have an adverse effect on the Company s business. The Company s growth strategy includes expansion through acquisitions, including, for example, the Company s acquisitions of Horizon Lines, Inc. Horizon in 2015 and Span Alaska in 2016. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in identifying, negotiating, or consummating any future acquisitions. Even if suitable candidates are identified, such transactions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired assets or companies, and may result in the diversion of the Company s capital and its management attention from other business issues and opportunities. The Company may not be able to integrate companies that it acquires successfully, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures. The Company may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company. The Company may pay a premium for an acquisition, resulting in goodwill that may later be determined to be impaired. Risks Related to Employees Work stoppages or other labor disruptions caused by the Company s unionized workers and other workers or their unions in related industries could adversely affect the Company s operations. A significant portion of Matson s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Furthermore, the Company relies on the services of third parties, including SSAT, which employ persons covered by collective bargaining agreements. For additional information on collective bargaining agreements with unions, see Item 1.C. Employees and Labor Relations of Part I of this Annual Report. The Company has been adversely affected by actions taken by employees of the Company or other companies in related industries against efforts by management of the Company or other companies to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefit increases or modify work practices. In the past, strikes, slow-downs and disruptions have occurred as a result of the failure of Matson or other companies in its industry to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with such unions successfully. Matson and SSAT are members of the PMA, which on behalf of its members negotiates collective bargaining agreements with the ILWU on the U.S. West Coast. The PMA/ILWU collective bargaining agreements that cover substantially all U.S. West Coast longshore labor expired on July 1, 2022. These collective bargaining agreements are being negotiated, but if such agreements are not renewed, Matson and SSAT could be subject to future slow-downs, strikes, lock-outs or other disruptions that may adversely impact Matson s or SSAT s operations. In addition, any slow-downs, strikes, lock-outs or other disruptions, including limits on the availability of labor through trade union hiring halls, have had and in the future, particularly in years when collective bargaining agreements are being negotiated, could have an adverse impact on Matson s or SSAT s operations.

 Loss of the Company s key personnel or failure to adequately manage human capital could adversely affect its business. The Company s future success will depend, in significant part, upon the continued services of its key personnel and skilled employees, including its senior management, as well as key personnel at its joint venture partners. The permanent or temporary loss of the services of key personnel could adversely affect the Company s future operating results because of such employees experience with and knowledge of the Company s business and customer relationships. If key personnel and skilled employees depart or are unable or unwilling to work, the Company s ability to execute its business model could be impaired to the extent it cannot replace such personnel or sufficiently train new personnel in a timely manner. In addition, the Company may incur significant costs to replace these employees. Whether the Company can meet its labor needs is subject to a variety of pressures, including market compensation and benefit levels, which may be impacted by pressure within the industry to increase wages, including due to the threat of a labor strike; the availability of labor, which may be impacted by national and global labor trends including higher-than-normal levels of individuals leaving the workforce and industry trends including aging workforces that may reduce the available pool of skilled workers; a mismatch of skills or experience to support the evolving needs of the Company s business; and employee expectations or desire for changes in the work environment. In addition, the Company s workforce is aging, and within the next few years an increasing number of employees will be eligible to retire, which may result in a period of higher turnover rates than we have historically experienced and could amplify these challenges. The Company does not maintain key person insurance on any of its key personnel. The Company s investments in and efforts to manage its human capital and maintain a desirable workplace culture, including to create a safe and healthy work environment, improve diversity and create a respectful, responsive and inclusive culture, and foster a rewarding workplace for employee development and advancement, may not be successful in identifying, attracting, developing, motivating, retaining, competing for or replacing qualified personnel. These efforts and the Company s reputation may also be impacted by any failure or perceived failure to meet or timely progress on publicly disclosed human capital-related goals and initiatives, including with respect to diversity, equity and inclusion, or to compare favorably with the progress or goals of its industry or peers. Risks Related to Information Technology If the Company is not able to use its information technology and communications systems effectively, the Company s ability to conduct business might be negatively impacted. The Company is highly dependent on the proper functioning of its information technology systems to enable operations and compete effectively. The Company regularly updates its information technology systems or implements new systems, which could cause substantial business interruption. There is no assurance that the systems upgrades or new systems will meet the Company s current or future business needs, or that they will operate as designed. The Company s information technology systems also rely on third-party service providers for access to the Internet, satellite-based communications systems, the electric grid, database storage facilities and telecommunications providers. The Company has no control over the operations of these third-party service providers. In the past, disruptions in the Company s third-party service providers have impacted the Company s operations, including the Company s ability to book and manage freight, stow vessels, and process customs declarations. In the past, some of the Company s employees worked from home or remotely, increasing the Company s dependence on its information technology systems and third-party providers during those times. If the Company s information technology and communications systems experience reliability issues, integration or compatibility concerns or if the Company s third-party providers are unable to perform effectively or experience disruptions or failures, there could be an adverse impact on the availability and functioning of the Company s information technology and communications systems, which could lead to business disruption or inefficiencies, reputational harm or loss of customers.

 The Company s information technology systems have in the past and may in the future be exposed to cybersecurity risks and other disruptions that could impair the Company s ability to operate and adversely affect its business. The shipping industry is a more frequent target of cyber attacks than some other industries because of the essential nature of these services. The Company relies extensively on its information technology systems and third-party service providers in many aspects of its business, including cloud services for accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and employee communication systems. The Company also collects, stores and transmits sensitive data, including its proprietary business information and that of its customers, and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees. Despite the Company s continuous efforts to make investments in the Company s information technology systems and system-wide data security program, the implementation of security measures to protect the Company s data and infrastructure against breaches and other cyber threats, and the Company s use of internal processes and controls designed to protect the security and availability of the Company s systems, the Company has in the past experienced and may in the future experience cybersecurity incidents, such as computer viruses, hacking, malware, denial of service attacks, cyber terrorism, ransomware, circumvention of security systems, malfeasance, breaches due to employee error, natural disasters, telecommunications failure, or other catastrophic events at the Company s facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations. Any failure, breach or unauthorized access to the Company s systems or those of third parties on which the Company relies could result in the loss of confidential, sensitive or proprietary information, interruptions in its service or production or otherwise impact the Company s ability to conduct business operations, and could result in potential reductions in revenue and profits, damage to its reputation or liability. Risks Related to Financial Matters A deterioration of the Company s credit profile, disruptions of the credit markets or higher interest rates could restrict its ability to access the debt capital markets or increase the cost of debt. Deterioration in the Company s credit profile may have an adverse effect on the Company s ability to access the private or public debt markets and also may increase its borrowing costs. If the Company s credit profile deteriorates significantly, its access to the debt capital markets or its ability to renew its committed lines of credit may become restricted, or the Company may not be able to refinance debt at the same levels or on the same terms. Because the Company relies on its ability to draw on its revolving credit facility to support its operations when required, any volatility in the credit and financial markets that prevents the Company from accessing funds (for example, a lender that does not fulfill its lending obligation) could have an adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, the Company s credit agreements generally include an increase in borrowing rates if the Company s credit profile deteriorates. Furthermore, the Company incurs interest under its revolving credit facility based on floating rates. Floating rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase, as has been the case in connection with the U.S. Federal Reserve s interest rate increases in 2022, which could adversely affect the Company s cash flow and results of operations. Disruptions to the credit markets as a result of macroeconomic, geopolitical, or financial market developments could increase the Company s cost of capital and limit the Company s access to capital. Failure to comply with certain restrictive financial covenants contained in the Company s credit facilities could preclude the payment of dividends, impose restrictions on the Company s business segments, capital resources or other activities or otherwise adversely affect the Company. The Company s credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants, the most restrictive of which include a maximum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), a minimum ratio of EBITDA to interest expense, certain prohibitions on additional priority debt and the maintenance of minimum shareholders equity. If the Company does not maintain these and other required covenants, and a breach of such covenants is not cured timely or waived by the lenders, resulting in a default, the Company s access to credit may be limited or terminated, dividends may be suspended, and the lenders could declare any outstanding amounts due and payable. The Company s continued ability to borrow under its credit facilities is subject to compliance with these financial and other non-financial covenants.

 The Company s effective income tax rate may vary. Various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable material or immaterial effects on the Company s effective income tax rate and, therefore, impact the Company s net income and earnings per share. These factors include, but are not limited to changes in tax rates; changes in tax laws, regulations, and rulings; changes in interpretations of existing tax laws, regulations and rulings; changes in the evaluation of the Company s ability to realize deferred tax assets, and changes in uncertain tax positions; changes in accounting principles; changes in current pre-tax income as well as changes in forecasted pre-tax income; changes in the level of Capital Construction Fund CCF deductions, non-deductible expenses, and expenses eligible for tax credits; changes in the mix of earnings among countries with varying tax rates; changes to the allowable amounts of foreign derived intangible income deductions; and acquisitions and changes in the Company s corporate structure. These factors may result in periodic revisions to the Company s effective income tax rate, which could affect the Company s cash flow and results of operations. Changes in the value of pension assets, or a change in pension law or key assumptions, may adversely affect the Company s financial performance. The amount of the Company s employee pension and post-retirement benefit costs and obligations is calculated on assumptions used in the relevant actuarial calculations. Adverse changes in any of these assumptions due to economic or other factors, changes in discount rates, higher health care costs, or lower actual or expected returns on plan assets, may adversely affect the Company s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition. In addition, a change in federal law, including changes to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, may adversely affect the Company s single-employer and multi-employer pension plans and plan funding. These factors, as well as a decline in the fair value of pension plan assets, may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits and may increase future pension expense and required funding contributions. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in limiting future cost and expense increases, and continued upward pressure in costs and expenses could further reduce the profitability of the Company s businesses. The Company may have exposure under its multi-employer pension and post-retirement plans in which it participates that extends beyond its funding obligation with respect to the Company s employees. The Company contributes to various multi-employer pension plans. In the event of a partial or complete withdrawal by the Company from any plan that is underfunded, the Company would be liable for a proportionate share of such plan s unfunded vested benefits (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report). Based on the limited information available from plan administrators, which the Company cannot independently validate, the Company believes that its portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination may be material to its financial position and results of operations. If any other contributing employer withdraws from any plan that is underfunded, and such employer (or any member of its controlled group) cannot satisfy its obligations under the plan at the time of withdrawal, then the Company, along with the other remaining contributing employers, would be liable for its proportionate share of such plan s unfunded vested benefits. In addition, if any of the multi-employer plans to which the Company contributes fails to satisfy the minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service will impose certain penalties and taxes on the Company and other contributing employers. Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Matters As an ocean transportation and logistics services company, the Company is subject to numerous safety, environmental, and other laws and regulations that impact the Company s operations, are costly to comply with and expose us to liability. The Company, including its vessels and terminals, is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those related to safety, cabotage, equipment standards and government rates. In addition, the Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air quality initiatives at port locations; air emissions; use of shore power at California ports; wastewater discharges; management of storm water; the transportation, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, oil and oil related products, hazardous substances and wastes; the investigation and remediation of contamination; health, safety and the protection of the environment and natural resources; and climate change, including any regulations, mandates or restrictions related to GHG emissions, such as a cap and trade system of allowances and credits, and energy use. Any changes in applicable laws and regulations, including their enforcement, interpretation or implementation that results in more stringent requirements

 than currently anticipated, as well as any new laws and regulations that are adopted could impose significant additional costs and limitations on the Company s ability to operate. Mitigation strategies or contingency plans to remain in compliance with applicable laws and regulations may be unsuccessful, result in additional costs or experience delays. Such costs may not be recoverable through increased payments from customers. For a discussion of specific laws and regulations, see Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report. Federal, state and local laws and regulations require us to obtain certificates of financial responsibility and to adopt procedures for oil and hazardous substance spill prevention, response and clean up, among other requirements impacting the Company s business. In complying with applicable laws and regulations, the Company has incurred expenses and may incur material future costs and expenses related to vessel and equipment modifications, new equipment, higher-priced fuel, changes in operating practices and procedures, tracking emissions, changing routes, adopting or modifying energy sources and undergoing additional oversight inspections, all of which could adversely affect the Company s business and financial condition. For example, Matson s vessels operate within emissions control areas, and the Company s U.S. flagged vessels generally must be maintained in class and are subject to periodic inspections by the American Bureau of Shipping or similar classification societies. They also must be periodically inspected by, or on behalf of, the United States Coast Guard. The Company s vessels operating certificates and licenses are renewed periodically during the required annual surveys of the vessels, but there is no assurance that the Company s programs and policies will be sufficient to have such certificates and licenses renewed. The EPA also requires vessels to obtain coverage under a general permit and to comply with inspection, monitoring, discharge, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations provide for substantial fines, as well as criminal and civil penalties, in the event of any violations of, or non-compliance with, their requirements (including any waivers, permits or recordkeeping and other reporting requirements). Any vessel-generated pollution from incidents in U.S. waters within three nautical miles, and in some cases, within the 200-mile exclusive economic zone, for example, could expose us to such fines or penalties. The Company is subject to, and may in the future be subject to, disputes, legal or other proceedings, and government inquiries or investigations that could have an adverse effect on the Company. The nature of the Company s business exposes it to the potential for disputes, legal or other proceedings, and government inquiries or investigations relating to antitrust matters, labor and employment matters, personal injury and property damage, environmental, shore power and other matters, as discussed in the other risk factors disclosed in this section or in other Company filings with the SEC. For example, Matson is a common carrier, whose tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers are governed by extensive and complex foreign, federal, state and local regulations, which may be the subject of disputes or administrative or judicial proceedings. If these disputes develop into proceedings, these proceedings, individually or collectively, could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to Matson s tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers. The Company may continue to be exposed to risks and unknown liabilities related to the Horizon acquisition. The Company acquired Horizon subject to all of the liabilities and obligations of its non-Hawaii business, including any remaining liabilities and obligations associated with its Puerto Rico operations, which Horizon ceased during the first quarter of 2015. The disposition of these liabilities, and any other obligations that are unknown to the Company, including contingent liabilities, could have an adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. Pasha acquired Horizon s former Hawaii business immediately before the Company acquired Horizon, and Pasha assumed substantially all liabilities and obligations related to Horizon s Hawaii business and agreed to perform various covenants. In some cases, however, Horizon, as the original contracting party, may remain primarily responsible for such assumed Hawaii liabilities and obligations. The Company may incur losses related to such assumed Hawaii liabilities and obligations. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.

 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Matson leases terminal facilities including berth, yard, office and storage spaces. Material terminal facilities used by the Company s Ocean Transportation segment include the following locations: 

Terminal Location Acreage Honolulu, Hawaii 105 Anchorage, Alaska 38 Dutch Harbor, Alaska 18 Kodiak, Alaska 6 Tacoma, Washington 15 Polaris Point, Guam 30 The Company s other primary terminal facilities located at the ports of Oakland and Long Beach, California, and Tacoma, Washington are leased by SSAT. Other material facilities used by both of the Company s segments include the following: 

Other Material Facilities Description of Facility Square Footage Pooler, Georgia Warehouse 710,844 Oakland, California Warehouse 406,463 Pooler, Georgia Warehouse 324,832 Oakland, California Warehouse 132,000 Anchorage, Alaska Office / Cross-dock 54,000 Auburn, Washington Office / Cross-dock 51,250 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Environmental Matters: The Company s Ocean Transportation segment has certain risks that could result in expenditures for environmental remediation. Except as described below, the Company believes that based on all information available to it, the Company is currently in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws and regulations. In accordance with SEC rules, with respect to administrative or judicial proceedings involving the environment, the Company has determined that it will disclose any such proceeding if it reasonably believes such proceeding will result in monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, at or in excess of 1 million. The Company believes that such threshold is reasonably designed to result in disclosure of environmental proceedings that are material to its business or financial condition. On November 10, 2021, the California Air Resources Board CARB issued a Notice of Violation (the NOV to Matson for alleged violations of the Airborne Toxic Control Measure for Auxiliary Diesel Engines Operated on Ocean-Going Vessels At-Berth in a California Port pursuant to California Code of Regulations, title 17, section 93118.3. CARB regulations require that a company s fleet plug into shore power for at least 80 percent of visits at California ports and reduce auxiliary engine power generation by at least 80 percent. The NOV alleges that Matson s fleet did not meet the 80 percent thresholds during visits to the Port of Long Beach in 2020. The violations were alleged to have been incurred by chartered vessels in the CLX+ service. These chartered vessels were not outfitted with alternative maritime power AMP capability which would have allowed them to plug into the shore power grid and shut down the vessel diesel generators when at dock. The Company has presented mitigating factors for consideration in settlement discussions with CARB as well as plans to achieve compliance. Although potential penalties for 2020, 2021 and 2022 violations could, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to exceed 1 million, they are not expected to be material to the Company s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Other Matters: The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to, or may be contingently liable in connection with, other legal actions arising in the normal course of their businesses, the outcomes of which, in the opinion of management after consultation with counsel, would not have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

 FOURTH QUARTER 2022 DISCUSSION AND UPDATE ON BUSINESS CONDITIONS Ocean Transportation: The Company s container volume in the Hawaii service in the fourth quarter 2022 was 13.0 percent lower year-over-year. The decrease was primarily due to (i) lower retail- and hospitality-related demand compared to elevated pandemic levels in the year ago period and (ii) one less week . During the quarter, the Company saw retail customers continue to manage inventories to weaker consumer demand levels despite continued improvement in the Hawaii economy supported by a low unemployment rate and relatively strong tourist arrivals, including a modest improvement in international tourist trends. In the near-term, Matson expects economic growth in Hawaii supported by continued strength in tourism and a low unemployment rate, but there are negative trends as a result of higher inflation, higher interest rates and the end of the pandemic-era stimulus helping personal income that creates uncertainty in the economic growth trajectory. In China, the Company s container volume in the fourth quarter 2022 decreased 47.2 percent year-over-year. The decrease was primarily due to (i) lower demand for the CLX and CLX+ services, (ii) the discontinuation of the CCX service in the third quarter 2022 and (iii) one less week. Matson continued to realize a significant rate premium over the Shanghai Containerized Freight Index SCFI in the fourth quarter 2022 but achieved average freight rates that were lower than in the year ago period. Currently in the Transpacific marketplace, business conditions remain challenging as retailers continue to right-size inventories amid weakening consumer demand, increasing interest rates and economic uncertainty. As such, the Company expects its CLX and CLX+ services in the first quarter and first half of the year to reflect freight demand levels below normalized conditions with lower year-over-year volumes and a lower rate environment. Absent an economic hard landing in the U.S., Matson expects improved trade dynamics in the second half of 2023 as the Transpacific marketplace transitions to a more normalized level of demand. Regardless of the economic environment, Matson operates the two fastest and most reliable ocean services and, as a result, the Company expects to continue to earn a significant rate premium to the SCFI . In Guam, the Company s container volume in the fourth quarter 2022 decreased 14.0 percent year-over-year primarily due to lower retail-related demand. In the near-term, the Company expects continued improvement in the Guam economy with increasing tourism and a low unemployment rate, but there are negative trends as a result of higher inflation, higher interest rates and the end of the pandemic-era stimulus helping personal income that creates uncertainty in the economic growth trajectory. In Alaska, the Company s container volume for the fourth quarter 2022 decreased 7.7 percent year-over-year due to (i) lower northbound volume primarily due to one less sailing and one less week and (ii) lower southbound volume primarily due to lower domestic seafood volume and one less week, partially offset by higher export seafood volume from Alaska-Asia Express AAX ). In the near-term, the Company expects the Alaska economy to benefit from low unemployment and increased energy-related exploration and production activity as a result of elevated oil prices, but there are negative trends as a result of higher inflation, higher interest rates and the end of the pandemic-era stimulus helping personal income that creates uncertainty in the economic growth trajectory. The contribution in the fourth quarter 2022 from the Company s SSAT joint venture investment was 1.0 million, or 20.3 million lower than the fourth quarter 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by lower other terminal revenue, lower lift volume and higher operating costs. Logistics: In the fourth quarter 2022, operating income for the Company s Logistics segment was 12.8 million, or 2.0 million lower compared to the level achieved in the fourth quarter 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a lower contribution from supply chain management consistent with lower demand in the Transpacific tradelane.

Consolidated Results: 2022 compared with 2021: 

Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2022 2021 Change Operating revenue 4,343.0 3,925.3 417.7 10.6 Operating costs and expenses (2,989.4) (2,737.8) (251.6) 9.2 Operating income 1,353.6 1,187.5 166.1 14.0 Interest income 8.2 8.2 100.0 Interest expense (18.0) (22.6) 4.6 (20.4) Other income (expense), net 8.5 6.4 2.1 32.8 Income before taxes 1,352.3 1,171.3 181.0 15.5 Income taxes (288.4) (243.9) (44.5) 18.2 Net income 1,063.9 927.4 136.5 14.7 Basic earnings per share 27.28 21.67 5.61 25.9 Diluted earnings per share 27.07 21.47 5.60 26.1 Fiscal Year: Fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 include 52 and 53 weeks, respectively. Consolidated Operating Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 417.7 million, or 10.6 percent, compared to the prior year. The increase was due to an increase in Ocean Transportation revenue of 411.8 million and an increase in Logistics revenue of 5.9 million. Operating Costs and Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 251.6 million, or 9.2 percent, compared to the prior year. The increase was due to an increase in Ocean Transportation operating costs and expenses of 268.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in Logistics operating costs and expenses of 16.7 million. Operating Income for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 166.1 million, or 14.0 percent, compared to the prior year. The increase was due to an increase in Ocean Transportation operating income of 143.5 million and an increase in Logistics operating income of 22.6 million. The reasons for changes in operating revenue, operating costs and expenses, and operating income are described below, by business segment, in Analysis of Operating Revenue and Income by Segment. Interest Income was 8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and was due to amounts on deposit in cash and cash equivalent accounts, and cash on deposit within the Capital Construction Fund that were invested in interest bearing accounts during the year ended December 31, 2022. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was nominal. Interest Expense was 18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 22.6 million in the prior year. The decrease in interest expense was due to lower outstanding debt during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year. Other Income (Expense), net was 8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 6.4 million in the prior year, and relates to the amortization of certain components of net periodic benefit costs or gains related to the Company s pension and post-retirement plans. The increase in Other income (expense) was due to favorable adjustments reflected in the Company s pension and post-retirement plan liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2021. Income Taxes for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 288.4 million, or 21.3 percent of income before income taxes, compared to 243.9 million, or 20.8 percent of income before income taxes in the prior year. The 2021 income tax rate benefited from certain discrete tax adjustments that lowered the effective tax rate in the prior year. Net Income during the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 136.5 million, or 14.7 percent, to 1,063.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year.

Ocean Transportation revenue increased 411.8 million, or 13.1 percent, during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher average freight rates in China, higher fuel-related surcharge revenue and higher volume in Alaska, partially offset by lower volume in China and Hawaii. On a year-over-year FEU basis, Hawaii container volume decreased 5.8 percent primarily due to lower retail-related demand and one less week; Alaska volume increased 8.6 percent due to (i) higher export seafood volume from AAX, (ii) higher northbound volume primarily due to higher retail-related demand and volume related to a competitor s dry-docking, partially offset by one less week and (iii) higher southbound volume primarily due to higher domestic seafood volume; China volume was 11.7 percent lower primarily due to (a) lower demand for the CLX and CLX+ services and (b) one less week, partially offset by incremental volume on the CCX service; Guam volume decreased 3.7 percent primarily due to lower retail-related volume; and Other containers volume increased 11.4 percent. Ocean Transportation operating income increased 143.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher freight rates in China and a higher contribution from SSAT, partially offset by lower volume in China, higher operating costs and expenses (including fuel-related expenses) primarily due to the CLX+ service and higher terminal handling costs. The Company s SSAT terminal joint venture investment contributed 83.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a contribution of 56.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.

Table of Contents 
 year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 46.9 million in the prior year. Cash distributions from SSAT are dependent on the level of cash available for distribution after SSAT s operational and capital needs. Changes in accounts receivable were primarily due to lower accounts receivables outstanding at the end of December 31, 2022, due to lower revenue at the end of the year as compared to prior year, and the timing of collections associated with those receivables. Changes in prepaid expenses and other assets were primarily due to increased prepaid fuel, insurance and other operating related costs, primarily due to an increase in the cost for such expenses, and prepaid income taxes primarily due to the use of the CCF fund during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year. Changes in accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities were primarily due to a decrease in operating activity resulting in a reduction of operating costs and the timing of payments associated with those liabilities. Changes in operating lease liabilities were primarily due to new operating lease additions partially offset by operating leases that expired during the year ended December 31, 2022. Deferred dry-docking payments were 25.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 36.3 million in the prior year. The decrease in deferred dry-docking payments was due to a decrease in vessel dry-dock related activities during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year. (2) Changes in Net Cash Used in Investing Activities: Changes in net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:

The increase in capitalized vessel construction expenditures (including cash and interest deposited into the CCF less cash withdrawals from the CCF which are used for vessel construction related payments) was due to the commencement of the Company s new fleet renewal program in 2022. Capitalized vessel construction expenditures incurred in 2022 related to milestone payments on the construction of three new vessels and the construction of a new flat-deck barge. Other capital expenditures (excluding capitalized vessel construction expenditures) was 146.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 310.4 million for the prior year.

 Capital Construction Fund: The Company utilizes its CCF to fund milestone payments for the construction of new vessels. The Company s CCF is described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash on deposit in the CCF and assigned accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows: 

As of December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 Capital Construction Fund: Cash on deposit 518.2 Assigned accounts receivables 9.9 9.8 During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company deposited 582.8 million and 31.2 million into the CCF, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company made withdrawals of 64.6 million and 31.2 million out of the CCF, respectively, which were used to make milestone payments for the construction of new vessels. Cash on deposit in the CCF is held in short term U.S. Treasury Obligation Funds and classified as a long-term asset in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets, as the Company intends to use qualified cash withdrawals from the CCF to fund long-term investments in the construction of new vessels. Assigned accounts receivable in the CCF are classified as part of accounts receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets due to the nature of the assignment. On February 17, 2023, the Company pledged an additional 200.0 million of eligible accounts receivables to the CCF, and deposited an additional 100.0 million of cash into the CCF. Debt: The Company utilizes a mix of fixed and variable debt for liquidity and to fund the Company s operations. Total debt as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows: 

As of December 31, (In millions) 2022 2021 Change Fixed interest debt 517.5 629.0 (111.5) Total Debt 517.5 629.0 (111.5) Total debt decreased by 111.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year. The decrease in fixed interest debt was due to the prepayment of 50.4 million of outstanding principal of private placement term loans and scheduled debt repayments of private placement term loans and Title XI debt made during the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 642.1 million of unused capacity under the revolving credit facility, with a maturity date of March 31, 2026. The Company s debt is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. On January 27, 2023, the Company prepaid 14.3 million of outstanding principal on the Maunawili Title XI Bonds representing all of the remaining outstanding principal for this bond. The Company is also expecting to prepay the outstanding principal of approximately 12.1 million Manukai Title XI Bonds in March 2023, representing all of the estimated outstanding principal for this bond. The Company s Title XI Bonds are described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below. Working Capital: The Company had a working capital surplus of 178.0 million at December 31, 2022, compared to a working capital surplus of 92.1 million at December 31, 2021. Working capital is primarily impacted by the amount of net cash provided by operating activities, the amount of capital expenditures, the amount and timing of collections associated with accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, and by the amount and timing of payments associated with accounts payable, accruals, income taxes, debt and other liabilities. The increase in the Company s working capital surplus during the year ended December 31, 2022 was due to the increase in cash provided by operating activities.

 Capital Expenditures: The Company expects to make the following capital expenditures during the years ending December 31, 2023, 2024 and 2025: 

Expected Capital Expenditures (in millions) 2023 2024 2025 New vessel construction milestone payments and related costs 55 75 360 LNG installations and reengining on existing vessels 60 - 65 50 - 55 - Maintenance and other capital expenditures 80 - 90 80 - 90 80 - 90 Total Estimated Capital Expenditures 195 - 210 205 - 220 440 - 450 New vessel construction milestone payments and related costs are for the Company s new vessel program for the construction of three new vessels at a cost of approximately 1.0 billion with expected delivery dates during the fourth quarter of 2026, the second quarter of 2027 and the fourth quarter of 2027. Future milestone payments are expected to be financed with cash currently on deposit in the Company s CCF, cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and through cash flows generated from future operations, borrowings available under the Company s unsecured revolving credit facility or additional debt financings . LNG installations on existing vessels includes capital expenditures for the installation of tanks, piping and cryogenic equipment on existing Aloha Class vessels so that they can operate on LNG and conventional fuels. The LNG installation project on Daniel K. Inouye has begun and work on Kaimana Hila is currently scheduled to begin during the second quarter of 2024. Each installation is expected to cost approximately 35 million. Additionally, the Company plans to begin reengining Manukai to operate on LNG and conventional fuels during the second quarter of 2023 at a total cost of approximately 60 million. Maintenance and other capital expenditures include amounts that the Company expects to spend on various capital projects including capital expenditures related to the second and third phase of its program to modernize and renovate its terminal facility at Sand Island, Honolulu, Hawaii, repurchases of leased equipment, vessel maintenance and annual equipment purchases to support the Company s operations. Repurchase of Shares: During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased approximately 5.0 million shares for a total cost of 397.0 million. The maximum remaining number of shares that may be repurchased under the Company s stock repurchase program was 1,533,371 shares at December 31, 2022. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Commitments and Contingencies: A description of other commitments and contingencies is set forth in Note 9, Note 11 and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below, and is incorporated herein by reference. Off-balance sheet Arrangements: The Company is not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below. The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, upon which the Company s Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based, requires that management exercise judgment when making accounting estimates about future events that may affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and actual results will, inevitably, differ from those accounting estimates. These differences could be material. The Company considers an accounting estimate to be critical if (i)(a) the accounting estimate requires the Company to make assumptions that are difficult or subjective about matters that were highly uncertain at the time that the accounting estimate was made, (b) changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur in periods after the period in which the estimate was made, or (c) use of different estimates by the Company could have been used; and (ii) changes in those accounting estimates would have had a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the

 Company. The critical accounting policies and estimates inherent in the preparation of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements are described below. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill: The Company evaluates its long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. The Company has reporting units within the Ocean Transportation and Logistics reportable segments. Long-lived Assets and Finite-lived Intangible Assets: Long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available. In evaluating for impairment, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by each of these asset groups are compared with the carrying value recorded for each asset group to determine if its carrying value is recoverable. If this review determines that the amount recorded will not be recovered, the amount recorded for the asset group is reduced to its estimated fair value. These asset impairment analyses are highly subjective because they require management to make assumptions and apply considerable judgments to, among other things, estimates of the timing and amount of future cash flows, expected useful lives of the assets, potential impact of future events, including changes in economic conditions and operating performance, and future costs of maintenance and improvements of the assets. If management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods, the Company s financial condition or its future operating results could be materially impacted. The Company has evaluated its long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment and determined that there was no impairment for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Indefinite-life Intangible Assets and Goodwill: The Company s intangible assets include goodwill, customer relationships and a trade name, and are grouped at the lowest level reporting unit for which identifiable cash flows are available. In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit, the Company uses a combination of a discounted cash flow model and fair value based on market multiples of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ). The discounted cash flow approach requires the Company to use a number of assumptions, including market factors specific to the business, the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows generated by the business over an extended period of time, long-term growth rates for the business, and a discount rate that considers the risks related to the amount and timing of the cash flows. Although the assumptions used by the Company in its discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions the Company used to generate its internal strategic plans and forecasts, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from the reporting unit and the risk of achieving those cash flows. When using market multiples of EBITDA, the Company makes judgments about the comparability of multiples in closed and proposed transactions. Accordingly, changes in assumptions and estimates, including, but not limited to, changes driven by external factors, such as industry and economic trends, and those driven by internal factors, such as changes in the Company s business strategy and its internal forecasts, could have a material effect on the Company s financial condition or its future operating results. The Company has evaluated its indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill for impairment and determined that there was no impairment for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Insurance Related Liabilities: The Company is uninsured for certain risks but when feasible, many of these risks are mitigated by insurance. The Company purchases insurance with deductibles or self-insured retentions. Such insurance includes, but is not limited to, employee health, workers compensation, marine liability, cybersecurity, auto liability and physical damage to property and equipment. For certain risks, the Company elects to not purchase insurance because of the excessive cost of such insurance or the perceived remoteness of the risk. In addition, the Company retains all risk of loss that exceeds the limits of the Company s insurance policies, or for other risks where insurance is not commercially available. When estimating its reserves for retained risks and related liabilities, the Company considers a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors, current trends, and analyses provided by independent third parties. Periodically, management reviews its assumptions and estimates used to determine the adequacy of the Company s reserves for retained risks and other related liabilities. The Company s retained risks and other related liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to apply judgment and make long-term assumptions to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims, and of claims incurred but not reported, as of the balance sheet date. Insurance related liabilities were 45.4 million and 35.9 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company s estimate of insurance related liabilities could change if management uses different assumptions or if 
 37 

Table of Contents 
 different conditions occur in future periods, however the Company does not expect any such change would have a material impact on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. Pension and Post-Retirement Plans: The estimation of the Company s pension and post-retirement benefit expenses and liabilities requires the Company to make various assumptions. These assumptions include factors such as discount rates, expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, salary growth, health care cost trend rates, inflation, retirement rates, mortality rates and expected contributions. Actual results that differ from the assumptions made could materially affect the Company s financial condition or its future operating results. The effects of changing assumptions are included in unamortized net gains and losses, which directly affect accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Additionally, these unamortized gains and losses are amortized and reclassified to income (loss) over future periods. Additional information about the Company s pension and post-retirement plans and assumptions used is included in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below. Income Taxes: The Company s income tax expense requires the Company to make various estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of taxable income, tax credits, tax benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue, costs and expenses for tax purposes. The calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be impacted by various factors including but not limited to changes in tax rates; changes in tax laws, regulations, and rulings; changes in interpretations of existing tax laws, regulations and rulings; and changes in the evaluation of the Company s ability to realize deferred tax assets including operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to the Company s income taxes in a subsequent period. The Company records a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a recorded deferred tax asset would not be realized in future periods. Additional information about the Company s income taxes is included in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Debt and Interest Rate Risks: The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities used to maintain liquidity and to fund business operations, including borrowings under its revolving credit facility, private placement term loans and Title XI debt. In order to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates, the Company utilizes a balanced mix of both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt with various maturity dates. The nature and amount of the Company s outstanding debt are expected to fluctuate as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Other than in certain events of default, the Company is not obligated to prepay its variable and fixed rate debt prior to maturity. For fixed rate debt, changes in market interest rates would not affect the Company s financial condition or results of operations. Interest on certain borrowings under the Company s revolving credit facility is calculated using the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR ). LIBOR will be discontinued as a benchmark interest rate by mid-2023. The discontinuation of LIBOR will require the Company and its lenders to transition from LIBOR to a new benchmark interest rate, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). The Company believes that the transition to SOFR will not have a material impact on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. Additional information about the Company s debt is included in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below. Investment Risks: The Company invests excess cash in short-term money market funds that purchase government securities or corporate debt securities, or in other deposit products allowed under the Company s Cash Investment Policy. These money market funds and deposits maintain a weighted average maturity of less than 90 days, and 
 38

 accordingly, a one percent change in interest rates is not expected to have a material impact on the fair value of these investments or on interest income. The Company may invest funds on deposit in the CCF in money market funds, U.S. Treasury Obligation Funds or other eligible investments. Foreign Currency Risks: The Company has no material exposure to foreign currency risks, although it is indirectly affected by changes in currency rates to the extent that changes in rates affect tourism in Hawaii, Guam, Alaska and other locations. Transactions related to the Company s China and Japan services are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore, a one percent change in the Chinese Yuan or Japanese Yen exchange rate would not have a material effect on the Company s results of operations. Transactions related to the Company s South Pacific service are primarily denominated in New Zealand dollars. However, a one percent change in the New Zealand dollar exchange rate is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s results of operations.

 MANAGEMENT S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The management of Matson, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company has the responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company s Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that: Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the company; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting only provides reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement presentation and preparation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on its assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective. The Company s independent registered public accounting firm, , has issued an attestation report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting. /s/ Matthew J. Cox /s/ Joel M.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and the shareholders of Matson, Inc. Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Matson, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions . Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that 
 42 

Table of Contents 
 are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Goodwill Span Alaska Reporting Unit Refer to Notes 2 and 6 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit, the Company uses a combination of a discounted cash flow model and fair value based on market multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ). The discounted cash flow approach requires the Company to make several business assumptions, including, but not limited to, the discount rate. Changes in assumptions and estimates could have a material effect on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. The goodwill balance was 327.8 million as of December 31, 2022, of which 78.6 million is allocated to a reporting unit in the Logistics reportable segment, resulting from the acquisition of Span Intermediate, LLC Span Alaska in fiscal year 2016. The Company has evaluated its goodwill for impairment as part of its annual assessment in fiscal year 2022 and determined that the fair value of the Span Alaska reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount as of the date of the impairment review. We identified goodwill related to Span Alaska as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions management made to estimate the fair value of Span Alaska. Specifically, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management s estimates and assumptions related to the selection of the discount rate required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the selection of the discount rate for Span Alaska included the following, among others: We tested the effectiveness of controls over management s goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the selection of the discount rate. With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rate, including testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate, testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation, and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.

Contingencies: Contingencies and other litigation related matters are described as follows: Environmental Matters: The Company s Ocean Transportation segment has certain risks that could result in expenditures for environmental remediation. On November 10, 2021, the California Air Resources Board CARB issued a Notice of Violation (the NOV to Matson for alleged violations of the Airborne Toxic Control Measure for Auxiliary Diesel Engines Operated on Ocean-Going Vessels At-Berth in a California Port pursuant to California Code of Regulations, title 17, section 93118.3. CARB regulations require that a company s fleet plug into shore power for at least 80 percent of visits at California ports and reduce auxiliary engine power generation by at least 80 percent. The NOV alleges that Matson s fleet did not meet the 80 percent thresholds during visits to the Port of Long Beach in 2020. The violations were alleged to have been incurred by chartered vessels in the CLX+ service. These chartered vessels were not outfitted with alternative maritime power AMP capability which would have allowed them to plug into the shore power grid and shut down the vessel diesel generators when at dock. The Company has presented mitigating factors for consideration in settlement discussions with CARB as well as plans to achieve compliance. Although potential penalties for 2020, 2021 and 2022 violations could, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to exceed 1 million, they are not expected to be material to the Company s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Other Matters: The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to, or may be contingently liable in connection with, other legal actions arising in the normal course of their businesses, the outcomes of which, in the opinion of management after consultation with counsel, would not have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Unless the L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Lender, the Agent or the Borrower, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Article IV shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower or the applicable Subsidiary or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the L/C Issuer s usual and customary business practices.

(iii) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole discretion, agree to issue a 
 28 

Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit the L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the Non-Extension Notice Date in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided , however , that the L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) the L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) or (iii) of Section 2.03(a) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from the Agent, any Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the L/C Issuer not to permit such extension. (iv) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that permits the automatic reinstatement of all or a portion of the stated amount thereof after any drawing thereunder (each, an Auto-Reinstatement Letter of Credit ). Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer to permit such reinstatement. Once an Auto-Reinstatement Letter of Credit has been issued, except as provided in the following sentence, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to reinstate all or a portion of the stated amount thereof in accordance with the provisions of such Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such Auto-Reinstatement Letter of Credit permits the L/C Issuer to decline to reinstate all or any portion of the stated amount thereof after a drawing thereunder by giving notice of such non-reinstatement within a specified number of days after such drawing (the Non-Reinstatement Deadline ), the L/C Issuer shall not permit such reinstatement if it has received a notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven Business Days before the Non-Reinstatement Deadline (A) from the Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such reinstatement or (B) from the Agent, any Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied (treating such reinstatement as an L/C Credit Extension for purposes of this clause) and, in each case, directing the L/C Issuer not to permit such reinstatement. 
 29 

(v) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Borrower and the Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment and any other Issuer Documents related thereto. (c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations . (i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall notify the Borrower and the Agent thereof. Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an Honor Date ), the Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing; provided that the Borrower has received notice of such payment by 9:00 a.m. on such Honor Date, otherwise the Borrower shall make such payment not later than 11:00 a.m. on the following Business Day (together with interest thereon). If the Borrower fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the Unreimbursed Amount ), and the amount of such Lender s Applicable Percentage thereof. In such event, and in lieu of the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer as provided in the two immediately preceding sentences, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a Committed Loan Notice). Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or the Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. (ii) Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available (and the Agent may apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose) for the account of the L/C Issuer at the Agent s Office in an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii) , each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Agent shall remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer. (iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such 
 30

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Autoborrow Agreement is in effect, Swing Line Loans made pursuant to such Autoborrow Agreement shall bear interest at such other rate per annum as may be provided for in such Autoborrow Agreement. (b) (i) If any amount of principal of any Loan is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws. (ii) If any amount (other than principal of any Loan) payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then upon the request of the Required Lenders, such overdue amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws. (iii) Upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of Default exists (other than as set forth in clauses (b)(i) and (b)(ii) above), the Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws. (iv) Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand. (c) Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein.

In addition to certain fees described in subsections (i) and (j) of Section 2.03 : (a) Commitment Fee . The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, a commitment fee equal to the product of the Applicable Rate times the actual daily amount by which the Aggregate Commitments exceed 
 41 

the sum of (i) the Outstanding Amount of Committed Loans and (ii) the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.16 . For the avoidance of doubt, the Outstanding Amount of Swing Line Loans shall not be counted towards or considered usage of the Aggregate Commitments for purposes of determining the commitment fee. The commitment fee shall accrue at all times during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the last day of the Availability Period, including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article IV is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the last day of the Availability Period. The commitment fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. (b) Other Fees . (i) The Borrower shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Arranger and the Agent for their own accounts fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever. (ii) The Borrower shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Lenders such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever. 2.10 Computation of Interest and Fees; Retroactive Adjustment of Applicable Rate . (a) All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to Term SOFR) shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.12(a) , bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (b) If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of the Borrower or for any other reason, the Borrower or the Lenders determine that (i) the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio as calculated by the Borrower as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, the Borrower shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, promptly on demand by the Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, automatically and without further action by the Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period. This paragraph shall not limit the rights of the Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under Section 
 42 

2.03(c)(iii) , 2.03(i) or 2.08(b) or under Article VIII . The Borrower s obligations under this paragraph shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment of all other Obligations hereunder. 2.11 Evidence of Debt . (a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender s Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. (b) In addition to the accounts and records referred to in subsection (a), each Lender and the Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. 2.12 Payments Generally; Agent s Clawback . (a) General . All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made free and clear of and without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Agent s Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date specified herein. The Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender s Lending Office. All payments received by the Agent after 11:00 a.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be. (b) (i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Agent . Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Committed Borrowing of Term SOFR Loans (or, in the case of any Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 p.m. on the date of such Committed Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Agent such Lender s share of such Committed Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Committed Borrowing of 
 43 

Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing available to the Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing to the Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender s Committed Loan included in such Committed Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Agent. (ii) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Agent . Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. With respect to any payment that the Agent makes for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder as to which the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that any of the following applies (such payment referred to as the Rescindable Amount ): (1) the Borrower has not in fact made such payment; (2) the Agent has made a payment in excess of the amount so paid by the Borrower (whether or not then owed); or (3) the Agent has for any reason otherwise erroneously made such payment; then each of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand the Rescindable Amount so distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. A notice of the Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. (c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent . If any Lender makes available to the Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II , and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in 
 44 

accordance with the terms hereof, the Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. (d) Obligations of Lenders Several . The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Committed Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Committed Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Committed Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c) . (e) Funding Source . Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 2.13 Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Committed Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations or in Swing Line Loans held by it resulting in such Lender s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Committed Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Committed Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Committed Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that: (i) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and (ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (y) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in Section 2.15 , or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Committed Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans to any assignee or participant, other than an assignment to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against any Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation. 2.14 Increases of Aggregate Commitments . 
 45 

The Borrower shall have the right, upon at least five Business Days prior written notice to the Agent, to increase the Aggregate Commitments by up to 250,000,000 in the aggregate in one or more increases, at any time prior to the date that is three months prior to the Maturity Date, subject , however , in any such case, to satisfaction of the following conditions precedent: (a) the Aggregate Commitments shall not exceed 900,000,000 without the consent of the Required Lenders; (b) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date on which such increase is to become effective; (c) the representations and warranties set forth in Article V shall be true and correct in all material respects (or, if such representation or warranty is qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect, it shall be true and correct in all respects as drafted) on and as of the date on which such increase is to become effective, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct in all material respects (or, if such representation or warranty is qualified by materiality or material adverse effect, it shall be true and correct in all respects as drafted) as of such earlier date; (d) such increase shall be in a minimum amount of 10,000,000, or such lesser amount equal to the remaining available increase amount, and in integral multiples of 1,000,000 in excess thereof; (e) such requested increase shall only be effective upon receipt by the Agent of (i) additional Commitments in a corresponding amount of such requested increase from either existing Lenders and/or one or more other institutions that qualify as Eligible Assignees (it being understood and agreed that no existing Lender shall be required to provide an additional Commitment) and (ii) documentation from each institution providing an additional Commitment evidencing its additional Commitment and its obligations under this Agreement in form and substance acceptable to the Agent; (f) the Agent shall have received all documents (including resolutions of the board of directors of the Loan Parties and opinions of counsel to the Loan Parties) it may reasonably request relating to the corporate or other necessary authority for such increase and the validity of such increase in the Aggregate Commitments, and any other matters relevant thereto, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent (it being understood that such documents will be limited, if applicable, to an officer s certificate to the effect that the board resolutions of the Loan Parties adopted on or prior to the Closing Date and delivered pursuant to Section 4.01(a)(ii) remain in full force and effect and have not been modified); and (g) if any Committed Loans are outstanding at the time of the increase in the Aggregate Commitments, the Borrower shall, if applicable, prepay one or more existing Committed Loans (such prepayment to be subject to Section 3.05 in an amount necessary such that after giving effect to the increase in the Aggregate Commitments, each Lender will hold its pro rata share (based on its Applicable Percentage of the increased Aggregate Commitments) of outstanding Committed Loans. 2.15 Cash Collateral . (a) Certain Credit Support Events . If (i) the L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C 
 46 

Borrowing, (ii) as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, (iii) the Borrower shall be required to provide Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 8.02(c) , or (iv) there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, the Borrower shall immediately (in the case of clause (iii) above) or within one Business Day (in all other cases) following any request by the Agent or the L/C Issuer, provide Cash Collateral in an amount not less than the applicable Minimum Collateral Amount (determined in the case of Cash Collateral provided pursuant to clause (iv) above, after giving effect to Section 2.16(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender). For purposes of clarification, if Fronting Exposure remains after giving effect to Section 2.16(a)(iv) , the Agent shall first request that the Defaulting Lender deliver to the Agent Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to cover the remaining Fronting Exposure and, second , to the extent Fronting Exposure remains after giving effect to Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender, the Agent shall request that the Borrower deliver to the Agent Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to cover the remaining Fronting Exposure. Such Cash Collateralization may be effected by means of a Borrowing of Committed Loans or a funding of participation interests (assuming for such purposes that the Letters of Credit that will survive the Maturity Date had been fully drawn on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date). (b) Grant of Security Interest . All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at Bank of America. As of the Closing Date, the Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) the Agent, for the benefit of the Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to Section 2.15(c) . If at any time the Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Agent or the L/C Issuer as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the relevant Defaulting Lender and, to the extent Fronting Exposure remains thereafter, the Borrower will promptly upon demand by the Agent, pay or provide to the Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency. The relevant Defaulting Lender or, to the extent not paid by the relevant Defaulting Lender, the Borrower, shall pay on demand therefor from time to time all customary account opening, activity and other administrative fees and charges in connection with the maintenance and disbursement of Cash Collateral. (c) Application . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this Section 2.15 or Sections 2.03 , 2.04 , 2.05 , 2.16 or 8.02 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific L/C Obligations, obligations to fund participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein. (d) Release . Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure or to secure other obligations shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with Section 10.06(b)(vi) )) or (ii) the Agent s and the L/C Issuer s good faith determination that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided , however , (x) that Cash Collateral furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower shall not be released during the continuance of a Default (and following application as provided in this Section 2.15 may be 
 47 

otherwise applied in accordance with Section 8.03 ), and (y) the Person providing Cash Collateral and the L/C Issuer, as applicable, may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations. Between a Defaulting Lender and the Borrower as to any particular Cash Collateral, the Cash Collateral furnished by the Borrower shall be released prior to any Cash Collateral furnished by the Defaulting Lender. 2.16 Defaulting Lenders . (a) Adjustments . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law: (i) Waivers and Amendments .

Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VIII or otherwise) or received by the Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 10.08 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Agent as follows: first , to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Agent hereunder; second , to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder; third , to Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuer s Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 2.15 ; fourth , as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Agent; fifth , if so determined by the Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lender s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuer s future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 2.15 ; sixth , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh , so long as no Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth , to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Borrowings in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the 
 48 

conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Obligations owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Obligations owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments hereunder without giving effect to Section 2.16(a)(iv) . Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.16(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. (iii) Certain Fees .

(iv) Reallocation of Applicable Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure . All or any part of such Defaulting Lender s participation in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender s Commitment) but only to the extent that such reallocation does not cause any Non-Defaulting Lender s share of the Total Outstandings to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender s Commitment. Subject to Section 10.19 , no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation. 
 49

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Agent), or by the Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each of the Loan Parties shall, and does hereby, jointly and severally indemnify the Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender or the L/C Issuer for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Agent as required pursuant to Section 3.01(c)(ii) below.

Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the Closing Date. (iii) Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section 3.01 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. (iv) For purposes of this Section 3.01(e) , the term Lender includes any L/C Issuer. (f) Treatment of Certain Refunds . Unless required by applicable laws, at no time shall the Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or the L/C Issuer, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be. If any Recipient determines that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Loan Party or with respect to which any Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01 , it shall pay to the Loan Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by a Loan Party under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Loan Party, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to the Loan Party pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the indemnification 
 54 

payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person.

Each party s obligations under this Section 3.01 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations. 3.02 Illegality. If any Lender determines that any law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund or charge interest with respect to any Credit Extension or to determine or charge interest rates based upon Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate, then, upon notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower (through the Agent), (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Term SOFR Loans, to make Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate Loans, or to convert Base Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans shall be suspended and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender, shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (A) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Term SOFR Loans or Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate), either (1) if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans to such day, on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, (2) if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans to the last day of the Interest Period therefor, on the last day that such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans or (3) immediately, in the case of Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate Loans and (B) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate, the Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Term SOFR component thereof until the Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. 3.03 Inability to Determine Rates. (a) If in connection with any request for a Term SOFR Loan or Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof, (i) the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (A) no Successor Rate has been determined in accordance with Section 3.03(b) , and the circumstances under clause (i) of Section 3.03(b) or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred (as applicable) or (B) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining (1) Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Term SOFR Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan or (2) the Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate for an existing or proposed Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate Loan or (ii) (A) the Agent or the Required Lenders determine that for any reason that Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Term SOFR Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, in each case, the Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender or (B) the Swing Line 
 55 

Lender determines that for any reason the Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate with respect to a proposed Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate Loan or in connection with a Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Swing Line Lender of funding such Swing Line Loan, in each case, the Swing Line Lender will promptly so notify the Borrower and the Agent. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Term SOFR Loans of the type covered by the Agent s notice shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans or Interest Periods), (y) the obligation of the Swing Line Lender to make or maintain Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate Loans shall be suspended and (z) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Term SOFR component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Agent (or, in the case of a determination by the Required Lenders described in clause (ii of this Section 3.03(a ), until the Agent upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower may (A) revoke any pending request for a Committed Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Loans (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein or (B) revoke any pending request for a Swing Line Borrowing of Term SOFR Daily Floating Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Daily Floating Loans) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Swing Line Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein and (ii) any outstanding Term SOFR Loans shall be deemed to have been converted to Base Rate Loans at the end of their respective applicable Interest Period. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Borrower or Required Lenders notify the Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a copy to the Borrower) that the Borrower or Required Lenders (as applicable) have determined, that: (i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining one month and three month interest periods of Term SOFR, including, without limitation, because the Term SOFR Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or (ii) CME or any successor the administrator of the Term SOFR Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Agent or such administrator with respect to its publication of Term SOFR, in each case acting in such capacity, has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which one month and three month interest periods of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate shall or will no longer be made available, or permitted to be used for determining the interest rate of Dollar denominated syndicated loans, or shall or will otherwise cease, provided that , at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Agent, that will continue to provide such interest periods of Term SOFR after such specific date (the latest date on which one month and three month interest periods of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate are no longer available permanently or indefinitely, the Scheduled Unavailability Date then, on a date and time determined by the Agent (any such date, the Term SOFR Replacement Date ), which date shall be at the end of an Interest Period or on the relevant interest payment date, as applicable, for interest calculated and, solely with respect to clause (ii) above, no later than the Scheduled Unavailability Date, Term SOFR will be replaced hereunder and under any 
 56 

Loan Document with Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment for any payment period for interest calculated that can be determined by the Agent, in each case, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document (the Successor Rate ). If the Successor Rate is Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment, all interest payments will be payable on a quarterly basis. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if the Agent determines that Daily Simple SOFR is not available on or prior to the Term SOFR Replacement Date, or (ii) if the events or circumstances of the type described in Section 3.03(b)(i) or (ii) have occurred with respect to the Successor Rate then in effect, then in each case, the Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing Term SOFR or any then current Successor Rate in accordance with this Section 3.03 at the end of any Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period for interest calculated, as applicable, with an alternative benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar Dollar denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such alternative benchmark. and, in each case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar Dollar denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such benchmark, which adjustment or method for calculating such adjustment shall be published on an information service as selected by the Agent from time to time in its reasonable discretion and may be periodically updated. For the avoidance of doubt, any such proposed rate and adjustments, shall constitute a Successor Rate . Any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Agent written notice that such Required Lenders object to such amendment. The Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify the Borrower and each Lender of the implementation of any Successor Rate. Any Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Agent, such Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Agent. Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any Successor Rate as so determined would otherwise be less than zero, the Successor Rate will be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. In connection with the implementation of a Successor Rate, the Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement; provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to the Borrower and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective. For purposes of this Section 3.03 , those Lenders that either have not made, or do not have an obligation under this Agreement to make, the relevant Loans in Dollars shall be excluded from any determination of Required Lenders.

A certificate of a Lender or the L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

 58

Upon completion of the trial run, the BUILDER shall give the BUYER written notice of completion of the trial run along with copies of all sea trial test reports, including if the BUILDER considers that the results of the trial run indicate the conformity of the VESSEL to this Contract and the Specification. The BUYER shall, within three (3) days after receipt of such notice from the BUILDER, provide the BUILDER written notice of its intent to accept or reject the VESSEL on the Delivery Date. b. However, should the results of the trial run indicate that the VESSEL, or any part or equipment thereof, does not conform to the requirements of this Contract and/or the Specification, or if the BUILDER is in agreement as to non-conformity as specified in the BUYER s notice of rejection, then, the BUILDER shall with the written concurrence of the BUYER take the necessary steps to correct such non-conformity. Upon completion of correction and testing of such non-conformity, the BUILDER shall give the BUYER written notice thereof. The BUYER shall, within two (2) days after receipt of such notice from the BUILDER, notify the 
 17 

BUILDER of its acceptance or rejection of the VESSEL. The BUYER may only demand a new trial run if this is the only way the BUILDER can prove that the nonconformities have been corrected. In the event a new trial run takes place, the provisions set forth in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 hereof shall govern this trial run except that the BUILDER shall be entitled to give a written notice of two (2) days for such new trial run. Upon completion of the additional trial run, the provisions of this Paragraph 4 shall apply. c. In any event that the BUYER rejects the VESSEL, the BUYER shall specify in its notice of rejection in what respect the VESSEL, or any part or equipment thereof does not conform to this Contract. d. In the event that the BUYER fails to provide the BUILDER written notice of the acceptance of or the rejection together with the reason therefor of the VESSEL within the period as provided in the above subparagraphs (a) or (b), the BUYER shall be deemed to have accepted the VESSEL. e. The BUILDER may dispute the rejection of the VESSEL by the BUYER under this Paragraph 4, in which case the matter shall be submitted for final decision in accordance with Article XIV hereof. 5.

The BUYER shall not refuse formal delivery of the VESSEL as hereinafter provided, if the BUILDER complies with all other procedural requirements for delivery as provided in Article VII hereof. b. If minor work or items on the VESSEL are incomplete or missing when the VESSEL otherwise is ready for delivery and such work or items do not materially affect the operation, trade or schedule of the VESSEL nor are likely to cause damage or excessive deterioration to the VESSEL or void warranty requirements, the BUYER shall not withhold its consent to accept delivery of the VESSEL subject to the right of the BUYER to have such items completed by the BUILDER in a reasonable manner and period of time. The parties shall on delivery execute a protocol of outstanding work and a schedule for completion of such work or agree as to an adjustment of the Contract Price in lieu of completion of such work. The BUILDER agrees that any such monetary payments to and repairs done by BUYER shall not void the BUILDER s or any manufacturer s warranties. ARTICLE VII DELIVERY 1. Time and Place: a. The VESSEL shall be delivered by the BUILDER to the BUYER at the Shipyard or at another location acceptable to both parties hereto. The original Delivery Date 
 18 

for the VESSEL shall be October [ ], 2026 (herein called the Original Delivery Date ). b.

Unless waived by the BUYER, the VESSEL shall not be deemed to be substantially complete if a delivery deficiency will require the VESSEL to be taken out of service prior to the VESSEL S regular maintenance schedule or if the aggregate value of such delivery deficiencies is in excess of [ ]. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Classification Society issues a 
 19 

Certificate of Class with a condition of class, the BUYER shall not be obligated to accept the VESSEL with such condition of class. b. Provided that the BUYER shall have fulfilled all of its obligations stipulated under this Contract, delivery of the VESSEL shall be effected forthwith by the concurrent delivery by each of the parties hereto to the other of the PROTOCOL OF DELIVERY AND ACCEPTANCE, acknowledging delivery of the VESSEL by the BUILDER and acceptance thereof by the BUYER.

 22 

subcontractor was reasonable and the BUILDER has exercised due diligence to monitor the actions and to expedite delivery of the vendor or to obtain substitute performance; prolonged failure or restriction of electric current or petroleum; non-delivery or late delivery of BUYER S Supplies to BUILDER S custody or other delay caused by any default or omission on the part of the BUYER in carrying out any of its obligations under this Contract; or destruction of or damage to the worksite or other works of the BUILDER, its main subcontractors or to the VESSEL or any part thereof, by any causes heretofore described in this Paragraph and any other causes properly to be considered to be beyond the BUILDER s reasonable control; provided that there shall be excluded any such causes that are in existence as of the date of execution of this Contract or as to a cause impacting a contractor or subcontractor, a cause known to the party as of the date of execution of the contract or subcontract. The Parties acknowledge the current world events surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine military conflict and agree that any future act, event, or circumstance caused by or arising from the COVID-19 pandemic or Russia-Ukraine military conflict otherwise meeting the definition of an event of Force Majeure is not excepted from that definition because of the duration and nature of the pandemic or the military conflict.

The effect of any changes in laws, lawful regulations, standards and written interpretations of the regulatory bodies between the effective date of this Contract and the delivery of the VESSEL shall be incorporated into this Contract by a Change Order under ARTICLE V. b. The expense of all changes to the VESSEL noted in the PROTOCOL OF DELIVERY AND ACCEPTANCE shall be for the account of the BUILDER, except as provided in subparagraph (a) of ARTICLE V, Paragraph 2. 2. Warranty: a . Subject to the provisions hereinafter set forth, the BUILDER undertakes to remedy, free of charge to the BUYER, any deficiency, defects, failure, breaking down or deterioration beyond that caused by ordinary wear and tear (jointly 
 24 

defects in the VESSEL which are due to defective material, faulty design and/or bad workmanship on the part of the BUILDER and/or its contractors or subcontractors, provided that the defects are discovered within a period of twelve (12) months after the date of delivery of the VESSEL (the Guarantee Period and a notice thereof is duly given to the BUILDER as hereinbelow provided. In computing the Guarantee Period there shall be excluded any time the VESSEL is prevented from entering or is taken out of service on account of any defect for which the BUILDER is responsible. For the purpose of this Article, the VESSEL shall include her hull, machinery, equipment and gear, but excludes any parts of the VESSEL that have been supplied by or on behalf of the BUYER. Upon expiration of the Guarantee Period, and to the extent permitted by vendors and subcontractors, the BUILDER agrees to transfer any guarantees or warranties supplied to it by vendors and subcontractors. b. The BUILDER s guarantee of the coatings shall be back to back with the guarantee of the coatings by the coatings manufacturer. During the Guarantee Period, the BUILDER shall be responsible for correction of paint defects in accordance with the guarantee of the coatings by the coatings manufacturer. After the expiration of the VESSEL Guarantee Period, the coating manufacturer s extended warranty shall be transferred to the BUYER under Article IX subparagraph 5d.

Notice of Defects: The BUYER shall notify the BUILDER in writing of any defects for which claim is made under this guarantee as promptly as possible after discovery thereof. If the defect was discovered during drydocking of the VESSEL, the BUYER must notify the BUILDER in time for the BUILDER to inspect the defect before the VESSEL leaves the drydock if this is necessary for a prudent inspection of the defect. The BUYER s written notice shall in sufficient detail describe the nature and extent of the defects. The BUILDER shall have no obligation for any defects discovered prior to the expiry date of the said twelve (12) months period, unless notice of such defects is received by the BUILDER not later than thirty (30) days after such expiry date. 4. Remedy of Defects: a. The BUILDER shall promptly remedy, at its expense, any defects, against which the VESSEL is guaranteed under this Article, by making all necessary repairs or replacements at the Shipyard, if practicable. Upon having remedied such defects the BUILDER shall give the BUYER a further guarantee period of six (6) months for the aforementioned repairs or replacements from the date such repair or replacement is accomplished, which extended period shall not reduce the original twelve (12) month Guarantee Period. b. However, if it is impractical to bring the VESSEL to the Shipyard, or if the BUILDER is unable to remedy the defects within a period of time satisfactory to the BUYER due to the BUILDER S or the VESSEL s working schedule or any other reason, the 
 25 

BUYER may cause the necessary repairs or replacements to be made elsewhere which is deemed suitable for the purpose, provided that, in such event, the BUILDER may forward or supply replacement parts or materials to the VESSEL, unless forwarding or supplying thereof to the VESSEL would impair or delay the operation or working schedule of the VESSEL. In the event that the BUYER proposes to cause the necessary repairs or replacements to be made to the VESSEL at any other shipyard or works than the Shipyard, the BUYER shall first, but in all events as soon as possible, give the BUILDER notice in writing of the time and place such repairs or replacements will be made, and if the VESSEL is not thereby delayed, or her operation or working schedule is not thereby impaired, the BUILDER shall have the right to verify by its own representative(s) the nature and extent of the defects complained of. The BUILDER shall, in such case, promptly advise the BUYER in writing, after such examination has been completed, of its acceptance or rejection of the defects as ones that are covered by the guarantee herein provided. Upon the BUILDER s acceptance of the defects as justifying remedy under this Article, or upon resolution of a dispute in accordance with the provisions of Article XIV hereof, the BUILDER shall immediately pay to the BUYER for such repairs or replacements the sum of BUYER S documented costs therefor up to a sum equal to the reasonable cost of making the same repairs or replacements in the Shipyard. Subject to a written agreement with the BUILDER, warranty repairs may be made by the crewmembers of the VESSEL, provided however that the BUYER submits documentation for the work performed and the BUILDER will not reimburse the BUYER at labor rates currently in excess of 68.00 per hour (as escalated at 2.5 per year after delivery). For the avoidance of doubt, if the BUILDER is unable to remedy the defects within a period of time satisfactory to BUYER due to the BUILDER S or the VESSEL s working schedule or any other reason, BUYER shall not be obligated to operate the VESSEL with a defect even if the Classification Society agrees that the Vessel may be operated with a condition of class, and the BUYER shall be entitled to cause the necessary repairs or replacements to be made as provided in this paragraph. c. In any case, the VESSEL shall be taken at the BUYER s cost, risk and responsibility to the place elected, ready in all respects for such repairs or replacements. Any preparation, draining of pipes, cleaning of spaces to make them accessible for warranty repairs, marine chemist s certificates, including gas free certificate shall be at the BUILDER s cost. d. If a defect cannot reasonably be corrected except by drydocking the VESSEL, the BUYER shall be entitled to postpone correction and repair until a subsequent drydocking of the VESSEL. The BUYER may withhold the estimated cost of correction and repair from the Guarantee Payment until such drydocking. e. Any dispute under this Article shall be referred to dispute resolution in accordance with the provisions of Article XIV hereof. 5. Extent of the BUILDER s Responsibility: a.

The BUILDER shall not be responsible for any defects in any part of the VESSEL which may subsequent to delivery of the VESSEL have been replaced or in any way repaired by any other contractor, or for any defects which have been caused or aggravated by omission or improper use and maintenance of the VESSEL on the part of the BUYER, its servants or agents or by ordinary wear and tear or by any other circumstances whatsoever beyond the control of the BUILDER. c. A final guaranty survey of the VESSEL shall be conducted by the BUYER at or near the expiration of the Guarantee Period. Such survey shall be based on the defects in the contract work appearing or discovered during the Guarantee Period. In the event that the VESSEL is not available for the guarantee survey on or before the end of the Guarantee Period, the BUYER promptly shall submit to the BUILDER a list of all of the defects in the contract work appearing or discovered during the Guarantee Period and all damage for which the BUILDER is liable under the provisions of this Article IX. The final guarantee survey shall be held at such port in the United States as the BUYER designates and seven (7) days written notice of time and place for such guarantee survey shall be given to the BUILDER by the BUYER. The BUILDER shall have the right to attend the guarantee survey. d.

The BUILDER shall advise the BUYER of the terms of any such guarantees that are assigned to the BUYER. e. The guarantee contained as hereinabove in this Article replaces and excludes any other liability, guarantee, warranty and/or condition imposed or implied by the law, customary, statutory or otherwise, by reason of the construction and sale of the VESSEL for and to the BUYER. THE BUILDER MAKES NO FURTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY 
 27 

OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS OF THE VESSEL, ITS MACHINERY OR EQUIPMENT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. f. The BUYER may withhold the Guarantee Payment and deposit the full amount into an escrow account as provided in Article II. The BUYER shall pay to the BUILDER the entire Guarantee Payment, less any amount to cover any outstanding defect, upon completion of the Guarantee Period for the VESSEL.

The theoretical calculation of the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) for the VESSEL at the Guaranteed Speed, together with all of the underlying assumptions with respect thereto, are set forth for informational purposes in Exhibit 8. BUILDER does not provide any guarantee with respect to the VESSEL being in compliance with the CII during operations. Early in the design process ship model tests shall be conducted to refine the hull form and improve the overall efficiency over the range of operating drafts and trims anticipated for the VESSEL for the intended service. Model tests shall be conducted at the drafts defined in the Specification but including the design draft, a deep ballast draft and the Summer Load Line draft. In addition, the model basin shall be tasked with providing a procedure for extrapolating the actual sea trial ship speed at a ballast condition to the speed at the design draft and main engine NCR power with [ ] sea margin. This procedure shall be submitted to the BUYER for approval along with the Model Test report. The sea trial test for determination and verification of the VESSEL s speed at the design draft and main engine NCR shall be based on the following: 1. The sea trial speed test shall be conducted in water with a depth greater than 100m and at a deep ballast draft corresponding to the model tests. 2. Weather and sea conditions shall be Beaufort 6 or less, subject to approval of both parties. 3. Assessment of the distance traveled for determining the performance speed shall be conducted by means of DGPS (Differential Global Positioning System). 4. The influence of rudder helm during the test shall be avoided. 5. The speed trial shall consist of runs in alternate directions at each of four power levels defined in the Specification. 6. Results of speed trial shall be corrected to calm water (no wind, no waves, no current) according to ISO 15016 Ships and Marine Technology Guidelines for the Assessment of Speed and Power Performance by Analysis of Speed Trial Data . 7. The results of the speed trial at the ballast condition shall be projected, based on the model test results and the procedure developed by the model basin and approved by BUYER, to determine the speed at the design draft and main engine NCR power level with [ ] sea margin.

It is agreed that, if during the trial run of the VESSEL, the weather should suddenly become so unfavorable that orderly conduct of the trial run can no longer be continued, the trial run shall be discontinued and postponed until the first favorable day next following, unless the BUYER shall assent in writing to acceptance of the VESSEL on the basis of the trial run already made before such discontinuance has occurred. Any delay of trial run caused by such unfavorable weather condition shall operate to postpone the Delivery Date by the period of delay involved and such delay shall be deemed 
 16 

as a Permissible Delay in the delivery of the VESSEL. Within twenty-four (24) hours from the cessation of a delay in the trial run caused by unfavorable weather, the BUILDER shall advise the BUYER in writing of the new proposed date for the trial run. 3. How Conducted: a. All expenses in connection with the trial run are to be for the account of the BUILDER and the BUILDER shall provide at its own expense the necessary crew to comply with conditions of safe navigation. The trial run shall be conducted in the manner prescribed in the Specification, and shall prove fulfillment of the performance requirements for the trial run as set forth in the Specification. The course of trial run shall be determined by the BUILDER. b. Notwithstanding the foregoing, fuel oil, LNG, lubricating oil, greases and fresh water necessary for the trial run of the VESSEL shall be supplied by the BUILDER at the Shipyard prior to the time of the trial run, and the BUYER shall pay the BUILDER upon delivery of the VESSEL (i) the cost of the quantities of fuel oil, lubricating oil, greases and fresh water not consumed during the trial run at the original purchase price, and (ii) the cost of all LNG (whether or not consumed during the trial run) at the original purchase price. In measuring the consumed quantity, lubricating oils and greases remaining in the main engine, other machinery and their pipes, stern tube and the like, shall be excluded. The BUILDER shall arrange for the quantity of fuel oil, LNG, lubricating oils, greases and fresh water to be loaded on the VESSEL at delivery in accordance with the instructions of the BUYER, at the BUYER S cost. The BUILDER shall remove all waste and debris about the VESSEL and all sludge and oily water wastes from the VESSEL prior to delivery, at the BUILDER S cost. The BUYER shall promptly reimburse the BUILDER for the cost of all LNG bunkering operations, including, without limitation, operational procedures, cleaning, and safety measures. 4. Method of Acceptance or Rejection: a. Upon completion of the trial run, the BUILDER shall give the BUYER written notice of completion of the trial run along with copies of all sea trial test reports, including if the BUILDER considers that the results of the trial run indicate the conformity of the VESSEL to this Contract and the Specification. The BUYER shall, within three (3) days after receipt of such notice from the BUILDER, provide the BUILDER written notice of its intent to accept or reject the VESSEL on the Delivery Date. b. However, should the results of the trial run indicate that the VESSEL, or any part or equipment thereof, does not conform to the requirements of this Contract and/or the Specification, or if the BUILDER is in agreement as to non-conformity as specified in the BUYER s notice of rejection, then, the BUILDER shall with the written concurrence of the BUYER take the necessary steps to correct such non-conformity. Upon completion of correction and testing of such non-conformity, the BUILDER shall give the BUYER written notice thereof. The BUYER shall, within two (2) days after receipt of such notice from the BUILDER, notify the 
 17 

BUILDER of its acceptance or rejection of the VESSEL. The BUYER may only demand a new trial run if this is the only way the BUILDER can prove that the nonconformities have been corrected. In the event a new trial run takes place, the provisions set forth in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 hereof shall govern this trial run except that the BUILDER shall be entitled to give a written notice of two (2) days for such new trial run. Upon completion of the additional trial run, the provisions of this Paragraph 4 shall apply. c. In any event that the BUYER rejects the VESSEL, the BUYER shall specify in its notice of rejection in what respect the VESSEL, or any part or equipment thereof does not conform to this Contract. d. In the event that the BUYER fails to provide the BUILDER written notice of the acceptance of or the rejection together with the reason therefor of the VESSEL within the period as provided in the above subparagraphs (a) or (b), the BUYER shall be deemed to have accepted the VESSEL. e. The BUILDER may dispute the rejection of the VESSEL by the BUYER under this Paragraph 4, in which case the matter shall be submitted for final decision in accordance with Article XIV hereof. 5. Effect of Acceptance: a. Acceptance of the VESSEL as above provided shall be final and binding and the VESSEL will be deemed to be in conformity with this Contract except as set forth in subparagraph b immediately below. The BUYER shall not refuse formal delivery of the VESSEL as hereinafter provided, if the BUILDER complies with all other procedural requirements for delivery as provided in Article VII hereof. b. If minor work or items on the VESSEL are incomplete or missing when the VESSEL otherwise is ready for delivery and such work or items do not materially affect the operation, trade or schedule of the VESSEL nor are likely to cause damage or excessive deterioration to the VESSEL or void warranty requirements, the BUYER shall not withhold its consent to accept delivery of the VESSEL subject to the right of the BUYER to have such items completed by the BUILDER in a reasonable manner and period of time. The parties shall on delivery execute a protocol of outstanding work and a schedule for completion of such work or agree as to an adjustment of the Contract Price in lieu of completion of such work. The BUILDER agrees that any such monetary payments to and repairs done by BUYER shall not void the BUILDER s or any manufacturer s warranties. ARTICLE VII DELIVERY 1. Time and Place: a. The VESSEL shall be delivered by the BUILDER to the BUYER at the Shipyard or at another location acceptable to both parties hereto. The original Delivery Date 
 18 

for the VESSEL shall be April [ ], 2027 (herein called the Original Delivery Date ). b. Delays on account of such causes which under the terms of this Contract permit the BUILDER to postpone the delivery of the VESSEL shall be understood to be Permissible Delay (herein called Permissible Delay ). c. The Original Delivery Date shall be adjusted by the total Permissible Delay and the adjusted date shall be the Delivery Date (herein called the Delivery Date ). The VESSEL shall be delivered by the BUILDER to the BUYER on or before the Delivery Date. d. The BUILDER advises that it has contracts committing the BUILDER to construct five training ships and up to two subsea rock installation vessels (the other contracts ). The BUILDER advises that the Original Delivery Date is being committed to taking into account BUILDER s obligations under the other contracts. The BUILDER agrees that its obligations under the other contracts and any delay in its deliveries under the other contracts would not constitute a Permissible Delay as defined in subparagraph b. of this Paragraph 1, or a Force Majeure event under Article VIII of this Contract, unless the conditions under Article VIII apply to or otherwise impact the facilities or workforce at the Shipyard available for the construction of the VESSEL under this Contract. 2. When and How Effected: a. When the work on the VESSEL is complete or substantially complete in accordance with this Contract and the VESSEL has passed the tests required by this Contract, the VESSEL as completed or substantially completed shall be delivered by the BUILDER and accepted by the BUYER alongside a safe and accessible pier at the Shipyard, or at such other place as may be mutually agreed to by the BUILDER and the BUYER, where there must be sufficient water for the VESSEL always to be afloat and during egress from the berth, custom to the contrary notwithstanding, free and clear of all liens, security interests, and claims of every nature, excepting, however those in favor of a claimant, other than BUILDER, arising out of the acts or omissions of the BUYER, with not less than ten (10) days prior written notice to the BUYER of such delivery. As used in this Contract, the term substantially complete shall mean complete except for minor items not affecting the commercial utility and safe operation of the VESSEL, with all certificates required for operation of the VESSEL, and not violating any requirement of a regulatory body. Unless waived by the BUYER, the VESSEL shall not be deemed to be substantially complete if a delivery deficiency will require the VESSEL to be taken out of service prior to the VESSEL S regular maintenance schedule or if the aggregate value of such delivery deficiencies is in excess of [ ]. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Classification Society issues a 
 19 

Certificate of Class with a condition of class, the BUYER shall not be obligated to accept the VESSEL with such condition of class. b. Provided that the BUYER shall have fulfilled all of its obligations stipulated under this Contract, delivery of the VESSEL shall be effected forthwith by the concurrent delivery by each of the parties hereto to the other of the PROTOCOL OF DELIVERY AND ACCEPTANCE, acknowledging delivery of the VESSEL by the BUILDER and acceptance thereof by the BUYER. The BUYER and the BUILDER agree to describe in the Protocol of Delivery and Acceptance (i) the amount of reduction in the Contract Price at delivery of the VESSEL in lieu of completion of uncompleted work and correction of defects, deficiencies, or damage by the BUILDER, and, if the amount of the proposed reduction is more than the amounts due from the BUYER at delivery, the amount to be paid by the BUILDER to the BUYER to the extent the price reduction amount is insufficient; and/or (ii) (y) the uncompleted work and defects, deficiencies, or damage to be completed and corrected by the BUILDER after delivery of the VESSEL, such completion and correction to be performed in the same manner as provided for Guarantee work under Article IX, and (z) the amount of the Contract Price to be withheld until the uncompleted work is completed and the defects, deficiencies, or damage are corrected. The BUILDER agrees to perform such completion and correction in such manner after delivery of the VESSEL. The BUYER shall pay the BUILDER for satisfactory performance of such completion and correction after delivery in the manner set forth in ARTICLE IX. If the BUYER and the BUILDER fail to agree as to any of the items to be included in the Protocol of Delivery and Acceptance pursuant to this Article, such items shall be resolved pursuant to ARTICLE XIV. c. In the event of any dispute concerning any Milestone Payment or the payment due upon delivery of the VESSEL, including the question of the BUYER s right to offset any claim it may have, the BUYER shall pay the undisputed amount to the BUILDER and shall deposit the disputed amount into escrow subject to the Escrow Instructions. The BUILDER cannot in such case refuse to deliver the VESSEL and the BUYER cannot refuse to take delivery of the VESSEL. Any such disputed amount shall be paid as agreed by the parties or as determined by Article XIV. d. During the period thirty (30) days prior to the expected delivery of the VESSEL, employees of the BUYER or the BUYERS s contractors or agents shall be entitled to access to the VESSEL to engage in such activities and perform such work as the BUYER may specify on a not-to-interfere basis.

It is agreed that if, through no fault on the part of the BUILDER, the classification and/or other certificates are not available at the time of delivery of the VESSEL, provisional certificates shall be accepted by the BUYER, provided that the BUILDER shall furnish the BUYER with the formal certificates as promptly as possible after such formal certificates have been issued. e. DECLARATION OF WARRANTY of the BUILDER that the VESSEL is delivered to the BUYER free and clear of any liens, charges, claims, mortgages, or other encumbrances upon the BUYER s title thereto, and in particular, that the VESSEL is absolutely free of all burdens in the nature of imposts, taxes or charges imposed by local or federal authorities, as well as of all liabilities of the BUILDER to its subcontractors, employees and crew, and of all liabilities arising from the operation of the VESSEL in trial runs, or otherwise, prior to delivery. f.

COMMERCIAL INVOICE and BILL OF SALE. The BUILDER will cooperate with the BUYER to provide any other documents reasonably required by the BUYER to secure financing for the VESSEL. 4. Tender of the VESSEL: If the BUYER fails to take delivery of the VESSEL after completion thereof according to this Contract without any justifiable reason, the BUILDER shall have the right to tender 
 21 

delivery of the VESSEL after compliance with all procedural requirements as above provided. 5.

The BUILDER warrants that the BUILDER s entering into this Contract, the performance of the BUILDER S obligations hereunder and the sale of the VESSEL to BUYER will not result in any violation of or be in conflict with, or result in a breach of or constitute a default under, any term or provision of any agreement, instrument or other restriction to which the BUILDER is a party or by which it is bound. 6. Removal of the VESSEL: The BUYER shall take possession of the VESSEL immediately upon delivery and acceptance thereof and shall remove the VESSEL from the premises of the Shipyard within ten (10) days after delivery and acceptance thereof is completed. If the BUYER shall not remove the VESSEL from the premises of the Shipyard within the aforesaid ten (10) days, then, in such event the BUYER shall pay to the BUILDER the mooring charges of the VESSEL at the rate of [ ] per day plus utilities. Such additional time on the BUILDER s premises shall not exceed twenty-one (21) days. ARTICLE VIII -- EXTENSION OF TIME FOR DELIVERY DUE TO FORCE MAJEURE AND TERMINATION FOR EXCESSIVE DELAY 1. Causes of Force Majeure: Force Majeure (herein called Force Majeure is any or more of the events defined below: Acts of God; acts of princes or rulers; requirements of government authorities; delays caused by regulatory bodies whose documents or approvals are required; war or other hostilities or preparations thereto; blockade; revolution; insurrections; mobilizations; civil war; civil commotion; riots; strikes and other labor disturbances including local strikes affecting the BUILDER (not including any strikes or industrial disturbances resulting from unilateral changes made by the BUILDER under existing labor contracts); sabotages; acts of terrorists; lockouts; labor shortages, provided the BUILDER has exercised diligence in the recruitment and training of labor; plague; epidemics; pandemics; fire; flood; typhoons, hurricanes, storms or other weather conditions (other than ordinary storms or ordinary inclement weather conditions); earthquakes; tidal waves; landslides; explosions; collisions; strandings; embargoes; delays in transportation; import restrictions; shortage of materials, equipment or machinery or delay in delivery or inability to take delivery thereof, provided that such materials, equipment or machinery at the time of ordering could reasonably be expected by the BUILDER to be delivered in time, the BUILDER S choice of a vendor or 
 22 

subcontractor was reasonable and the BUILDER has exercised due diligence to monitor the actions and to expedite delivery of the vendor or to obtain substitute performance; prolonged failure or restriction of electric current or petroleum; non-delivery or late delivery of BUYER S Supplies to BUILDER S custody or other delay caused by any default or omission on the part of the BUYER in carrying out any of its obligations under this Contract; or destruction of or damage to the worksite or other works of the BUILDER, its main subcontractors or to the VESSEL or any part thereof, by any causes heretofore described in this Paragraph and any other causes properly to be considered to be beyond the BUILDER s reasonable control; provided that there shall be excluded any such causes that are in existence as of the date of execution of this Contract or as to a cause impacting a contractor or subcontractor, a cause known to the party as of the date of execution of the contract or subcontract. The Parties acknowledge the current world events surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine military conflict and agree that any future act, event, or circumstance caused by or arising from the COVID-19 pandemic or Russia-Ukraine military conflict otherwise meeting the definition of an event of Force Majeure is not excepted from that definition because of the duration and nature of the pandemic or the military conflict. Any delay in the delivery of the VESSEL caused by an event of Force Majeure as to which the provisions of this Article VIII have been satisfied shall operate to postpone the Delivery Date by the number of days of delay involved. 2. Notice of Delay: Within ten (10) days from the date of commencement of the delay on account of Permissible Delays as defined in Paragraph 3 of this Article below, the BUILDER shall advise the BUYER in writing of the date such delay commences and the reasons therefor along with BUILDER s proposed recovery plan. BUILDER shall exercise its commercially reasonable best efforts to develop a recovery plan that addresses the condition causing the delay and minimizes the length of the delay. Failure of the BUILDER to provide notification of any claim for postponement of the Delivery Date within such ten (10) days shall be deemed to be a waiver by the BUILDER of its right to propose such postponement. Likewise within ten (10) days after such delay ends, the BUILDER shall advise the BUYER in writing of the date such delay ended, and also shall specify the period of time by which the BUILDER asserts that the Delivery Date is postponed by reason of such delay. Within ten (10) days after receipt of such notification, BUYER shall inform BUILDER that BUYER either (1) accepts the new Delivery Date contained in such notification, or (2) disputes BUILDER s postponement of the Delivery Date, which dispute will be resolved under the provisions of Article XIV. Failure of the BUYER to inform the BUILDER that it either accepts the new Delivery Date or disputes the postponement of the Delivery Date within ten (10) days after receipt of BUILDER s notification shall be deemed to be a waiver by the BUYER of its right to object to such postponement. 
 23 

3. Permissible Delay: Delays on account of such causes as specified in Paragraph 1 of this Article shall be understood to be Permissible Delays provided that the BUILDER provides the notices set forth in Paragraph 2 of this Article. 4. Right to Terminate for Excessive Delay due to Force Majeure: If the total accumulated time of all delays on account of the causes specified in Paragraph 1 of this Article only (excluding all other types of delays which, under the terms of this Contract, permit postponement of the Delivery Date), amounts to [ ] months or more, then, in such event, the BUYER may terminate this Contract in accordance with the provisions of Article X hereof. The BUILDER may, at any time after the accumulated time of the aforementioned delays justifying termination by the BUYER, demand in writing that the BUYER shall make an election, in which case the BUYER shall, within twenty (20) days after such demand is received by the BUYER, notify the BUILDER in writing of either (1) its intention to terminate this Contract, or (2) consent to a postponement of the Delivery Date to a specific future date. If any further delay occurs beyond such specific future date on account of causes specified in Paragraph 1 of this Article only (and excluding all other types of delays as described above), that amounts to one (1) month or more, the BUYER shall have the same right of termination upon the same terms as hereinabove provided (except that this original six month period is reduced to one month for the further delay described in this sentence). ARTICLE IX-WARRANTY OF QUALITY 1. Guarantees at Delivery: a. The BUILDER guarantees that at the time of delivery the VESSEL will: (i) comply with applicable laws, lawful regulations, written standards and written interpretations of the regulatory bodies required for the VESSEL s operation in the foreign and domestic trades of the United States in effect on the date of delivery of the VESSEL, except as noted in the PROTOCOL OF DELIVERY AND ACCEPTANCE; and (ii) meet the requirements in the Specification and plans, except as noted in the PROTOCOL OF DELIVERY AND ACCEPTANCE. The effect of any changes in laws, lawful regulations, standards and written interpretations of the regulatory bodies between the effective date of this Contract and the delivery of the VESSEL shall be incorporated into this Contract by a Change Order under ARTICLE V. b. The expense of all changes to the VESSEL noted in the PROTOCOL OF DELIVERY AND ACCEPTANCE shall be for the account of the BUILDER, except as provided in subparagraph (a) of ARTICLE V, Paragraph 2. 2. Warranty: a . Subject to the provisions hereinafter set forth, the BUILDER undertakes to remedy, free of charge to the BUYER, any deficiency, defects, failure, breaking down or deterioration beyond that caused by ordinary wear and tear (jointly 
 24 

defects in the VESSEL which are due to defective material, faulty design and/or bad workmanship on the part of the BUILDER and/or its contractors or subcontractors, provided that the defects are discovered within a period of twelve (12) months after the date of delivery of the VESSEL (the Guarantee Period and a notice thereof is duly given to the BUILDER as hereinbelow provided. In computing the Guarantee Period there shall be excluded any time the VESSEL is prevented from entering or is taken out of service on account of any defect for which the BUILDER is responsible. For the purpose of this Article, the VESSEL shall include her hull, machinery, equipment and gear, but excludes any parts of the VESSEL that have been supplied by or on behalf of the BUYER. Upon expiration of the Guarantee Period, and to the extent permitted by vendors and subcontractors, the BUILDER agrees to transfer any guarantees or warranties supplied to it by vendors and subcontractors. b. The BUILDER s guarantee of the coatings shall be back to back with the guarantee of the coatings by the coatings manufacturer. During the Guarantee Period, the BUILDER shall be responsible for correction of paint defects in accordance with the guarantee of the coatings by the coatings manufacturer. After the expiration of the VESSEL Guarantee Period, the coating manufacturer s extended warranty shall be transferred to the BUYER under Article IX subparagraph 5d. The coating manufacturer s warranty shall be for at least sixty (60) months from delivery of the VESSEL. 3. Notice of Defects: The BUYER shall notify the BUILDER in writing of any defects for which claim is made under this guarantee as promptly as possible after discovery thereof. If the defect was discovered during drydocking of the VESSEL, the BUYER must notify the BUILDER in time for the BUILDER to inspect the defect before the VESSEL leaves the drydock if this is necessary for a prudent inspection of the defect. The BUYER s written notice shall in sufficient detail describe the nature and extent of the defects. The BUILDER shall have no obligation for any defects discovered prior to the expiry date of the said twelve (12) months period, unless notice of such defects is received by the BUILDER not later than thirty (30) days after such expiry date. 4. Remedy of Defects: a. The BUILDER shall promptly remedy, at its expense, any defects, against which the VESSEL is guaranteed under this Article, by making all necessary repairs or replacements at the Shipyard, if practicable. Upon having remedied such defects the BUILDER shall give the BUYER a further guarantee period of six (6) months for the aforementioned repairs or replacements from the date such repair or replacement is accomplished, which extended period shall not reduce the original twelve (12) month Guarantee Period. b. However, if it is impractical to bring the VESSEL to the Shipyard, or if the BUILDER is unable to remedy the defects within a period of time satisfactory to the BUYER due to the BUILDER S or the VESSEL s working schedule or any other reason, the 
 25 

BUYER may cause the necessary repairs or replacements to be made elsewhere which is deemed suitable for the purpose, provided that, in such event, the BUILDER may forward or supply replacement parts or materials to the VESSEL, unless forwarding or supplying thereof to the VESSEL would impair or delay the operation or working schedule of the VESSEL. In the event that the BUYER proposes to cause the necessary repairs or replacements to be made to the VESSEL at any other shipyard or works than the Shipyard, the BUYER shall first, but in all events as soon as possible, give the BUILDER notice in writing of the time and place such repairs or replacements will be made, and if the VESSEL is not thereby delayed, or her operation or working schedule is not thereby impaired, the BUILDER shall have the right to verify by its own representative(s) the nature and extent of the defects complained of. The BUILDER shall, in such case, promptly advise the BUYER in writing, after such examination has been completed, of its acceptance or rejection of the defects as ones that are covered by the guarantee herein provided. Upon the BUILDER s acceptance of the defects as justifying remedy under this Article, or upon resolution of a dispute in accordance with the provisions of Article XIV hereof, the BUILDER shall immediately pay to the BUYER for such repairs or replacements the sum of BUYER S documented costs therefor up to a sum equal to the reasonable cost of making the same repairs or replacements in the Shipyard. Subject to a written agreement with the BUILDER, warranty repairs may be made by the crewmembers of the VESSEL, provided however that the BUYER submits documentation for the work performed and the BUILDER will not reimburse the BUYER at labor rates currently in excess of 68.00 per hour (as escalated at 2.5 per year after delivery). For the avoidance of doubt, if the BUILDER is unable to remedy the defects within a period of time satisfactory to BUYER due to the BUILDER S or the VESSEL s working schedule or any other reason, BUYER shall not be obligated to operate the VESSEL with a defect even if the Classification Society agrees that the Vessel may be operated with a condition of class, and the BUYER shall be entitled to cause the necessary repairs or replacements to be made as provided in this paragraph. c. In any case, the VESSEL shall be taken at the BUYER s cost, risk and responsibility to the place elected, ready in all respects for such repairs or replacements. Any preparation, draining of pipes, cleaning of spaces to make them accessible for warranty repairs, marine chemist s certificates, including gas free certificate shall be at the BUILDER s cost. d. If a defect cannot reasonably be corrected except by drydocking the VESSEL, the BUYER shall be entitled to postpone correction and repair until a subsequent drydocking of the VESSEL. The BUYER may withhold the estimated cost of correction and repair from the Guarantee Payment until such drydocking. e. Any dispute under this Article shall be referred to dispute resolution in accordance with the provisions of Article XIV hereof. 5. Extent of the BUILDER s Responsibility: a. The BUILDER shall have no responsibility or liability for any other defects whatsoever in the VESSEL than the defects specified in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of this 
 26 

Article. Nor shall the BUILDER in any circumstances be responsible or liable for any consequential or special losses, damages or expenses including, but not limited to, loss of time, loss or breach of charters or other contractual commitments, loss of profit or earning or demurrage directly or indirectly occasioned to the BUYER by reason of the defects specified in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article or due to repairs, replacements or other works done to the VESSEL to remedy such defects; except that in the event a defect in an item of equipment or machinery causes any damage to such item of equipment or machinery or to other immediately adjacent equipment, machinery, components or portions of the VESSEL, the BUILDER shall be liable for not only the cost of correcting or repairing the defect but also for the cost of correcting or repairing such damage to such item of equipment or machinery and to such other immediately adjacent equipment, machinery, components or portions of the VESSEL caused by such defect. b. The BUILDER shall not be responsible for any defects in any part of the VESSEL which may subsequent to delivery of the VESSEL have been replaced or in any way repaired by any other contractor, or for any defects which have been caused or aggravated by omission or improper use and maintenance of the VESSEL on the part of the BUYER, its servants or agents or by ordinary wear and tear or by any other circumstances whatsoever beyond the control of the BUILDER. c. A final guaranty survey of the VESSEL shall be conducted by the BUYER at or near the expiration of the Guarantee Period. Such survey shall be based on the defects in the contract work appearing or discovered during the Guarantee Period. In the event that the VESSEL is not available for the guarantee survey on or before the end of the Guarantee Period, the BUYER promptly shall submit to the BUILDER a list of all of the defects in the contract work appearing or discovered during the Guarantee Period and all damage for which the BUILDER is liable under the provisions of this Article IX. The final guarantee survey shall be held at such port in the United States as the BUYER designates and seven (7) days written notice of time and place for such guarantee survey shall be given to the BUILDER by the BUYER. The BUILDER shall have the right to attend the guarantee survey. d. At the end of the Guarantee Period, the BUILDER agrees to transfer and assign to the BUYER, as to any item of material installed in the VESSEL, the guarantee rights of the BUILDER against the vendor of such item of material where under the terms of such vendor s guarantee the vendor s obligations extend for a period beyond the Guarantee Period; provided that the BUILDER may exclude from such assignment any rights against the vendor in favor of the BUILDER for guarantee deficiencies and damages within the Guarantee Period. The BUILDER shall advise the BUYER of the terms of any such guarantees that are assigned to the BUYER. e. The guarantee contained as hereinabove in this Article replaces and excludes any other liability, guarantee, warranty and/or condition imposed or implied by the law, customary, statutory or otherwise, by reason of the construction and sale of the VESSEL for and to the BUYER. THE BUILDER MAKES NO FURTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY 
 27 

OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS OF THE VESSEL, ITS MACHINERY OR EQUIPMENT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. f. The BUYER may withhold the Guarantee Payment and deposit the full amount into an escrow account as provided in Article II. The BUYER shall pay to the BUILDER the entire Guarantee Payment, less any amount to cover any outstanding defect, upon completion of the Guarantee Period for the VESSEL. Any amounts withheld beyond the end of the Guarantee Period pursuant this Article IX shall be paid upon the correction of each defect for which such amounts were withheld. Any dispute with respect to the amounts due under this Paragraph shall be settled pursuant to Article XIV. 6. Guarantee Engineer: The BUILDER shall have the right (at its cost) to appoint a guarantee engineer to serve on the VESSEL as its representative for such portion of the guarantee period as the BUILDER may decide. The guarantee engineer shall be a properly documented citizen of the United States. The BUYER and its employees shall give the guarantee engineer full cooperation in carrying out his duties as the representative of the BUILDER on board the VESSEL. The BUYER shall accord the guarantee engineer the treatment comparable to the VESSEL s chief engineer and shall provide him with accommodations and subsistence at no cost of the BUILDER and/or the guarantee engineer. Pertaining to the detailed particulars of this Paragraph, an agreement will be made according to this effect between the parties hereto upon delivery of the VESSEL. The guarantee engineer shall, at all times and in all respects, be deemed to be an employee of the BUILDER. The BUYER shall be under no liability whatsoever to the BUILDER or the guarantee engineer for personal injuries, including death, suffered by the guarantee engineer during the time when he is on board the VESSEL, unless such injury or death, is shown to have been caused by the gross negligence or willful acts of the BUYER, and/or its subcontractors and/or their employees or agents (including Buyer s Representative), while acting within the scope of their employment or engagement. Nor shall the BUYER be under any other liability whatsoever to the guarantee engineer.

There shall be no cost for the BUILDER S provision of an estimate regardless whether a proposed change is implemented. All such agreed changes shall be described on a change order in the form set forth in Exhibit 6 signed by the authorized representatives of the parties hereto manifesting agreements of the parties as to the work to be provided or deleted, and the effect on the Contract Price and the Delivery Date, which shall constitute amendments to this Contract and/or the Specification (each such change, a Change Order ). The BUILDER may make minor changes to the Specification, if found necessary to suit the BUILDER s local facilities; the availability of materials; introduction of improved production methods or otherwise, provided that the BUILDER shall obtain the BUYER s prior written approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. 2. Changes Based on Class Requirements, etc.: In the event that, after the date of this Contract, any requirements as to class, or as to rules and regulations to which the construction of the VESSEL is required to conform, are altered or changed by the Classification Society or the other regulatory bodies authorized to make such alterations or changes, the following provisions shall apply: a. If such alterations or changes are compulsory for the VESSEL, either of the parties hereto, upon receipt of such information from the Classification Society or such other regulatory bodies, shall promptly transmit the same to the other in writing, and the BUILDER shall thereupon incorporate such alterations or changes into the construction of the VESSEL. The BUILDER shall present to the BUYER the adjustment required by the BUILDER in the Contract Price, the Delivery Date and other terms and conditions of this Contract occasioned by the change.

The BUYER shall have the right to have a reasonable number (up to ten (10)) of authorized representatives, employees, inspectors and any other person reasonably designated by the BUYER present at the trial runs. The BUILDER may, after due notice as described above, conduct trial runs of the VESSEL without the presence of the Buyer s Representative or other authorized representative of the BUYER provided that the Classification Society and U.S. Coast Guard are present. In such case, the BUYER shall be obligated to accept the results of the trial runs on the basis of a certificate of the BUILDER, confirmed by the Classification Society and U.S. Coast Guard, stating the results of the runs. 2. Weather Conditions: The trial run shall be carried out under weather conditions deemed favorable enough in the judgment of the BUILDER subject to approval by the BUYER. In the event of unfavorable weather on the date specified for the trial run, the same shall take place on the first available day thereafter that the weather condition permits. It is agreed that, if during the trial run of the VESSEL, the weather should suddenly become so unfavorable that orderly conduct of the trial run can no longer be continued, the trial run shall be discontinued and postponed until the first favorable day next following, unless the BUYER shall assent in writing to acceptance of the VESSEL on the basis of the trial run already made before such discontinuance has occurred. Any delay of trial run caused by such unfavorable weather condition shall operate to postpone the Delivery Date by the period of delay involved and such delay shall be deemed 
 16 

as a Permissible Delay in the delivery of the VESSEL. Within twenty-four (24) hours from the cessation of a delay in the trial run caused by unfavorable weather, the BUILDER shall advise the BUYER in writing of the new proposed date for the trial run. 3. How Conducted: a. All expenses in connection with the trial run are to be for the account of the BUILDER and the BUILDER shall provide at its own expense the necessary crew to comply with conditions of safe navigation.

In measuring the consumed quantity, lubricating oils and greases remaining in the main engine, other machinery and their pipes, stern tube and the like, shall be excluded. The BUILDER shall arrange for the quantity of fuel oil, LNG, lubricating oils, greases and fresh water to be loaded on the VESSEL at delivery in accordance with the instructions of the BUYER, at the BUYER S cost. The BUILDER shall remove all waste and debris about the VESSEL and all sludge and oily water wastes from the VESSEL prior to delivery, at the BUILDER S cost. The BUYER shall promptly reimburse the BUILDER for the cost of all LNG bunkering operations, including, without limitation, operational procedures, cleaning, and safety measures. 4. Method of Acceptance or Rejection: a. Upon completion of the trial run, the BUILDER shall give the BUYER written notice of completion of the trial run along with copies of all sea trial test reports, including if the BUILDER considers that the results of the trial run indicate the conformity of the VESSEL to this Contract and the Specification. The BUYER shall, within three (3) days after receipt of such notice from the BUILDER, provide the BUILDER written notice of its intent to accept or reject the VESSEL on the Delivery Date. b. However, should the results of the trial run indicate that the VESSEL, or any part or equipment thereof, does not conform to the requirements of this Contract and/or the Specification, or if the BUILDER is in agreement as to non-conformity as specified in the BUYER s notice of rejection, then, the BUILDER shall with the written concurrence of the BUYER take the necessary steps to correct such non-conformity. Upon completion of correction and testing of such non-conformity, the BUILDER shall give the BUYER written notice thereof. The BUYER shall, within two (2) days after receipt of such notice from the BUILDER, notify the 
 17 

BUILDER of its acceptance or rejection of the VESSEL. The BUYER may only demand a new trial run if this is the only way the BUILDER can prove that the nonconformities have been corrected. In the event a new trial run takes place, the provisions set forth in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 hereof shall govern this trial run except that the BUILDER shall be entitled to give a written notice of two (2) days for such new trial run. Upon completion of the additional trial run, the provisions of this Paragraph 4 shall apply. c. In any event that the BUYER rejects the VESSEL, the BUYER shall specify in its notice of rejection in what respect the VESSEL, or any part or equipment thereof does not conform to this Contract. d. In the event that the BUYER fails to provide the BUILDER written notice of the acceptance of or the rejection together with the reason therefor of the VESSEL within the period as provided in the above subparagraphs (a) or (b), the BUYER shall be deemed to have accepted the VESSEL. e. The BUILDER may dispute the rejection of the VESSEL by the BUYER under this Paragraph 4, in which case the matter shall be submitted for final decision in accordance with Article XIV hereof. 5. Effect of Acceptance: a. Acceptance of the VESSEL as above provided shall be final and binding and the VESSEL will be deemed to be in conformity with this Contract except as set forth in subparagraph b immediately below. The BUYER shall not refuse formal delivery of the VESSEL as hereinafter provided, if the BUILDER complies with all other procedural requirements for delivery as provided in Article VII hereof. b. If minor work or items on the VESSEL are incomplete or missing when the VESSEL otherwise is ready for delivery and such work or items do not materially affect the operation, trade or schedule of the VESSEL nor are likely to cause damage or excessive deterioration to the VESSEL or void warranty requirements, the BUYER shall not withhold its consent to accept delivery of the VESSEL subject to the right of the BUYER to have such items completed by the BUILDER in a reasonable manner and period of time. The parties shall on delivery execute a protocol of outstanding work and a schedule for completion of such work or agree as to an adjustment of the Contract Price in lieu of completion of such work. The BUILDER agrees that any such monetary payments to and repairs done by BUYER shall not void the BUILDER s or any manufacturer s warranties. ARTICLE VII DELIVERY 1. Time and Place: a. The VESSEL shall be delivered by the BUILDER to the BUYER at the Shipyard or at another location acceptable to both parties hereto. The original Delivery Date 
 18 

for the VESSEL shall be December [ ], 2027 (herein called the Original Delivery Date ). b. Delays on account of such causes which under the terms of this Contract permit the BUILDER to postpone the delivery of the VESSEL shall be understood to be Permissible Delay (herein called Permissible Delay ). c. The Original Delivery Date shall be adjusted by the total Permissible Delay and the adjusted date shall be the Delivery Date (herein called the Delivery Date ). The VESSEL shall be delivered by the BUILDER to the BUYER on or before the Delivery Date. d. The BUILDER advises that it has contracts committing the BUILDER to construct five training ships and up to two subsea rock installation vessels (the other contracts ). The BUILDER advises that the Original Delivery Date is being committed to taking into account BUILDER s obligations under the other contracts. The BUILDER agrees that its obligations under the other contracts and any delay in its deliveries under the other contracts would not constitute a Permissible Delay as defined in subparagraph b. of this Paragraph 1, or a Force Majeure event under Article VIII of this Contract, unless the conditions under Article VIII apply to or otherwise impact the facilities or workforce at the Shipyard available for the construction of the VESSEL under this Contract. 2.

When the work on the VESSEL is complete or substantially complete in accordance with this Contract and the VESSEL has passed the tests required by this Contract, the VESSEL as completed or substantially completed shall be delivered by the BUILDER and accepted by the BUYER alongside a safe and accessible pier at the Shipyard, or at such other place as may be mutually agreed to by the BUILDER and the BUYER, where there must be sufficient water for the VESSEL always to be afloat and during egress from the berth, custom to the contrary notwithstanding, free and clear of all liens, security interests, and claims of every nature, excepting, however those in favor of a claimant, other than BUILDER, arising out of the acts or omissions of the BUYER, with not less than ten (10) days prior written notice to the BUYER of such delivery. As used in this Contract, the term substantially complete shall mean complete except for minor items not affecting the commercial utility and safe operation of the VESSEL, with all certificates required for operation of the VESSEL, and not violating any requirement of a regulatory body. Unless waived by the BUYER, the VESSEL shall not be deemed to be substantially complete if a delivery deficiency will require the VESSEL to be taken out of service prior to the VESSEL S regular maintenance schedule or if the aggregate value of such delivery deficiencies is in excess of [ ]. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Classification Society issues a 
 19 

Certificate of Class with a condition of class, the BUYER shall not be obligated to accept the VESSEL with such condition of class. b. Provided that the BUYER shall have fulfilled all of its obligations stipulated under this Contract, delivery of the VESSEL shall be effected forthwith by the concurrent delivery by each of the parties hereto to the other of the PROTOCOL OF DELIVERY AND ACCEPTANCE, acknowledging delivery of the VESSEL by the BUILDER and acceptance thereof by the BUYER. The BUYER and the BUILDER agree to describe in the Protocol of Delivery and Acceptance (i) the amount of reduction in the Contract Price at delivery of the VESSEL in lieu of completion of uncompleted work and correction of defects, deficiencies, or damage by the BUILDER, and, if the amount of the proposed reduction is more than the amounts due from the BUYER at delivery, the amount to be paid by the BUILDER to the BUYER to the extent the price reduction amount is insufficient; and/or (ii) (y) the uncompleted work and defects, deficiencies, or damage to be completed and corrected by the BUILDER after delivery of the VESSEL, such completion and correction to be performed in the same manner as provided for Guarantee work under Article IX, and (z) the amount of the Contract Price to be withheld until the uncompleted work is completed and the defects, deficiencies, or damage are corrected. The BUILDER agrees to perform such completion and correction in such manner after delivery of the VESSEL. The BUYER shall pay the BUILDER for satisfactory performance of such completion and correction after delivery in the manner set forth in ARTICLE IX.

The BUILDER cannot in such case refuse to deliver the VESSEL and the BUYER cannot refuse to take delivery of the VESSEL. Any such disputed amount shall be paid as agreed by the parties or as determined by Article XIV. d. During the period thirty (30) days prior to the expected delivery of the VESSEL, employees of the BUYER or the BUYERS s contractors or agents shall be entitled to access to the VESSEL to engage in such activities and perform such work as the BUYER may specify on a not-to-interfere basis.

 24 

defects in the VESSEL which are due to defective material, faulty design and/or bad workmanship on the part of the BUILDER and/or its contractors or subcontractors, provided that the defects are discovered within a period of twelve (12) months after the date of delivery of the VESSEL (the Guarantee Period and a notice thereof is duly given to the BUILDER as hereinbelow provided. In computing the Guarantee Period there shall be excluded any time the VESSEL is prevented from entering or is taken out of service on account of any defect for which the BUILDER is responsible. For the purpose of this Article, the VESSEL shall include her hull, machinery, equipment and gear, but excludes any parts of the VESSEL that have been supplied by or on behalf of the BUYER. Upon expiration of the Guarantee Period, and to the extent permitted by vendors and subcontractors, the BUILDER agrees to transfer any guarantees or warranties supplied to it by vendors and subcontractors. b. The BUILDER s guarantee of the coatings shall be back to back with the guarantee of the coatings by the coatings manufacturer.

Upon having remedied such defects the BUILDER shall give the BUYER a further guarantee period of six (6) months for the aforementioned repairs or replacements from the date such repair or replacement is accomplished, which extended period shall not reduce the original twelve (12) month Guarantee Period. b. However, if it is impractical to bring the VESSEL to the Shipyard, or if the BUILDER is unable to remedy the defects within a period of time satisfactory to the BUYER due to the BUILDER S or the VESSEL s working schedule or any other reason, the 
 25 

BUYER may cause the necessary repairs or replacements to be made elsewhere which is deemed suitable for the purpose, provided that, in such event, the BUILDER may forward or supply replacement parts or materials to the VESSEL, unless forwarding or supplying thereof to the VESSEL would impair or delay the operation or working schedule of the VESSEL.

For the avoidance of doubt, if the BUILDER is unable to remedy the defects within a period of time satisfactory to BUYER due to the BUILDER S or the VESSEL s working schedule or any other reason, BUYER shall not be obligated to operate the VESSEL with a defect even if the Classification Society agrees that the Vessel may be operated with a condition of class, and the BUYER shall be entitled to cause the necessary repairs or replacements to be made as provided in this paragraph. c. In any case, the VESSEL shall be taken at the BUYER s cost, risk and responsibility to the place elected, ready in all respects for such repairs or replacements. Any preparation, draining of pipes, cleaning of spaces to make them accessible for warranty repairs, marine chemist s certificates, including gas free certificate shall be at the BUILDER s cost. d. If a defect cannot reasonably be corrected except by drydocking the VESSEL, the BUYER shall be entitled to postpone correction and repair until a subsequent drydocking of the VESSEL.

The BUILDER shall not be responsible for any defects in any part of the VESSEL which may subsequent to delivery of the VESSEL have been replaced or in any way repaired by any other contractor, or for any defects which have been caused or aggravated by omission or improper use and maintenance of the VESSEL on the part of the BUYER, its servants or agents or by ordinary wear and tear or by any other circumstances whatsoever beyond the control of the BUILDER. c. A final guaranty survey of the VESSEL shall be conducted by the BUYER at or near the expiration of the Guarantee Period.

The BUILDER shall advise the BUYER of the terms of any such guarantees that are assigned to the BUYER. e. The guarantee contained as hereinabove in this Article replaces and excludes any other liability, guarantee, warranty and/or condition imposed or implied by the law, customary, statutory or otherwise, by reason of the construction and sale of the VESSEL for and to the BUYER. THE BUILDER MAKES NO FURTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY

At this time it is anticipated that this cooperation will entail the following: a. providing information of any nature with respect to the VESSEL, its construction, and the BUILDER (including confidential information) in the possession of the BUILDER or its suppliers and not otherwise readily available to the BUYER that is reasonably requested by (i) MARAD as a condition to processing or approving any application for Title XI financing submitted by the BUYER, including Forms MA-163, MA-440 and MA-133, and (ii) the lenders under a non-Title XI financing; and in all cases as soon as reasonably practicable after it is requested; b. (i) making any amendments to this Contract and the Guaranty that are reasonably requested by MARAD as a condition to processing or approving any application for Title XI financing submitted by the BUYER or any affiliate of the BUYER, or that are reasonably requested by any non-Title XI lenders, provided such amendments are customarily requested by MARAD or such non-Title XI lenders in connection with other financings and do not unreasonably increase the obligations or decrease the rights of the BUILDER or the GUARANTOR, it being understood that such amendments may include, without limitation, documentation in support of invoices, audit, inspection, and consent rights, copies of drawings, notices, insurance coverages and loss payable clauses, naming MARAD or such lenders as beneficiary of the Guaranty or any other security provided in respect of BUILDER s performance under this Contract, any amendments or supplements relating to the assignment of, or the granting of security interest in, this Contract to MARAD or any other Lender Party as security for the Title XI financing or any private or bank financing, allowing the Lender Parties to have reasonable access to the Shipyard to inspect the work in process on the VESSEL, certifying substantial completion of the VESSEL at delivery, and attending any tests and sea trials; and (ii) providing documentation evidencing (x) its consent to any assignment of, or the granting of security interest in, this Contract, the VESSEL or any work in process with respect to the VESSEL as security for the Title XI financing or any private or bank financing or otherwise in connection therewith, including without limitation any Permitted Financing Assignment, in each case in form and substance reasonably requested by MARAD or any other applicable Lender Party; and (y) its consent to subordination of its interests herein and with respect to the VESSEL and any work in process with respect to the VESSEL to any such lien or security interest of the Lender Parties to the extent of the aggregate of the initial payments and all milestone payments made by BUYER from time to time, in each case in form and substance reasonably requested by MARAD or any other applicable Lender Party; c. identifying and tracking from the time the BUILDER places orders for the same, the foreign components and services that will be utilized in the construction of the 
 49 

VESSEL and providing all information requested by MARAD in the possession of the BUILDER or its suppliers and not otherwise readily available to the BUYER that is (i) to support a waiver to include in Actual Cost the cost of any foreign components (including information that substantiates the choice of foreign over domestic), and (ii) to support the BUYER in complying with MARAD s cargo preference requirements and policies regarding the transport of such foreign components to the U.S. by ocean on U.S.-flag vessels in order to satisfy MARAD s foreign components waiver requirements, and providing such information as soon as reasonably practicable after it is requested; d. supporting the BUYER s efforts to secure any grants or awards that might be available related to the LNG features or TIER 3 engines on the VESSEL; and e. applying for and providing the BUYER a U.S. Coast Guard ruling confirming the U.S. construction of the VESSEL to enable the BUYER to treat the VESSEL as a qualified vessel under the BUYER s CCF for purposes of 46 USC Chapter 535 53501(2)(B) and 46 C.F.R. 390.5. All of the foregoing the BUILDER shall perform with no changes to the Delivery Date and with no costs to the BUYER other than such actual out-of-pocket costs paid by the BUILDER to third parties which the BUYER shall have previously approved in writing. For clarity, (1) the BUILDER shall not be required to incur any out-of-pocket costs if the BUYER refuses to approve and reimburse those costs, and (2) the BUILDER will not pay any increased costs of carriage in connection with the BUYER s compliance with MARAD s cargo preference requirements and policies.

It is the intention of the parties hereto that the indemnity provisions herein pertaining to employees of the BUILDER shall be effective despite the provisions of 33 U.S.C. 905(b) as and to the extent that in any claim or action liability is alleged to be that of the BUILDER, its agents, employees, or subcontractors, it being agreed that for purposes of said section the VESSEL being constructed shall not become a vessel until such time as the VESSEL is officially documented by the United States Coast Guard and the Classification Society and becomes a vessel capable of being legally used for transportation of goods on water. The BUILDER s indemnity set forth hereinabove shall not apply to any injury or death of any person or to any damage to or loss of property of third parties occurring in connection with the VESSEL after the delivery and acceptance of the VESSEL by the BUYER, provided that this exclusion shall not apply to claims for injury or death of any person, or to any damage to or loss of property of third parties occurring prior to delivery but for which a claim is not instituted until after delivery and acceptance of the VESSEL by the BUYER. 3.
