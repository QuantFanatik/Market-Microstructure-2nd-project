 (vi) litigation, arbitration or regulatory investigations, including as a result of the appointment of a representative on behalf of certain Beneficiaries.

Part I 
 
 Item 1. Business 
 Overview 
 The Trust was established under the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Metropolitan Life plan of reorganization (the Plan and pursuant to the MetLife Policyholder Trust Agreement, dated as of November 3, 1999, by and among Metropolitan Life, MetLife, Inc., Wilmington Trust Company (not in its individual capacity, but solely as trustee for the Trust, the Trustee and ChaseMellon Shareholder Services, L.L.C., as custodian (now known as Computershare Inc., the Custodian ), as amended on November 8, 2001 (the Trust Agreement ), in connection with the conversion of Metropolitan Life from a mutual life insurance company to a stock life insurance company. The Trust is a single-purpose trust that does not engage in any business or activity other than voting and holding the Trust Shares and certain closely related activities, such as distributing cash dividends and other distributions. The Trust has no employees. See Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for financial information about the Trust. 
 Under the Plan and the Trust Agreement, each policyholder s membership interest was extinguished and certain eligible policyholders of Metropolitan Life (the Trust Eligible Policyholders received, in exchange for that interest, a number of interests in the Trust Trust Interests equal to the number of shares of common stock of MetLife, Inc., par value 0.01 per share (the Common Stock ), allocated to them in accordance with the Plan. The assets of the Trust consist principally of the shares of Common Stock issued to the Trust (the Trust Shares for the benefit of the Trust Eligible Policyholders and permitted transferees (collectively, the Beneficiaries ). The Trust Shares are held in the name of the Trustee, on behalf of the Trust, which has legal title over the Trust Shares. The Beneficiaries do not have legal title to any part of the assets of the Trust. The Trust Interests represent undivided fractional interests in the Trust Shares and other assets of the Trust beneficially owned by a Trust Beneficiary through the Custodian. On April 7, 2000, the date of demutualization of Metropolitan Life, MetLife, Inc. distributed to the Trust 494,466,664 shares of Common Stock for the benefit of policyholders of Metropolitan Life. Beneficiaries may withdraw all, but generally not less than all, of their allocated shares of Common Stock from the Trust at any time by providing written notice to the Custodian. 
 Withdrawals by Beneficiaries of Trust Shares, transactions by Beneficiaries under the Purchase and Sale Program (as defined below), and escheatment of unclaimed Trust Shares resulted in a net decrease in the number of Trust Shares from 129,271,548 at December 31, 2021 to 123,606,156 at December 31, 2022. 
 A Trust Interest entitles the Beneficiary to certain rights, including the right to: (i) receive dividends distributed upon Trust Shares; (ii) have Trust Shares withdrawn from the Trust to be sold for cash through a purchase and sale program established by MetLife, Inc. pursuant to the Plan (the Purchase and Sale Program (iii) deposit in the Trust additional shares of Common Stock purchased through the Purchase and Sale Program; (iv) withdraw Trust Shares; and (v) instruct the Trustee to vote the Trust Shares on certain matters, each as further described in and limited by the terms of the Trust Agreement. The Trustee has no beneficial interest in the Trust Shares. 
 As a general rule, Beneficiaries are prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, encumbering or granting any option or any other interest in their Trust Interests; however, Trust Interests may be transferred in certain limited circumstances. See Risk Factors There is no existing trading market for the Trust Interests and Beneficiaries may transfer their Trust Interests only in limited circumstances. 
 In addition, if the Board of Directors of MetLife, Inc. determines, based on the advice of legal counsel, that there is, at any time, a material risk that the assets of the Trust may be characterized as plan assets under United States Department of Labor Reg. 2510.3-101, as amended, the Board may direct the Trustee to distribute to the Custodian, for distribution to one or more Beneficiaries, a number of Trust Shares (not to exceed the total number of such Beneficiaries Trust Interests) as the Board may determine to be necessary or appropriate to ensure that the assets of the Trust will not be so characterized as plan assets. 
 A transferee of Trust Interests will become subject to the Trust Agreement. Trust Interests are held in the name of the Custodian, which keeps a record of the Trust Interests of the Beneficiaries on a book-entry system maintained by the Custodian. The Trust Interests are not represented by certificates or other evidences of ownership.

Beneficiary Voting Rights 
 See Note 4 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for information regarding the manner in which the Trustee may vote, assent or consent the Trust Shares at all times during the term of the Trust (i) on all matters brought for a vote before the stockholders of MetLife, Inc., and (ii) on all Beneficiary Consent Matters (as defined below). 
 A Beneficiary Consent Matter is a matter presented to stockholders of MetLife, Inc. concerning the following: 
 (i) subject to certain conditions, a contested election of directors or the removal of a director; 
 (ii) a merger or consolidation, a sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the property or assets or a recapitalization or dissolution of MetLife, Inc., if it requires a vote of stockholders under applicable Delaware law; 
 (iii) any transaction that would result in an exchange or conversion of Trust Shares for cash, securities or other property; and 
 (iv) proposals submitted to stockholders requiring the Board of Directors to amend MetLife, Inc. s stockholder rights plan, or redeem rights under that plan, other than a proposal with respect to which MetLife, Inc. has received advice of nationally-recognized legal counsel to the effect that the proposal is not a proper subject for stockholder action under Delaware law. MetLife, Inc. does not currently have a stockholder rights plan. 
 Proxy solicitation materials, annual reports and information statements received by the Custodian in connection with any matter not involving a Beneficiary Consent Matter will be made available by MetLife, Inc. to Beneficiaries for their information on a website maintained by MetLife, Inc. or by mail upon request and at MetLife, Inc. s expense, but voting instructions to the Trustee will not be solicited and, if instructions are received, they will not be binding on the Trustee. 
 Distributions to Trust Beneficiaries 
 See Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for information regarding distributions to Beneficiaries. 
 Termination of the Trust 
 See Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for information regarding the termination of the Trust. 
 Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the Trust is eligible to be terminated at MetLife, Inc. s discretion, as the Trust Shares constitute less than 25 of the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. See Common Stock Transactions and Risk Factors The Trust is terminable at any time at the discretion of MetLife, Inc. MetLife, Inc. has not advised the Trustee of any intention to voluntarily terminate the Trust. 
 Common Stock Transactions 
 The number of Trust Shares declined to 123,606,156 at December 31, 2022 as a result of withdrawals by Beneficiaries of Trust Shares, transactions by Beneficiaries under the Purchase and Sale Program and escheatment of unclaimed Trust Shares. The percentage of outstanding shares of Common Stock owned by the Trust increased from 15.7 at December 31, 2021 to 15.9 at December 31, 2022. See Note 1 to the Financial Statements for further information regarding Common Stock issuances and repurchases. 
 In May 2022, MetLife, Inc. announced that its Board of Directors authorized 3.0 billion of Common Stock repurchases. At December 31, 2022, MetLife, Inc. had 1.2 billion of Common Stock repurchases remaining under the authorization. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

Amendments, Preemptive Rights and Expenses 
 The Trust Agreement may be amended from time to time by the Trustee, the Custodian, MetLife, Inc. and Metropolitan Life, without the consent of any Beneficiary, to: (i) cure any ambiguity, correct or supplement any provision therein that may be inconsistent with any other provision therein, or to make any other provision with respect to matters or questions arising under the Trust Agreement, which will not be inconsistent with the other provisions of the Trust Agreement, provided that the action does not adversely affect the Trust Interests of the Beneficiaries; (ii) modify, eliminate or add to any provisions of the Trust Agreement to such extent as will be necessary to ensure that the Trust will be classified for United States federal income tax purposes as a grantor trust at all times or to ensure that the Trust will not be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; or (iii) reflect the effect of a merger or consolidation in which MetLife, Inc. is not the surviving corporation and the other company into which MetLife, Inc. is merged or consolidated assumes its obligations under the Trust Agreement. The Trust Agreement may also be amended or provisions thereof waived with the consent of Beneficiaries representing more than one-half of the Trust Interests, provided that no such amendment or waiver will, without the consent of each Beneficiary affected thereby, reduce the Trust Interests or otherwise eliminate or materially postpone the right of any Beneficiary to receive dividends or other distributions or to make elections under the Purchase and Sale Program or to withdraw Trust Shares. 
 Beneficiaries will not have any preemptive rights with respect to the Trust Interests. There is no provision for any sinking fund with respect to the Trust Interests. 
 The Trust Agreement provides that MetLife, Inc. shall pay, or reimburse directly, each of the Trustee and the Custodian for all costs and expenses relating to the Trust, in the case of the Trustee, and relating to the holding of Trust Interests, in the case of the Custodian, including, but not limited to, the fees and expenses as provided in the Trust Agreement. MetLife, Inc. pays the Trustee an annual fee of 50 thousand.

 Restrictions on Payment of Common Stock Dividends to Trust Beneficiaries

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 The Trust has limited resources and is dependent upon MetLife, Inc. 
 The Trust is a single-purpose trust that does not engage in any business or activity other than voting and holding the Trust Shares and certain closely related activities, such as distributing cash dividends and other distributions. The assets of the Trust consist principally of the Trust Shares. As such, the Trust is exposed to equity market risk; any decline in the market price of Common Stock will adversely affect the value of the Trust Shares and, correspondingly, the Beneficiaries Trust Interests. Beneficiaries of the Trust are directed to MetLife, Inc. s Risk Factors set forth in Item 1A of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and the other Exchange Act filings of MetLife, Inc. for information regarding certain risks related to MetLife, Inc. that may affect the value of the Trust Shares, including regulatory and other restrictions which may affect MetLife, Inc. s ability to pay dividends on the Common Stock. See also Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Beneficiaries do not have legal title to any part of the Trust assets and have only certain limited rights. 
 The Trust has legal title over the Trust Shares. The Trust Interests represent undivided fractional interests in the Trust Shares and other assets of the Trust beneficially owned by a Trust Beneficiary through the Custodian. A Trust Interest entitles the Beneficiary only to certain rights. See Business Overview and Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. Voting instructions to the Trustee on any matter not involving a Beneficiary Consent Matter will not be solicited and, if instructions are received, they will not be binding on the Trustee. On all matters other than Beneficiary Consent Matters, the Trustee shall vote, assent or consent the Trust Shares in favor of and in opposition to such matter, or abstain from voting on such matter, in accordance with the recommendation given by the Board of Directors of MetLife, Inc. to its stockholders in respect of the matter, or, if no such recommendation is given, as directed by the Board of Directors of MetLife, Inc.

Table of Contents 

There is no existing trading market for the Trust Interests and Beneficiaries may transfer their Trust Interests only in limited circumstances. 
 There is no existing trading market for the Trust Interests and the Trust Interests have no market value. Furthermore, Trust Interests may generally be transferred only in the following situations: (i) from the estate of a deceased Beneficiary to one or more beneficiaries taking by operation of law or pursuant to testamentary succession; (ii) to the spouse or issue of a Beneficiary or to an entity selected by a Beneficiary, provided that transfers to such entity are deductible for federal income, gift and estate tax purposes under 170, 2055 and 2522 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or to a trust established for the exclusive benefit of one or more of the following: (x) Beneficiaries, (y) individuals described in this clause (ii), or (z) entities described in this clause (ii); (iii) to a trust established to hold Trust Interests on behalf of an employee benefit plan; (iv) if the Beneficiary is not a natural person, by operation of law to the surviving entity upon the merger or consolidation of such Beneficiary into another entity, to the purchaser of substantially all the assets of such Beneficiary or to the appropriate persons upon the dissolution, termination or winding up of such Beneficiary; (v) by operation of law as a consequence of the bankruptcy or insolvency of such Beneficiary or the granting of relief to such Beneficiary under the Federal bankruptcy laws; or (vi) from a trust holding an insurance policy or annuity contract on behalf of the insured person under such policy or contract, to those persons to whom Trust Interests are required to be so transferred pursuant to the terms of such trust. 
 The Trust is terminable at any time at the discretion of MetLife, Inc. 
 The Trust Agreement provides that MetLife, Inc. may terminate the Trust once the percentage of outstanding shares of Common Stock held in the Trust falls to 25 . The winding up of the Trust must commence 90 days after the date on which the Trustee receives written notice from MetLife, Inc. that the number of Trust Shares is 10 or less of the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. Withdrawals by Beneficiaries of Trust Shares, sales by Beneficiaries of Trust Shares under the Purchase and Sale Program and escheatment of unclaimed Trust Shares, as well as issuances of Common Stock by MetLife, Inc. will result in a decrease of the percentage of outstanding shares of Common Stock held in the Trust; purchases by Beneficiaries of Trust Shares under the Purchase and Sale Program, and repurchases of Common Stock by MetLife Inc. will result in an increase of such percentage. At February 14, 2023, the number of Trust Shares represented 15.9 of the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock and, thus, the Trust may be terminated at the discretion of MetLife, Inc. 
 MetLife, Inc., the Custodian, the Trustee or any of their respective vendors may fail to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data, including Beneficiary confidential information, as a result of a failure in any of their respective cybersecurity or other information security systems, or disaster recovery plans, and any such failure may also adversely affect the Trust s operations. 
 The Trust is highly dependent on the effective operation of the information systems of MetLife, Inc., the Custodian and the Trustee and their respective vendors. The operations of the Trust rely on the proper functioning of these systems, and any of these systems may suffer computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized or fraudulent access, human errors, cyberattacks or other penetrations. A failure in the security of such systems or a failure to maintain the security of such systems, or the confidential information stored thereon, may adversely affect the Trust s ability to operate and may result in regulatory enforcement action. 
 Notwithstanding compliance with regulatory and accounting requirements in relation to internal controls and the Trustee s conclusion that internal control over reporting for the Trust is effective as of the date reported, there is a risk that MetLife, Inc. s, the Custodian s, the Trustee s or any of their respective vendors internal controls will prove to be ineffective and significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the Trust s internal controls may occur in the future. 
 MetLife, Inc., the Custodian, the Trustee or any of their respective vendors may suffer disasters such as a natural catastrophe, epidemic, pandemic, industrial accident, blackout, computer virus, terrorist attack, ransomware or cyberattack, or war, and other breaches of cybersecurity and information security systems. Globally, the frequency, severity and sophistication of cybersecurity incidents have increased, and these trends may continue. While MetLife, Inc., the Custodian and the Trustee have implemented, and require their respective critical vendors to implement, what is believed to be effective cybersecurity and data protection measures, efforts to minimize the risk of cyber-incidents and protect information technology may be insufficient to prevent break-ins, attacks, fraud, security breaches or other unauthorized access to the systems of MetLife Inc., the Custodian, the Trustee and their respective vendors, including as a result of software code that contains vulnerabilities that are unknown that may increase the potential of cyber-attacks or unauthorized access. Such incidents may not be timely detected. There is no assurance that the security measures of MetLife, Inc., the Custodian, the Trustee or any of their respective vendors, including information security policies, administrative, technical and physical controls and other actions designed as preventative, will provide fully effective protection from such events.

In connection with the Trust s operations, personal, confidential and proprietary information are routinely transmitted, received and stored by electronic means. Failure to keep such information confidential and secure may result in the intentional or unintentional disclosure or misuse of confidential information, as well as others misappropriation of such confidential information which could result in significant legal and regulatory liability and expenses. 
 Information security and disaster recovery systems may be insufficient to safeguard the Trust s operations, particularly if computer-based data processing, transmission, storage and retrieval systems are affected, and confidentiality, integrity or availability of valuable data are adversely impacted. The ability of MetLife, Inc., the Custodian or the Trustee to conduct business effectively and maintain the security, integrity, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data could be severely compromised if key personnel are unavailable, or if vendors ability to provide goods and services or to perform their job responsibilities is impaired by a disaster. MetLife, Inc., the Custodian or the Trustee may not carry insurance sufficient to protect the Trust from all losses that may result from such interruptions, and any insurance for liability, operational and other risks may become less readily available or more expensive in the future. 
 Regulators or others scrutiny of cybersecurity, including new laws or regulations, could increase compliance costs and operational burdens, especially as regulatory and legislative focus on cybersecurity matters intensifies. Regulators, Trust Beneficiaries or others may act against the Trust for any cybersecurity failures. Continuous technological evaluations and enhancements, including changes designed to update protective measures, may increase the risk of a breach or gap in security measures. Any of these could adversely impact the processing of transactions, including those under the Purchase and Sale Program, as well as the confidential proprietary and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through such computer systems and networks or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in the operations of the Trust, which could expose the Trust to litigation and result in increased costs, regulatory investigations and penalties and/or Beneficiary dissatisfaction. Moreover, all of the documents and records in the information storage systems used by MetLife, Inc., the Custodian or the Trustee, whether electronic or physical, may not be reliably accessible. Compliance with laws on, or regulators scrutiny of, the use, collection, management, or transfer of data and other privacy practices could result in higher costs. 
 MetLife, Inc., the Custodian and the Trustee have an increasing challenge of attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel to combat security threats. Continuous technological evaluations and enhancements, including changes designed to update protective measures, may increase the risk of a breach or gap in security. The Trust may incur higher costs to comply with laws on, or regulators scrutiny of, the use, collection, management or transfer of data and other privacy practices. There can be no assurance that enhancements to the cybersecurity and information security systems of MetLife, Inc., the Custodian or the Trustee will be effective in preventing or limiting the impact of future cybersecurity incidents. 
 Litigation may result in adverse results or other consequences; a representative may be appointed for certain Beneficiaries in legal proceedings. 
 It is possible that claims, litigation, unasserted claims probable of assertion, investigations and proceedings may be commenced in the future, and the Trust could become subject to investigations and have lawsuits filed or enforcement actions initiated against it which could adversely affect the results of the Trust or have other consequences. 
 In any lawsuit or other legal proceeding involving the Trust Interests, a representative may be appointed to represent Beneficiaries who do not have the legal capacity to represent themselves or whose addresses are unknown. The outcome of the lawsuit or other legal proceeding will be binding on Beneficiaries for whom the representative was appointed in the lawsuit or other proceeding.

 Executive Summary 
 The Trust was established under the Plan and pursuant to the Trust Agreement, in connection with the conversion of Metropolitan Life from a mutual life insurance company to a stock life insurance company. The Trust is a single-purpose trust that does not engage in any business or activity other than voting and holding the Trust Shares and certain closely related activities, such as distributing cash dividends and other distributions. See Business Overview and Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. 
 The number of Trust Interests outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 123,606,156 and 129,271,548, respectively. The decrease of 5,665,392 in the number of Trust Interests is primarily attributable to Trust Interests redeemed, Trust Interests withdrawn and Trust Interests escheated. Net assets of the Trust consist solely of Trust Shares which will increase or decrease depending upon, among other things, the movement of Trust Shares into or out of the Trust as directed by the Beneficiaries. 
 Results of Operations 
 Discussion of Results 
 Year ended December 31, 2022 compared with the year ended December 31, 2021 
 Net assets in the Trust increased 867 million, or 11 , to 8.9 billion at December 31, 2022 from 8.1 billion at December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to an increase in net unrealized investment gains on the Trust Shares, partially offset by (i) net activity under the Purchase and Sale Program; (ii) the impact of withdrawals of Trust Shares by Beneficiaries from the Trust; and (iii) the impact of escheatment of unclaimed cash and Trust Shares. Net unrealized investment gains, which represent the difference between the estimated fair value and the cost basis of the Trust Shares, increased 938 million from the prior year. A net reduction of 5,665,392 Trust Interests resulted from (i) a net decrease of 3,615,101 Trust Interests in connection with redemptions and issuances under the Purchase and Sale Program, (ii) a decrease of 1,173,740 Trust Interests due to withdrawals of Trust Shares by Beneficiaries from the Trust, and (iii) a decrease of 876,551 Trust Interests due to escheatment of Trust Shares. The net reduction of Trust Interests as a result of activity through the Purchase and Sale Program, withdrawals of Trust Shares by Beneficiaries from the Trust and escheatment of unclaimed cash and Trust Shares decreased net assets for the year ended December 31, 2022 by 45 million, 15 million and 11 million, respectively. Net investment income of 250 million, which consisted of Common Stock dividends received from MetLife, Inc., and net realized investment gains of 199 million recognized on the sale of Trust Shares sold through the Purchase and Sale Program, were fully allocated to Beneficiaries. 
 Subsequent Events 
 Common Stock Dividends 
 On January 10, 2023, MetLife, Inc. s Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2023 Common Stock dividend of 0.50 per share payable on March 14, 2023 to shareholders of record as of February 7, 2023. The aggregate dividend payment to Beneficiaries was 62 million.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The Trust s investments are in equity securities, all of which are exposed to equity market risk. The market valuation of equity securities can fluctuate in response to political, market and economic developments and affect a single issuer, issuers within an industry, an economic sector, a geographic region, or the market as a whole. In the short-term, equity prices can fluctuate dramatically in response to these developments. Changes in other market factors, such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates, will also impact the value of the Trust s investments to the extent they impact the market value of the Trust Shares held. As the Trust s holdings in equity securities can only be comprised of Common Stock under the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trust is unable to diversify its holdings to mute price fluctuations, the effects of which inure to the Beneficiaries.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 MetLife Policyholder Trust: 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities of the MetLife Policyholder Trust (the Trust as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations and changes in net assets, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Trust as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and changes in net assets for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Trust s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Trust s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

 Under the Plan and the Trust Agreement, each policyholder s membership interest was extinguished and certain eligible policyholders of Metropolitan Life (the Trust Eligible Policyholders received, in exchange for that interest, a number of interests in the Trust Trust Interests equal to the number of shares of common stock of MetLife, Inc., par value per share (the Common Stock ), allocated to them in accordance with the Plan. The assets of the Trust consist principally of the shares of Common Stock issued to the Trust (the Trust Shares for the benefit of the Trust Eligible Policyholders and permitted transferees (collectively, the Beneficiaries ). The Trust Shares are held in the name of the Trustee, on behalf of the Trust, which has legal title over the Trust Shares. The Beneficiaries do not have legal title to any part of the assets of the Trust. The Trust Interests represent undivided fractional interests in the Trust Shares and other assets of the Trust beneficially owned by a Trust Beneficiary through the Custodian. On April 7, 2000, the date of demutualization of Metropolitan Life, MetLife, Inc. distributed to the Trust shares of Common Stock for the benefit of policyholders of Metropolitan Life. 
 Withdrawals by Beneficiaries of Trust Shares, transactions by Beneficiaries under the Purchase and Sale Program (as defined below), and escheatment of unclaimed Trust Shares resulted in a net decrease in the number of Trust Shares from at December 31, 2021 to at December 31, 2022. See Termination of the Trust. 
 A Trust Interest entitles the Beneficiary to certain rights, including the right to: (i) receive dividends distributed upon Trust Shares; (ii) have Trust Shares withdrawn from the Trust to be sold for cash through a purchase and sale program established by MetLife, Inc. pursuant to the Plan (the Purchase and Sale Program (iii) deposit in the Trust additional shares of Common Stock purchased through the Purchase and Sale Program; (iv) withdraw Trust Shares, including for exchange in connection with an exchange offer for Common Stock; and (v) instruct the Trustee to vote the Trust Shares on certain matters, each as further described in and limited by the terms of the Trust Agreement. The Trustee has no beneficial interest in the Trust Shares. 
 The Trust accounts for Trust Interests transactions as follows: 
 (i) Dividends distributed upon Trust Shares are recorded as both net investment income when earned and distributions to holders of Trust Interests when due; 
 (ii) Gains (losses) on Trust Shares withdrawn from the Trust and sold for cash through the Purchase and Sale Program are recorded as net realized investment gains (losses) relating to distributions to holders of Trust Interests and represent the difference between the sales proceeds and the cost basis of such shares. The cost basis of such shares is recorded as a reduction in Trust Interests at cost and classified as Trust Interests redeemed; 
 (iii) Deposits into the Trust of additional shares of Common Stock purchased through the Purchase and Sale Program are recorded at acquisition cost and classified as Trust Interests issued; 
 (iv) Withdrawals of Trust Shares are recorded as reductions in Trust Interests at cost and classified as Trust Interests withdrawn; and 
 (v) Escheatment of unclaimed Trust Shares is recorded as a reduction in Trust Interests at cost and classified as Trust Interests escheated.

 DESCRIPTION OF REGISTRANT S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 
 The following description of the interests in MetLife Policyholder Trust (the Trust Interests registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is a summary and does not purport to be complete. It is qualified in its entirety by reference to the MetLife Policyholder Trust Agreement, dated as of November 3, 1999, by and among by and among Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, MetLife, Inc., Wilmington Trust Company (not in its individual capacity but solely as trustee for the Trust, the Trustee and ChaseMellon Shareholder Services, L.L.C., as custodian (now known as Computershare Inc., the Custodian ), as amended on November 8, 2001 (the Trust Agreement ), in connection with the conversion of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company from a mutual life insurance company to a stock life insurance company under the Plan of Reorganization, dated September 28, 1999, as amended, of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (the Plan ), which has been previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 Trust Interests 
 The Trust Interests were issued to certain policyholders of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Trust Eligible Policyholders pursuant to the Plan. Under the Plan and the Trust Agreement, each Trust Eligible Policyholder was allocated a number of Trust Interests equal to the number of shares of Common Stock, par value 0.01 per share, of MetLife, Inc. Common Stock ), allocated to the Trust Eligible Policyholder in accordance with the Plan. The assets of the Trust are principally the shares of Common Stock issued to the Trust (the Trust Shares for the benefit of the Trust Eligible Policyholders and permitted transferees (collectively, the Beneficiaries ). The Trust Shares are held in the name of the Trustee, on behalf of the Trust, which has legal title over the Trust Shares. The Beneficiaries do not have legal title to any part of the assets of the Trust. The Trust Interests represent undivided fractional interests in the Trust Shares and other assets of the Trust beneficially owned by a Trust Beneficiary through the Custodian. A Trust Interest entitles the Beneficiary to certain rights, including the right to (i) receive dividends distributed upon Trust Shares (ii) have Trust Shares withdrawn from the Trust to be sold for cash through a purchase and sale program established by MetLife, Inc. pursuant to the Plan (the Purchase and Sale Program (iii) deposit in the Trust additional shares of Common Stock purchased through the Purchase and Sale Program (iv) withdraw Trust Shares and (v) instruct the Trustee to vote the Trust Shares on certain matters each as further described in and limited by the terms of the Trust Agreement. The Trustee has no beneficial interest in the Trust Shares. 
 As a general rule, Beneficiaries are prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, encumbering or granting any option or any other interest in their Trust Interests however, Trust Interests may be transferred (i) from the estate of a deceased Beneficiary to one or more beneficiaries taking by operation of law or pursuant to testamentary succession, (ii) to the spouse or issue of a Beneficiary or to an entity, selected by a Beneficiary, provided that transfers to such entity are deductible for U.S. federal income, gift and estate tax purposes under Sections 170, 2055 and 2522 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or to a trust established for the exclusive benefit of one or more of the following (x) Beneficiaries, (y) individuals described in this clause (ii), or (z) entities described in this clause (ii), (iii) to a trust established to hold Trust Interests on behalf of an employee benefit plan, (iv) if the Beneficiary is not a natural person, by operation of law to the surviving entity upon the merger or consolidation of such Beneficiary into another entity, to the purchaser of substantially all the assets of such Beneficiary or to the appropriate persons upon the dissolution, termination or winding up of such Beneficiary, (v) by operation of law as a consequence of the bankruptcy or insolvency of such Beneficiary or the granting of relief to such Beneficiary under the U.S. federal bankruptcy laws, or (vi) from a trust holding an insurance policy or annuity contract on behalf of the insured person under such policy or contract, to such persons as will be required pursuant to the terms of such trust. 
 In addition, if the Board of Directors of MetLife, Inc. (the Board determines that there is, at any time, a material risk that the assets of the Trust may be characterized as plan assets under the U.S. Department of Labor Reg. Section 2510.3-101, the Board may direct the Trustee to distribute to the Custodian, for distribution to one or more Beneficiaries, a number of Trust Shares (not to exceed the total number of such Beneficiaries Trust Interests) as the Board may determine to be necessary or appropriate to ensure that the assets of the Trust will not be so characterized as plan assets . 
 A transferee of Trust Interests will become subject to the Trust Agreement. Trust Interests are held in the name of the Custodian, which keeps a record of the Trust Interests of the Beneficiaries on a book-entry system maintained by the Custodian. The Trust Interests are not be represented by certificates or other evidences of ownership. 
 The Plan provides that Beneficiaries may instruct the program agent for the Purchase and Sale Program to withdraw their allocated shares from the Trust for sale through the Purchase and Sale Program. Beneficiaries allocated less than 1,000 shares of Common Stock under the Plan are also entitled to purchase in the Purchase and Sale Program additional shares to bring their 
 1 

Trust Interests up to 1,000 shares, subject to a minimum of 250 per purchase (or such lesser amount that would cause the Beneficiary to hold the 1,000 maximum number of Trust Interests). The number of Trust Interests allocated to Beneficiaries will be adjusted for any shares of Common Stock purchased or sold in the Purchase and Sale Program such that the Trust Interests held by a Beneficiary will always equal the number of shares of Common Stock allocated to the Beneficiary. 
 Beneficiaries may withdraw all, but not less than all, of their allocated shares of Common Stock at any time by providing written notice to the Custodian. 
 The Trust Agreement provides the Trustee with directions as to the manner in which to vote, assent or consent the Trust Shares at all times during the term of the Trust. On all matters brought for a vote before the stockholders of MetLife, Inc., with the exception of a Beneficiary Consent Matter (as defined below), the Trustee will vote, assent or consent the Trust Shares in favor of or in opposition to such matter, or abstain from voting on such matter, in accordance with the recommendation given by the Board to MetLife, Inc.'s stockholders or, if no such recommendation is given, as directed by the Board. On all Beneficiary Consent Matters, the Trustee will vote all of the Trust Shares in favor of, in opposition to or abstain from the matter in the same ratio as the Trust Interests of the Beneficiaries that returned voting instructions to the Trustee indicated preferences for voting in favor of, in opposition to or abstaining from such matter. The Trust Agreement also contains provisions allowing Beneficiaries to instruct the Custodian to withdraw their allocated Trust Shares to participate in any tender or exchange offer for the Common Stock and to make any cash or share election, or perfect any dissenter s rights, in connection with a merger of MetLife, Inc. 
 A Beneficiary Consent Matter is (i) a contested election of directors or, subject to certain conditions, the removal of a director, (ii) a merger or consolidation, a sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets or a recapitalization or dissolution of MetLife, Inc., if it requires a vote of stockholders under applicable Delaware law, (iii) any transaction that would result in an exchange or conversion of the Trust Shares for cash, securities or other property, (iv) proposals submitted to stockholders requiring the Board to amend MetLife, Inc. s Stockholder Rights Plan, or redeem rights under that plan, other than a proposal with respect to which MetLife, Inc. has received advice of nationally-recognized legal counsel to the effect that the proposal is not a proper subject for stockholder action under Delaware law. 
 Proxy solicitation materials, annual reports and information statements received by the Custodian in connection with any matter not involving a Beneficiary Consent Matter will be made available by MetLife, Inc. to Beneficiaries for their information on a website maintained by MetLife, Inc. or by mail upon request and at MetLife, Inc. s expense, but voting instructions to the Trustee will not be solicited and, if instructions are received, they will not be binding on the Trustee. 
 The Trust Agreement provides that regular cash dividends, if any, collected or received by the Trustee with respect to the Trust Shares will be distributed by the Custodian semi-annually to the Beneficiaries within 90 days after receipt by the Trustee. Distributions of all other cash dividends will be made by the Custodian to the Beneficiaries on the first business day following the 30th day after the Trust receives the dividends. Alternatively, the Trustee may arrange with MetLife, Inc. for the direct payment by MetLife, Inc. of such cash dividends to the Beneficiaries. The Trust Agreement further provides that pending such distribution, cash dividends (unless distributed directly by MetLife, Inc. to the Beneficiaries) shall be invested by the Trustee in short-term obligations of or guaranteed by the United States, or any agency or instrumentality thereof, and in certificates of deposit of any bank or trust company having a combined capital and surplus not less than 500 million. Dividends or other distributions in Common Stock will be allocated to the Beneficiaries and held by the Trustee as Trust Shares. Generally, all other distributions by MetLife, Inc. to its stockholders will be held and distributed by the Trustee to the Custodian and by the Custodian to the Beneficiaries in proportion to their Trust Interests within 60 days of receipt of such distribution by the Trustee, subject to limited exceptions. 
 The Trust will terminate on the 90th day after the date on which the Trustee will have received notice from MetLife, Inc. that the number of Trust Shares held by the Trust is equal to 10 or less of the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock or on the date on which the last Trust Share will have been withdrawn, distributed or exchanged. The Trust may be terminated upon the first to occur of any of the following (i) on the 90th day after the date on which the Trustee receives written notice from MetLife, Inc., given in MetLife, Inc. s discretion at any time, that the number of Trust Shares is 25 or less of the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, (ii) on the date on which the Trustee receives written notice from MetLife, Inc. that the Board has determined, as a result of any amendment of, or change (including any announced prospective change) in the laws (or any regulations thereunder) of the United States or any State, Commonwealth or other political subdivision or authority thereof or therein, or any official administrative pronouncement or judicial decision interpreting or applying such law or regulation, or any changes in the facts or circumstances relating to the Trust, that maintaining the Trust is or is reasonably expected to become burdensome to MetLife, Inc. or the Beneficiaries, (iii) on the date on which any rights issued under a stockholder rights plan adopted by MetLife, Inc. and held by the Trust become separately tradeable from the Trust Shares to which they relate, or (iv) on the date on which there is an entry of a final order for 
 2 

termination or dissolution of the Trust or similar relief by a court of competent jurisdiction. The Trust may also have to be terminated at some point in time if the rule against perpetuities applies. 
 Upon termination of the Trust, the remaining Trust Shares will be distributed in book-entry form to each Beneficiary, or as otherwise directed by such Beneficiary, if book entry shares are permitted by applicable law, together with the Beneficiary s proportionate share of all unpaid distributions and dividends and interest earned thereon. The Trust Agreement provides that MetLife, Inc. may, in its discretion, offer to purchase such shares at the market price of the Common Stock at the time of the purchase. 
 The Trust Agreement may be amended from time to time by the Trustee, the Custodian, MetLife, Inc. and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, without the consent of any Beneficiary, (i) to cure any ambiguity, correct or supplement any provision therein that may be inconsistent with any other provision therein, or to make any other provision with respect to matters or questions arising under the Trust Agreement, which will not be inconsistent with the other provisions of the Trust Agreement, provided that the action does not adversely affect the Trust Interests of the Beneficiaries, (ii) to modify, eliminate or add to any provisions of the Trust Agreement to such extent as will be necessary to ensure that the Trust will be classified for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a grantor trust at all times or to ensure that the Trust will not be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or (iii) to reflect the effect of a merger or consolidation in which MetLife, Inc. is not the surviving corporation and the other company into which MetLife, Inc. is merged or consolidated assumes its obligations under the Trust Agreement. The Trust Agreement may also be amended or provisions thereof waived with the consent of Beneficiaries representing more than one-half of the Trust Interests, provided that no such amendment or waiver will, without the consent of each Beneficiary affected thereby, reduce the Trust Interests or otherwise eliminate or materially postpone the right of any Beneficiary to receive dividends or other distributions or to make elections under the Purchase and Sale Program or to withdraw Trust Shares. 
 Beneficiaries will not have any preemptive rights with respect to the Trust Interests. There is no provision for any sinking fund with respect to the Trust Interests. 
 Common Stock 
 The following description of MetLife, Inc. s Common Stock registered pursuant to the Exchange Act, is a summary and does not purport to be complete. It is qualified in its entirety by reference to MetLife, Inc. s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended (the Certificate of Incorporation ), and the amended and restated by-laws (the By-Laws ), each of which MetLife, Inc. has previously filed with the SEC, and applicable law. 
 Dividends 
 The holders of Common Stock, after any preferences of holders of any preferred stock, are entitled to receive dividends as determined by the Board. The declaration and payment of Common Stock dividends will also depend on MetLife, Inc. s financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, future prospects, regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by MetLife, Inc. s insurance subsidiaries and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. There is no requirement or assurance that MetLife, Inc. will declare and pay any dividends.

In addition, (i) MetLife, Inc. s 6.40 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066, (ii) MetLife, Inc. s 10.75 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2069, (iii) upon an exchange of the 7.875 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Exchangeable Surplus Trust Securities of MetLife Capital Trust IV, MetLife, Inc. s related 7.875 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2067, and (iv) MetLife, Inc. s 9.250 Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2068, all prohibit the declaration or payment of dividends or distributions on Common Stock under certain circumstances if interest is not paid in full on such securities, whether because of a mandatory or optional payment deferral, subject to certain exceptions. 
 Voting Rights

 3 

Liquidation and Dissolution 
 In the event of MetLife, Inc. s liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, the holders of Common Stock are entitled to share equally and ratably in MetLife, Inc. s assets, if any, remaining after the payment of all of MetLife, Inc. s liabilities and the liquidation preference of any outstanding class or series of preferred stock. 
 Other Rights

 Transfer Agent and Registrar 
 The transfer agent and registrar for the Common Stock is Computershare Inc. (successor in interest to Mellon Investor Services LLC). 
 Certain Provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws and in Delaware and New York Law 
 A number of provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws deal with matters of corporate governance and rights of stockholders. The following discussion is a general summary of selected provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws and regulatory provisions that might be deemed to have a potential anti-takeover effect. These provisions may have the effect of discouraging a future takeover attempt which is not approved by the Board but which individual stockholders may deem to be in their best interests or in which stockholders may receive a substantial premium for their shares over then current market prices. As a result, stockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have an opportunity to do so. Such provisions will also render the removal of the incumbent Board or management more difficult. Some provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and the New York Insurance Law may also have an anti-takeover effect. The following description of selected provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws and selected provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and the New York Insurance Law is necessarily general and reference should be made in each case to the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, which are filed with the SEC, and to the provisions of those laws. 
 Exercise of Duties by the Board 
 The Certificate of Incorporation provides that while the Trust is in existence, each of MetLife, Inc. s directors is required, in exercising his or her duties as a director, to take the interests of the Beneficiaries into account as if they were holders of the shares of Common Stock held in the Trust, except to the extent that any such director determines, based on advice of counsel, that to do so would violate his or her duties as a director under Delaware law. 
 Restriction on Maximum Number of Directors and Filling of Vacancies on the Board 
 Pursuant to the By-Laws and subject to the rights of the holders of any class of preferred stock, the number of directors may be fixed from time to time exclusively by resolution adopted by a majority of the entire Board, but the Board will at no time consist of fewer than three directors. Stockholders may remove a director with or without cause at a meeting of the stockholders by a vote of a majority of the combined voting power of the outstanding stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, in which case the vacancy caused by such removal may be filled at such meeting by the stockholders entitled to vote for the election of the director so removed. Any vacancy on the board of directors, including a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors or resulting from a removal where the stockholders have not filled the vacancy, subject to the rights of the holders of any class of preferred stock, may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum. These provisions give incumbent directors significant authority that may have the effect of limiting the ability of stockholders to effect a change in management. 
 Advance Notice Requirements for Nomination of Directors and Presentation of New Business at Meetings of Stockholders Action by Written Consent 
 The By-Laws provide for advance notice and other provisions in respect of stockholder proposals and nominations for director. In addition, pursuant to the provisions of both the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws, stockholder action may not be taken by written consent. Rather, any action taken by the stockholders must be effected at a duly called meeting. The chairman, the chief executive officer or the secretary pursuant to a board resolution or, under some circumstances, the president or a director who also is an officer, may call a special meeting. The By-Laws also permit stockholders representing ownership of 25 or more of the combined voting power of the outstanding shares of Common Stock to call a special meeting of the stockholders, provided that the stockholders satisfy the requirements specified in the By-Laws. These provisions make it more difficult for a stockholder to place a proposal or nomination on the meeting agenda and prohibit a stockholder from taking 
 4 

action without a meeting, and therefore may reduce the likelihood that a stockholder will seek to take independent action to replace directors or with respect to other matters that are not supported by management for stockholder vote. 
 Limitations on Director Liability 
 The Certificate of Incorporation contains a provision that is designed to limit the directors liability to the extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law and any amendments to that law. 
 Specifically, directors will not be held liable to MetLife, Inc. or MetLife, Inc. s stockholders for monetary damages for an act or omission in their capacity as a director, except for liability as a result of 
 a breach of the duty of loyalty to MetLife, Inc. or MetLife, Inc. s stockholders 
 acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law 
 payment of an improper dividend or improper redemption or repurchase of MetLife, Inc. s Common Stock under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law or 
 any transaction from which the director received an improper personal benefit. 
 The principal effect of the limitation on liability provision is that a stockholder is unable to prosecute an action for monetary damages against one of MetLife, Inc. s directors unless the stockholder can demonstrate one of the specified bases for liability. This provision, however, does not eliminate or limit director liability arising in connection with causes of action brought under the federal securities laws. The Certificate of Incorporation also does not eliminate the directors duty of care. The inclusion of the limitation on liability provision in the certificate may, however, discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for a breach of their fiduciary duties, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited MetLife, Inc. and its stockholders. This provision should not affect the availability of equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission based upon a director s breach of the duty of care. 
 The By-Laws also provide that MetLife, Inc. will indemnify its directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. MetLife, Inc. is required to indemnify its directors and officers for all judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement, legal fees and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with pending or threatened legal proceedings because of the director s or officer s position with MetLife, Inc. or another entity, including Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, that the director or officer serves at MetLife, Inc. s request, subject to certain conditions, and to advance funds to MetLife, Inc. s directors and officers to enable them to defend against such proceedings. To receive indemnification, the director or officer must succeed in the legal proceeding or act in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to MetLife, Inc. s best interests and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be lawful. 
 Business Combination Statute 
 In addition, as a Delaware corporation with a class of voting stock listed on a national securities exchange, MetLife, Inc. is subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, unless MetLife, Inc. elects in the Certificate of Incorporation not to be governed by the provisions of Section 203. MetLife, Inc. has not made that election. Section 203 can affect the ability of an interested stockholder of MetLife, Inc. to engage in certain business combinations, including mergers, consolidations or acquisitions of additional MetLife, Inc. shares for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. An interested stockholder is defined to include any person owning, directly or indirectly, 15 or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation. The provisions of Section 203 are not applicable in some circumstances, including those in which (1) the business combination or transaction which results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder is approved by the corporation s board of directors prior to the time the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder or (2) the interested stockholder, upon consummation of such transaction, owns at least 85 of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding prior to such transaction. 
 Restrictions on Acquisitions of Securities 
 The insurance laws and regulations of New York, the jurisdiction in which MetLife, Inc. s principal insurance subsidiary, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, is organized, may delay or impede a business combination involving MetLife, Inc. In addition to the limitations described in the immediately preceding paragraph, the New York Insurance Law prohibits any person from acquiring control of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, either directly or indirectly through any acquisition of control of MetLife, Inc., without the prior approval of the New York Superintendent of Financial Services. That law presumes that control exists where any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds the power to vote 10 or more of MetLife, Inc. s outstanding voting stock, unless the New York Superintendent of Financial Services, upon application, determines otherwise. Even persons who do not acquire beneficial ownership of more than 10 of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock may be deemed to have acquired such control, if the New York Superintendent of Financial Services determines that such persons,
