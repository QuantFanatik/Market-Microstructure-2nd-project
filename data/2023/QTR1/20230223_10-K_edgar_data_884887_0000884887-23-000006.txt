Item 1. Business. 
 
 General 
 We are one of the leading cruise companies in the world. We own and operate three global cruise brands: Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises (collectively, our "Global Brands"). We also own a 50 joint venture interest in TUI Cruises GmbH ("TUIC"), which operates the German brands TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises (collectively, our "Partner Brands"). We account for our investments in our Partner Brands under the equity method of accounting. Together, our Global Brands and our Partner Brands have a combined fleet of 64 ships in the cruise vacation industry with an aggregate capacity of approximately 150,005 berths as of December 31, 2022. 
 Our ships offer a selection of worldwide itineraries that call on more than 1,000 destinations on all seven continents. In addition to our headquarters in Miami, Florida, we have offices and a network of international representatives around the world, which primarily focus on sales and market development. 
 We compete principally by operating valued brands that offer exceptional service provided by our crew and on the basis of innovation and quality of ships, variety of itineraries, choice of destinations and price. We believe that our commitment to build state-of-the-art ships and to invest in the maintenance and upgrade of our fleet to, among other things, incorporate many of our latest signature innovations, allows us to continue to attract new and loyal repeat guests. 
 Royal Caribbean was founded in 1968 as a partnership. Its corporate structure has evolved over the years and, the current parent corporation, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., was incorporated on July 23, 1985 in the Republic of Liberia under the Business Corporation Act of Liberia. 
 As a result of the global pandemic impact of COVID-19, we paused our guest cruise operations in March 2020 and began resuming guest cruise operations in 2021, with our full fleet in service by June 2022. We continue to prioritize our financial recovery and the further enhancement of our financial results and liquidity. 
 
 Our Global Brands 
 Our Global Brands include Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, and Silversea Cruises. We believe our Global Brands possess the versatility to enter multiple cruise market segments within the cruise vacation industry. Although each of our Global Brands has its own marketing style, as well as ships and crews of various sizes, the nature of the products sold and services delivered by our Global Brands share a common base (i.e., the sale and provision of cruise vacations). Our Global Brands also offer similar itineraries as well as similar cost and revenue components. In addition, our Global Brands have historically sourced passengers from similar markets around the world and operated in similar economic environments with a significant degree of commercial overlap. As a result, we strategically manage our Global Brands as a single business with the ultimate objective of maximizing long-term shareholder value. 
 Royal Caribbean International 
 Royal Caribbean International is the world's largest cruise brand. The brand competes in both the contemporary and premium segments of the cruise vacation industry and appeals to families with children of all ages, as well as both older and younger couples. Royal Caribbean International offers cruises and land destinations that generally feature a casual ambiance, as well as a variety of activities and entertainment venues. We believe that the quality of the Royal Caribbean International brand allows it to achieve market coverage that is among the broadest of any of the major cruise brands in the cruise vacation industry. Royal Caribbean International s strategy is to attract an array of vacationing guests by offering a wide variety of itineraries to destinations worldwide, including Alaska, Asia, Australia, the Bahamas, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, Europe, the Panama Canal and New Zealand, with cruise lengths generally ranging from two to 19 nights. Royal Caribbean International offers multiple innovative options for onboard dining, entertainment and other onboard activities. Because of the brand s ability to deliver extensive and innovative product offerings at an excellent value to consumers, we believe Royal Caribbean International is well positioned to attract new consumers to cruising and to continue to bring loyal repeat guests back for their next vacation. 
 Royal Caribbean International operates 26 ships with an aggregate capacity of approximately 94,100 berths. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, Royal Caribbean International had four ships on order with an aggregate capacity of approximately 22,500 berths. The ships on order include the first three ships of a new generation of vessels, known as the Icon-class, and our sixth Oasis-class ship, Utopia of the Seas . The first Icon-class ship, Icon of the Seas, is expected to be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2023 and enter service in the first quarter of 2024, and the second and third Icon-class ships, are expected to be delivered in the second quarters of 2025 and 2026, respectively. Utopia of the Seas is expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 2 

Celebrity Cruises 
 Celebrity Cruises is positioned within the luxury segment of the cruise vacation industry. Celebrity Cruises strategy is to target affluent consumers by delivering a destination-rich experience on upscale ships that offer, among other things, culinary excellence, world-class service, luxurious spaces and accommodations, and holistic wellness experiences. Celebrity Cruises offers a range of itineraries to destinations, including Alaska, Asia, Australia, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, Europe, the Galapagos Islands, Hawaii, New Zealand, the Panama Canal and South America, with cruise lengths ranging from three to 18 nights. 
 Celebrity Cruises operates 15 ships with an aggregate capacity of approximately 32,465 berths. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, Celebrity Cruises had one Edge-class ship on order with an aggregate capacity of approximately 3,250 berths. This ship, Celebrity Ascent , is expected to be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2023. In addition, we have an agreement in place with Chantiers de l Atlantique to build an additional Edge-class ship with capacity of approximately 3,250 berths, estimated for delivery in 2025, if certain conditions are met. 
 Silversea Cruises 
 Silversea Cruises is an ultra-luxury and expedition cruise line with smaller ships, high standards of accommodations, fine dining, personalized service and exotic itineraries. Silversea Cruises delivers distinctive destination experiences by visiting unique and remote destinations, including the Galapagos Islands, Antarctica and the Arctic with cruise itineraries generally ranging from five to 24 nights. 
 Silversea Cruises operates 11 ships, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 4,150 berths, including the brand's newest ship, Silver Endeavour , which was acquired in the third quarter of 2022 and commenced operations in the fourth quarter of 2022. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, Silversea Cruises had on order two ships of a new generation, known as the Evolution-class, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,460 berths, which are expected to be delivered in the second quarters of 2023 and 2024, respectively. 
 The expected delivery dates for all of our ships on order are subject to change in the event of shipyard construction delays or in the event we agree to scope changes which impact the delivery timelines. See Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion on shipyard operations. 
 
 Our Partner Brands 
 Our Global Brands are complemented by our interest in TUIC, our 50 -owned joint venture that operates the German brands TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises (collectively, our "Partner Brands"). 
 TUIC is a joint venture owned 50 by us and 50 by TUI AG, a German tourism company, which is designed to serve the contemporary and premium segments of the German cruise market by offering products tailored for German guests. All onboard activities, services, shore excursions and menu offerings are designed to suit the preferences of this target market. 
 TUI Cruises operates seven ships, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 17,700 berths. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, TUI Cruises had three ships on order with an aggregate capacity of approximately 11,100 berths, that are expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2024, the fourth quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2026, respectively. 
 Hapag-Lloyd Cruises operates two luxury liners and three smaller expedition ships, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,590 berths. Hapag-Lloyd Cruises did not have any ships on order as of December 31, 2022. 
 Refer to Note 7 . Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further details. 
 
 Industry 
 The cruising industry has been considered a well-established vacation sector in the North American, European and Australian markets and a developing sector in several other emerging markets. We believe that cruising will continue to be a popular vacation choice due to its inherent value, extensive itineraries and variety of shipboard and shoreside activities. The Company and other industry participants voluntarily suspended operations in March of 2020 and gradually resumed full operations starting in the second half of 2021 through the first half of 2022. As a result, comparative information regarding market penetration and other indicators are not meaningful for 2020, 2021, and 2022. For the five year period prior to 2020, industry data indicated that market penetration rates were still low and that a significant portion of cruise 
 
 3 

guests carried in those years were first-time cruisers. We believe this presents an opportunity for operational and financial recovery and long-term growth for the industry. 
 During the five year period from 2015 through 2019, industry market penetration rates (computed based on the number of annual cruise guests as a percentage of the total population) grew from 3.36 to 3.89 for North America, from 1.25 to 1.41 for Europe, and from 0.08 to 0.20 for Asia/Pacific. The increased penetration shows the continued growth potential in the markets most served by the industry. 
 The global cruise fleet was served by a weighted average of approximately 634,000 berths during 2022 with approximately 359 ships at the end of 2022. As of December 31, 2022, there were approximately 63 ships on order with an estimated 143,000 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the global cruise market through 2028, not taking into account ships taken out of service or ordered during these periods. Cruise ships in the industry were taken out of service at an accelerated rate and new ship orders were deferred due to global cruise operation restrictions in 2020 and limited sailings in 2021 and 2022 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The global cruise industry carried approximately 30 million cruise guests in 2019 and approximately 28.5 million in 2018. 
 The following table details the growth in global weighted average berths and the percentage of North American, European and Asia/Pacific cruise guests for 2022 and for each of the five years from 2015 through 2019:

 ___________________________________________________________________ 
 (1) Historically, we have reported annual information for comparability across periods. The 2020 suspension of global cruise operations as a result of COVID-19 and the gradual resumption of full operations starting in the second half of 2021 through the first half of 2022 do not allow for a meaningful comparison to prior years' information and, as such, 2020 and 2021 data has been excluded from this table. 
 (2) Source: The estimates of the number of global cruise guests and the weighted-average supply of berths marketed globally are based on a combination of data that we obtain from various publicly available cruise industry trade information sources. We use data obtained from Seatrade Insider, Cruise Industry News and company press releases to estimate weighted-average supply of berths and CLIA and G.P. Wild to estimate cruise guest information. For 2022, cruise guest information includes data through the third quarter of 2022. In addition, our estimates incorporate our own analysis utilizing the same publicly available cruise industry data as a base. 
 (3) Total berths include our berths related to our Global Brands and Partner Brands. 
 (4) Our estimates include the United States and Canada. 
 (5) Our estimates include European countries relevant to the industry (most notably: the Nordics, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom). 
 (6) Our estimates include Southeast Asia (most notably: Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines), East Asia (pre-2022, most notably: China and Japan), South Asia (most notably: India) and Oceania (most notably: Australia and New Zealand) regions. The decrease in Asia/Pacific cruise guests from 2019 to 2022 is partly driven by China remaining closed given its continued COVID-19 restrictions. 
 Competition 
 We compete with a number of cruise lines and other land-based vacations. Our principal competitors are Carnival Corporation plc, which owns, among other brands, Aida Cruises, Carnival Cruise Line, Costa Cruises, Cunard Line, Holland America Line, P O Cruises, Princess Cruises and Seabourn; Disney Cruise Line; MSC Cruises; Norwegian 
 
 4 

Cruise Line Holdings Ltd, which owns Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises, and Regent Seven Seas Cruises; and Virgin Voyages. Cruise lines also compete with other vacation alternatives such as land-based resort hotels, internet-based alternative lodging sites and sightseeing destinations for consumers leisure time. 
 
 Operating Strategies 
 Our mission is to deliver the best vacation experiences to our guests, responsibly. We continue to prioritize operating strategies that support this mission as well as operating strategies that support our financial recovery and the further enhancement of our financial results and liquidity. We strive to execute these strategies in a socially and environmentally responsible manner, working with our various business and community partners as we build toward a more sustainable cruise industry. 
 Our Company's operating strategies are as follows: 
 deliver the best vacation experiences to our guests, responsibly; 
 protect the health, safety and security of our guests and employees; 
 deepen our customer relationships in order to enhance our revenues; 
 focus on cost efficiency, adequate cash and liquidity, and strengthen our balance sheet, with the overall goals of maximizing our return on invested capital and shareholder value; 
 protect the environment in which our vessels and organization operate, with a focus on decarbonization; 
 invest in our workforce in order to better serve our global guest base and grow our business, and promote gender equality, diversity and inclusion; 
 increase the awareness and market penetration of our brands globally; 
 strategically invest in our fleet through the upgrade and maintenance of existing ships and the transfer of key innovations, while prudently expanding our fleet with new state-of-the-art cruise ships; 
 capitalize on the portability and flexibility of our ships by deploying them into those markets and itineraries that provide opportunities to optimize returns, while continuing our focus on existing key markets; 
 provide extraordinary destination experiences and state-of-the-art port facilities to our guests; 
 continue to deploy technology capabilities and advanced uses of data and analytics to deliver innovative customer experiences as well as to create operational efficiencies that enhance employee satisfaction; and 
 maintain strong relationships with travel advisors, while enhancing our consumer outreach and e-commerce programs 
 Safety, security and health policies 
 We are committed to protecting the health, safety and security of our guests, employees and others working on our behalf. Our efforts in these areas are managed by several departments within the Company that are responsible for maritime safety, global security, environmental stewardship and medical/public health activities. We also have a dedicated committee of our Board of Directors, the Safety, Environment, Sustainability and Health Committee, which is responsible for reviewing and monitoring our overall strategies, policies and programs that impact the safety and health of our guests and crew. Refer to the Regulation - Safety and Security Regulations section below for further information. 
 Consumer engagement 
 We place a strong focus on identifying the needs of our guests and creating product features and innovations that our customers value. We are focused on targeting and acquiring high-value guests by better understanding consumer data and insights to create communication strategies that resonate with our target audiences. 
 We target customers at important consumer decision points and identify underlying needs for which guests are willing to pay a premium. We rely on various programs and technologies during the cruise-planning, cruising and after-cruise periods aimed at increasing ticket prices, onboard revenues and occupancy. We have and expect to strategically invest in projects on our ships that we believe drive marketability, profitability and improve the guest experience. 
 
 5 

Focus on cost efficiency, capital allocation, adequate cash and liquidity and improving our balance sheet 
 We are focused on maintaining a strong liquidity position and a balanced debt maturity profile, while making progress towards achieving an unsecured balance sheet, obtaining cost efficiencies including lowering interest expense, and reducing leverage. For example, in early 2023, we extended our revolving credit facility with our key relationship banks to ensure adequate liquidity on a going-forward basis. We believe these strategies enhance our ability to achieve our overall goal of maximizing our return on invested capital and long-term shareholder value. 
 Protect the environment 
 We are focused on the environmental health of the marine environment and communities in which we operate. This includes our Destination Net Zero strategy, and our partnership with the World Wildlife Fund, which together aim to reduce our carbon footprint, raise awareness about ocean conservation among guests and crew, and support ocean conservation projects around the world. 
 Destination Net Zero is our decarbonization strategy that focuses on how to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and deliver a net zero capable ship by 2035. This strategy also includes achieving reductions on our carbon intensity by double digits by 2025, compared to 2019. Destination Net Zero s four-pronged approach includes the modernization of our global brands fleet through the introduction of new energy-efficient and alternatively fueled vessels, continued investment in energy efficiency programs, development of alternative fuel and alternative power solutions, and optimized deployment and integration of strategic shore-based supply chains. While we continue to develop our roadmap to Destination Net Zero, it is already clear that our strategy will require new fuels and technologies that are not available today. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our sustainability activities, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, could result in reputational risks, increased costs and other risks for a discussion of the risks associated with our environmental initiatives. 
 Our long-term partnership with the World Wildlife Fund focuses on greenhouse gas ("GHG") reduction strategies, sustainable sourcing of food supplies, waste management, sustainable destinations and guest education on ocean conservation issues, which supports onboard conservation efforts such as our reduced use of plastics. We are also committed to assessing and managing potential impacts related to our operations in the communities in which we operate. 
 To achieve our carbon intensity goals, we have invested and plan to continue investing in energy and carbon efficient technologies included in the design of our new vessels, our ongoing fleet energy management program and other technologies. These investments include installation costs related to advanced emissions purification systems ("AEP") and other technologies that are expected to reduce fuel consumption and carbon footprint. 
 We believe in transparent reporting on our environmental and sustainability stewardship, as well as our social and governance efforts, and have annually published a Sustainability Report since 2008. This report, the current version of which is accessible on our corporate website, highlights our progress with regards to those environmental, social and governance aspects of our business that we believe are most significant to our organization and stakeholders. In addition to providing an overview on our sustainability efforts, the report references the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative and is aligned with the Sustainable Accounting Standards Boards Industry Standards for Cruise Lines. We continue to work on an initial report following the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which we plan to file in 2023. Our corporate website also provides information about our environmental performance goals and sustainability initiatives. The foregoing information contained on our website is not part of any of these reports and is not incorporated by reference herein or in any other report or document we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Refer to the Regulation - Environmental Regulations section below for further information. 
 Investing in our workforce and promoting equality, diversity and inclusion 
 We believe that our employees, both shipboard and shoreside, are a critical success factor for our business. We strive to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain the best employees, who provide our guests with extraordinary vacations. Our ability to attract, engage, and retain key employees has been and will remain critical to our success. Our Talent and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors oversees the Company's human capital management strategies, including initiatives for talent diversity, equity and inclusion, talent management, and corporate culture. 
 We focus on providing our employees with a competitive compensation structure, development opportunities, and other personal and professional growth opportunities in order to strengthen and support our human capital. We also select, develop and have strategies to retain high performing leaders to advance the enterprise now and in the future. To that end, we pay special attention to identifying high performing potential leaders and developing bench strength so these leaders can assume leadership roles throughout the organization. 
 
 6 

We strive to maintain a work environment that reinforces collaboration, motivation and innovation, and believe that maintaining a strong employee-focused culture is beneficial to the growth and expansion of our business. We foster diversity and inclusion among our broad employee base. Refer to the Human Capital section below for further information. 
 Global awareness and market penetration 
 We increase brand awareness and market penetration of our cruise brands in various ways, including the use of communication strategies and marketing campaigns designed to emphasize the qualities of each brand, especially among target groups. Our marketing strategies include the use of travel advisors, traditional media, mobile and digital media as well as social media, influencers and brand websites. Our brands engage past and potential guests by collaborating with travel partners and through call centers, international offices and international representatives. In addition, our Global Brands target repeat guests with exclusive benefits offered through their respective loyalty programs. 
 We sell and market our Global Brands to guests outside of the United States and Canada through the combined efforts of internationally focused internal resources and a network of independent international representatives located throughout the world. While the majority of our guests for our Global Brands come from North America, we also sell and market our cruise brands to guests in countries outside of North America by tailoring itineraries and onboard product offerings to the cultural characteristics and preferences of our international guests. In addition, we explore opportunities that may arise to acquire or develop brands tailored to specific markets. 
 Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Conducting business globally results in increased costs and other risks for a discussion of the risks associated with our international operations. 
 Delivery of state-of-the-art cruise ships, and fleet upgrade and maintenance 
 We place a strong focus on innovation, which we seek to achieve by introducing new concepts on our new ships and continuously making improvements to our existing fleet, such as large-scale atriums, double hulls for increased safety, and advanced steel structures. We are expanding our innovation efforts to cover multiple fronts, including naval and architectural design, guest facing features, energy efficiency, sustainability, and safety. 
 We are committed to building state-of-the-art ships at a moderate growth rate and we believe our success in this area provides us with a competitive advantage. Our newer vessels traditionally generate higher revenue yield premiums and are more efficient and environmentally friendly to operate than older vessels. 
 In 2023, we will introduce three new vessels to our fleet, including Royal Caribbean International s new flagship Icon of the Seas , Celebrity Cruises Celebrity Ascent , and Silversea Cruises Silver Nova . Each of these vessels will represent the latest hardware for their respective brands and both Icon of the Seas and Silver Nova are the first vessels of a new class. For Royal Caribbean International, new features on Icon of the Seas include a dedicated family neighborhood called Surfside , a pool deck featuring the largest swimming pool and waterpark at sea, and the Aquadome showcasing the tallest waterfall at sea in an 82-foot-tall dome. For Celebrity Cruises, Celebrity Ascent will represent an evolution of Celebrity Beyond and will build on the success that the Edge series of ships has brought to market. For Silversea, Silver Nova will be amongst our most environmentally friendly and energy efficient ships to date. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our Global Brands and Partner Brands have 10 ships on order. Refer to the Operations section below for further information on our ships on order. As we further develop our Newbuild program, we continue to utilize each vessel as an opportunity to pilot new technology towards Destination Net Zero. 
 In addition, we regularly evaluate opportunities to order new ships, purchase existing ships or sell ships in our current fleet while ensuring that we remain focused on the returns we generate on invested capital and maintaining a high level of discipline on capital spending and operating leverage. 
 Markets and itineraries 
 In an effort to penetrate untapped markets, diversify our consumer base and respond to changing economic and geopolitical market conditions, we continue to seek opportunities to deploy ships to new, and stronger markets and itineraries throughout the world. The portability of our ships allows us to deploy our ships to meet demand within our existing and new cruise markets. We make deployment decisions generally 18 to 28 months in advance, with the goal of optimizing the overall profitability of our portfolio. Additionally, the infrastructure investments we have made to create a flexible global sourcing model have made our brands relevant in a number of markets around the world, which allows us to be opportunistic and source the highest yielding guests for our itineraries. 
 Our ships offer a wide selection of itineraries that call on over 1,000 destinations in over 120 countries, spanning across all seven continents. We are focused on maximizing long-term shareholder returns by operating in established 
 
 7 

markets while growing our presence in developing markets. New capacity has allowed our brands to expand into new markets and itineraries in an effort to address changes in market demand. 
 Destination experiences and port facilities 
 In order to provide unique destination experiences to our guests, we have and continue to invest in our private land destinations. In 2018, we announced our Perfect Day Island Collection, an initiative to develop a series of private island destinations around the world. The first island in the collection, Perfect Day at CocoCay, opened in Spring 2019 and includes a wide range of attractions, such as a full water park, zip line course, freshwater pools, helium balloon ride, splash pads and a beach club. In 2023, we plan to expand Perfect Day at CocoCay with the delivery of Hideaway Beach, an elevated, adults-only experience. Additionally, we are planning to introduce a new product, our Royal Beach Club offering, which will offer an exclusive and branded experience at high volume ports. As a result of the operational disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we delayed previously announced Perfect Day site openings and are reassessing their timing as well as the timing of our Royal Beach Club offering portfolio. We continue to evaluate opportunities to develop additional destinations across the globe. 
 In an effort to secure desirable berthing facilities for our ships, and to provide new or enhanced cruise destinations for our guests, we have actively assisted or invested in the development or enhancement of certain port facilities and infrastructure, including mixed-use commercial properties, located in strategic ports of call, and reduction of our environmental impacts. For instance, in November 2022, we opened in Galveston, Texas our new Net Zero homeport cruise terminal, the first cruise terminal facility to generate 100 of its needed energy through on-site solar panels. 
 Generally, we collaborate with local, private or governmental entities by providing management and/or financial assistance and often enter into long-term port usage arrangements. Our participation in these efforts is most often accomplished via investments with the relevant government authority and/or various other strategic partnerships established to develop and/or operate the port facilities, by providing direct development and management expertise or in certain limited circumstances, by providing direct or indirect financial support. In exchange for our involvement, we generally secure preferential berthing rights for our ships. 
 Technological capabilities 
 Technology is a pervasive part of virtually every business process we use to support our operating strategies and provide a quality experience to our customers before, during and after their cruise. Technology also plays a critical role in the measures and protocols that we have developed and will continue operating on our cruise ships. For example, through the deployment of our innovative electronic safety drill ("Muster 2.0") program, we have added convenience, and improved our guests experience regarding the mandatory safety briefing. 
 We have continued to integrate digital capabilities into our operations and have increased our focus in bringing in data analytics and artificial intelligence into our processes to provide better insights on how to model our maintenance or operational actions. Also, we continue to develop tools to enhance our guests' digital experience and grow onboard revenue, by making it easier for our guests to plan and maximize their next vacation through our websites and apps. At the same time, we partnered with SpaceX to launch Starlink, the next generation in shipboard connectivity, unlocking an improved guest experience. In concert with our destination focus, our island technology solutions are now enabling our guests to remain connected with WiFi access, order food and beverages as well as take advantage of all the island based activities with the same ease as onboard our ships. 
 Investments in our core platforms, as well as the trade and direct distribution channels, are delivering the benefit of more modernized solutions with scalability and faster self-service response times while also deploying new features such as flight packages and additional promotional offer capabilities. 
 Cyber security and data privacy are an ongoing focus, and we have made and will continue to make investments to protect our customer data, intellectual property and global operations. 
 Travel advisor support, consumer outreach, and e-commerce 
 Travel advisors continue to be a significant sourcing channel of revenues for our ships. We believe in the value of this distribution channel and invest in maintaining strong relationships with our travel partners. To accomplish this goal, we seek to maintain competitive commission rates and incentive structures with the marketplace. We continuously work with travel advisors to sell upgrades and add-ons such as air and pre-cruise purchases to improve the retention and profitability 
 
 8 

of the channel. We provide brand dedicated sales representatives who serve as consultants to our travel partners. We also provide trained customer service representatives, call centers and online training tools. 
 We continue to operate our Consumer Outreach department, which provides consumers 24-hour access to our vacation planners and customer service agents in our call centers, as well as invest in our websites, including mobile applications and mobile websites. We enable our guests to communicate and book with us through various channels such as phone, web, chat, text message, and/or email. Additionally, we continue to advance our e-commerce capabilities and the vacation shopping experience for our guests. In addition to offering a simplified booking experience, we leverage the mobile application for onboard experiences such as WiFi, beverages, shore excursions, and specialty dining enabling guests to book their vacation end-to-end. 
 
 Guest Services 
 We offer to handle virtually all travel aspects related to guest reservations and transportation, including facilitating guest pre- and post-hotel stay arrangements and air transportation. 
 Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises offer recognition and status upgrades to their guests through their loyalty programs, Crown Anchor Society, Captain s Club, and Venetian Society, respectively, to encourage repeat business. Crown Anchor Society has approximately 17.8 million members worldwide. Captain s Club and Venetian Society have approximately 5.4 million members combined worldwide. Members are awarded points or credits in proportion to the number of cruise days and stateroom category. The loyalty programs provide tiers of membership benefits which entitle guests to upgraded experiences and recognition relative to the status achieved once the guests have accumulated the number of cruise points or credits specified for each tier. In addition, upon achieving a certain level of cruise points or credits, the Crown Anchor Society and Captain s Club members benefit from reciprocal membership benefits between the loyalty programs. Examples of the benefits available under our loyalty programs include, but are not limited to, priority ship embarkation, priority waitlist for shore excursions, complimentary laundry service, complimentary internet, digital discount vouchers, upgraded bathroom amenities, private seating on the pool deck, ship tours and, in the case of our most loyal guests who have achieved the highest levels of cruise points or credits, complimentary cruises. We regularly work to enhance each of our loyalty programs by adding new features and amenities in order to reward our repeat guests.

 In addition, we have an agreement in place with Chantiers de l Atlantique to build an additional Edge-class ship for delivery in 2025, which is contingent upon completion of conditions precedent and financing. 
 Seasonality 
 Our revenues have historically been seasonal based on the demand for cruises. Demand is typically strongest for cruises during the Northern Hemisphere s summer months and holidays. In order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the Northern Hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the Southern Hemisphere, our brands have focused on deployment in the Caribbean, Asia and Australia during that period. 
 Passengers and Capacity 
 Selected statistical information is shown in the following table (see Financial Presentation - Description of Certain Line Items and Selected Operational and Financial Metrics under Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , for definitions). Passengers Carried, Passenger Cruise Days, Available Passenger Cruise Days and Occupancy reflect the impact of our suspension of operations during parts of 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the gradual resumption of full operations starting the second half of 2021 through the first half of 2022:

(1) Due to the elimination of the Silversea Cruises three-month reporting lag in October of 2021, we include Silversea Cruises' metrics from October 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021 and October 1 through December 31, 2021 in the year ended December 31, 2021. The year ended December 31, 2021 does not include July, August, and September 2021 statistics as Silversea Cruises' results of operations for those months are included within Other (expense) income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 1 . General to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on the three-month reporting lag. 
 (2) Due to the three-month reporting lag effective through September 30, 2021, we include Silversea Cruises' metrics from October 1, 2019 through September 30, 2020 in the year ended December 31, 2020, from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019 in the year ended December 31, 2019, and from August 1, 2018 through September 30, 2018 in the year ended December 31, 2018. 
 (3) For the year ended December, 31, 2021, we include Azamara Cruises' metrics through March 19, 2021, the effective sale date of the brand. Refer to Note 1 . General to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on the sale of the Azamara Cruises brand. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we include the full year of operations for Azamara Cruises. 
 Cruise Pricing 
 Our cruise ticket prices include accommodations and a wide variety of activities and amenities, including meals and entertainment. Prices vary depending on many factors including the destination, cruise length, stateroom category selected and the time of year the cruise takes place. 
 Although we grant credit terms in select markets mainly outside of the United States, our payment terms generally require an upfront deposit to confirm a reservation, with the balance due prior to the sailing. Our cruises are generally available for sale at least one year in advance and often more than two years in advance of sailing. During the selling period of a cruise, we continually monitor and adjust our cruise ticket prices for available guest staterooms based on demand, with the objective of maximizing net yields. 
 As our business has grown globally, our sale arrangements with travel advisors may vary. For instance, although our direct business has historically grown at a rapid pace, sale arrangements through travel advisor charter and group sales are proportionately higher in the China market than in our other markets which are primarily through retail agency and direct sales. 
 We have developed and implemented enhancements to our reservations system that provide us and our travel partners with additional capabilities, making it easier to do business with us. For example, we offer air transportation to our guests through our air transportation program available in major cities around the world. 
 Passenger ticket revenues accounted for approximately 66 , 61 and 68 of total revenues in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 Onboard Activities and Other Revenues 
 Our cruise brands offer modern fleets with a wide array of onboard services, amenities and activities which vary by brand and ship. While many onboard activities are included in the base price of a cruise, we realize additional revenues from, among other things, gaming, the sale of alcoholic and other beverages, internet and other telecommunication services, gift shop items, shore excursions, photography, spa/salon and fitness services, art auctions, retail shops and a wide variety of specialty restaurants and dining options. Many of these services are available for pre-booking prior to embarkation. These activities are offered either directly by us or by independent concessionaires from which we receive a percentage of their revenues. The all-inclusive pricing programs that we offer currently, add some of these onboard activity and other services to the base price of the cruise. 
 In conjunction with our cruise vacations, we offer pre- and post-cruise hotel packages to our Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises guests. We also offer cruise vacation protection coverage to guests in a number of markets, which provides guests with coverage for trip cancellation, medical protection and baggage protection. Onboard and other revenues accounted for approximately 34 , 39 , and 32 of total revenues in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. 
 
 Segment Reporting 
 We believe our brands possess the versatility to enter multiple cruise market segments within the cruise vacation industry. Although each of our brands has its own marketing style as well as ships and crews of various sizes, the nature of the products sold and services delivered by our brands share a common base (i.e., the sale and provision of cruise vacations). Our brands also have similar itineraries as well as similar cost and revenue components. In addition, our Global 
 
 13 

Brands have historically sourced passengers from similar markets around the world and operated in similar economic environments with a significant degree of commercial overlap. As a result, our brands have been aggregated as a single reportable segment based on the similarity of their economic characteristics, types of consumers, regulatory environment, maintenance requirements, supporting systems and processes as well as products and services provided. Our President and Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the chief operating decision-maker and all significant operating decisions including the allocation of resources are based upon the analyses of the Company as one segment. For financial information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data .) 
 
 Human Capital 
 Our human capital strategy focuses on attracting, developing and retaining the best talent in the industry. Some key elements of these strategies include: assessing current and future talent needs; a diverse and inclusive workforce; robust opportunities for employee growth and development; support for health and well-being; and an active listening strategy to make sure voices are heard and continuous improvement occurs. We review our human capital metrics and our diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) program with the Talent and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors on a regular basis. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our three global cruise brands employed approximately 102,500 employees spanning across our shipboard fleet and shoreside locations. Our shoreside workforce, including private destinations, consisted of approximately 8,100 full time and 100 part-time employees. Our shipboard workforce consisted of 94,300 employees, and as of December 31, 2022, approximately 88 were covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
 The following table details the distribution of our workforce by employee type and region as of December 31, 2022: 
 Employee Type U.S. Based Employees International Employees Shoreside Operations (1) 
 4,100 3,000 Shipboard Employees 94,300 Private Destinations (2) 
 1,100 
 
 (1) Includes full time and part-time employees. 
 (2) Private Destinations includes Coco Cay, Labadee and Galapagos based employees. 
 
 As a global operation, we take great pride in the broad diversity of our workforce and the value it brings to our company. Our shoreside workforce is gender diverse with 58 female representation. Our shipboard workforce is comprised of employees from approximately 139 countries. The majority of our shipboard workforce comes from the Philippines (30 ), Indonesia (18 and India (14 ). Our shoreside workforce is primarily based out of the U.S. (57 ), Philippines (21 ), Mexico (7 ), and U.K. (5 ). 
 The following table details the gender distribution of our workforce by employee location as of December 31, 2022:

 (1) No other individual category is greater than 1 . 
 We offer a variety of learning and development programs to our workforce, which includes a combination of instructor led (classroom and virtual) and web based (self-learning) courses. In 2022, our workforce invested approximately 2.5 million hours in learning programs across a variety of areas ranging from Ethics, Compliance, Data Analysis, Business Software and Tools, Finance/Accounting, Professional development, Project Management skills, Cyber Security, Leadership and Safety/Security. In total, our workforce completed approximately 1.2 million courses within our learning management systems. 
 We run our employee pulse surveys periodically to understand and positively impact our employees experience. In 2022, our shoreside employee engagement scores remained high and above most global industry benchmarks. 
 
 Insurance 
 We maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships, with insured values generally equal to the net book value of each ship. This coverage is maintained with reputable insurance underwriters from the British, Scandinavian, French, United States and other reputable international insurance markets. 
 We are members of four Protection and Indemnity ("P I") clubs, which are part of a worldwide group of 12 P I clubs, known as the International Group of P I Clubs (the IG ). Liabilities, costs and expenses for illness and injury to crew, guest injury, pollution and other third-party claims in connection with our cruise activities are covered by our P I clubs, subject to the clubs rules and the limits of coverage determined by the IG. P I coverage provided by the clubs is on a mutual basis and we are subject to additional premium calls in the event of a catastrophic loss incurred by any member of the 12 P I clubs, whereby the reinsurance limits purchased by the IG are exhausted. We are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment and underwriting shortfalls experienced by our own individual insurers. 
 We maintain war risk insurance for legal liability to crew, guests and other third parties as well as for loss or damage to our vessels arising from acts of war, including invasion, insurrection, terrorism, rebellion, piracy and hijacking. Our primary war risk coverage is provided by a Norwegian war risk insurance association and our excess war risk insurance is provided by our four P I clubs. Consistent with most marine war risk policies, our coverage is subject to cancellation in the event of a change in risk. In the event of a war between major powers, our primary policies terminate after thirty days notice and our excess policies terminate immediately. Our excess policies are also subject to cancellation after a notice period of seven days in the event of other changes in risk. These notice periods allow for premiums to be renegotiated based on changes in risk. 
 Insurance coverage for other exposures, such as shoreside property and casualty, passenger off-vessel, directors and officers and network security and privacy, are maintained with various global insurance companies. 
 We do not carry business interruption insurance for our ships based on our evaluation of the risks involved and protective measures already in place, as compared to the cost of insurance. 
 All insurance coverage is subject to certain limitations, exclusions and deductible levels. In addition, in certain circumstances, we either self-insure or co-insure a portion of these risks. Premiums charged by insurance carriers, including carriers in the maritime insurance industry, increase or decrease from time to time and tend to be cyclical in nature. These cycles are impacted both by our own loss experience and by losses incurred in direct and reinsurance markets. We historically have been able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts and at premiums we have deemed to be commercially acceptable. No assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to us in the future, particularly for war risk insurance.

Trademarks 
 We own a number of registered trademarks related to the Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises cruise brands. The registered trademarks include the name Royal Caribbean International and its crown and anchor logo, the name Celebrity Cruises and its X logo, the name Silversea Cruises and its logo, and the names of various cruise ships, ship venues and other marketing programs. We believe our largest brands' trademarks are widely recognized throughout the world and have considerable value. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. 
 
 Regulation 
 Our ships are regulated by various international, national, state and local laws, regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they operate. In addition, our ships are registered in the Bahamas, Cyprus, Malta or in the case of our ships operating in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador. Each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry, including regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of our ships, guests and crew as well as environmental protection. Each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations as discussed more fully below. Ships operating out of ports of call around the world are also subject to inspection by the maritime authorities of that country for compliance with international treaties and local regulations. Additionally, ships operating out of the United States ports are subject to inspection by the United States Coast Guard for compliance with international treaties and by the United States Public Health Service for sanitary and health conditions. Our ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and regulations of various other countries our ships visit. 
 We believe that we are in material compliance with all the regulations applicable to our ships and that we have all licenses necessary to conduct our business. Health, safety, security, environmental and financial responsibility issues are, and we believe will continue to be, an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in the United States and internationally. From time to time, various regulatory and legislative changes may be implemented that could impact our operations and subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future. 
 Safety and Security Regulations 
 Our ships are required to comply with international safety standards defined in the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea SOLAS ), which, among other things, establish requirements for ship design, structural features, materials, construction, lifesaving equipment and safe management and operation of ships for guest and crew safety. The SOLAS standards are revised from time to time and incorporated in our ship design and operation, as applicable. The latest enhancements include the addition of the Polar Code which sets goal-based standards for ships operating in the polar region as well as damage stability requirements for new designs and operational measures for existing vessels. Compliance with these modified standards have not historically had a material effect on our operating costs. SOLAS incorporates the International Safety Management Code ISM Code ), which provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention. The ISM Code is mandatory for all vessels, including passenger vessel operators. 
 All of our operations and ships are regularly audited by various national authorities, and we are required to maintain the relevant certificates of compliance with the ISM Code. 
 Additionally, we are required to meet, and we fully comply with, the provisions outlined in the Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW). This convention sets the training and competency standards for all our crew who are responsible for operating the vessels or who have designated roles in ensuring the safety of our guests and crew during an emergency. Regulatory bodies routinely check that our crews training credentials are up-to-date and assess competency by observing safety and emergency drills. As amendments are made to STCW, we ensure that our crew training is updated accordingly. 
 Our ships are subject to various security requirements, including the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code ISPS Code ), which is part of SOLAS, and the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 MTSA ), which applies to ships that operate in U.S. ports. In order to satisfy these security requirements, we implement security measures, conduct vessel security assessments, and develop security plans. The security plans for all of our ships have been submitted to and approved by the Recognized Security Organization on behalf of the ships' flag state and are in compliance with the ISPS Code and the MTSA. 
 The Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act of 2010, which applies to passenger vessels which embark or include port stops within the United States, requires the implementation of certain safety design features as well as the establishment of 
 
 16 

practices for the reporting of and dealing with allegations of crime. The cruise industry supported this legislation and we believe that our internal standards are generally as strict or stricter than the law requires. Some provisions of the act call for regulations which have not been finalized. We do not expect the pending regulations to have a material impact to our operations. 
 Environmental Regulations 
 We are subject to various international and national laws and regulations relating to environmental protection. Under such laws and regulations, we are generally prohibited from discharging materials other than food waste into the waterways. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. From time to time, environmental and other regulators consider more stringent regulations, which may affect our operations and increase our compliance costs. We believe that the impact of ships on the global environment will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world and, accordingly, may subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future, including the items described below. 
 Our ships are subject to the International Maritime Organization s IMO regulations under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (the MARPOL Regulations and the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships Ballast Water and Sediments (Ballast Water Management Convention), in addition to other regional and national regulations such as EU Directives and the US Vessel General Permit, which includes requirements designed to minimize pollution by oil, sewage, garbage, air emissions and the transfer of non-native/non-indigenous species. We have obtained the relevant international compliance certificates relating to oil, sewage, air pollution prevention and ballast water for all of our ships. 
 Emissions 
 The MARPOL Regulations imposed reduced global limitations on the sulfur content of emissions emitted by ships operating worldwide to 0.5 as of January 1, 2020, which was reduced from 3.5 . We do not expect for this increased limitation to have a material impact to our results of operations largely due to a number of mitigating steps we have taken over the last several years, including equipping all of our new ships delivered since 2014 with Advanced Emissions Purification ("AEP") systems covering all engines and actively developing and installing AEP systems on the majority of our remaining fleet; resulting in 70 of our fleet being equipped with AEP systems. In addition, the majority of our ships on order are being delivered with Liquified Natural Gas ("LNG") technology that meet all sulfur requirements. These efforts will provide us with additional operational and deployment flexibility. 
 The MARPOL Regulations also establish special Emission Control Areas ("ECAs") with additional stringent limitations on sulfur emissions in certain geographical areas. There are four established ECAs and one additional ECA being established beginning in May of 2025 that restrict sulfur emissions: the Baltic Sea, the North Sea/English Channel, certain waters surrounding the North American coast, and the waters surrounding Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (the "Caribbean ECA") and the Mediterranean Sea. Ships operating in these sulfur ECAs are required to reduce their emissions sulfur content to 0.1 . This reduction has not, and with the addition of the new ECA will not, have a significant impact on our results of operations to date due to the mitigating steps described above. 
 Additionally, all new ships operating within the North American and U.S. Caribbean Sea ECA that began construction on or after January 1, 2016, and North and Baltic Sea ships constructed on or after January 1, 2021 are required to meet more stringent nitrogen oxide emission limits. We comply with these rules for those relevant ships in service. As an added measure, all of our ships under construction are being built to comply with these rules. The rules have not had and are not expected to have a significant impact to our operations or costs. 
 Beginning in 2018 and 2019, respectively, the European Union (EU) and IMO both implemented requirements for ships to monitor and report their carbon emissions. Compliance with these regulations have not materially impacted our costs or results of operations. However, the legislations contemplate the enactment of further obligations and restrictions focused on reducing carbon emissions from ships. The EU has proposed a series of significant carbon reforms under its Fit for 55 package designed to meet its 2030 emission goals, which would require us, among other things, to increase the use of low carbon fuel onboard our vessels, connectivity to shore power, and to purchase carbon allowances. The Fit for 55 Package includes proposals for the EU Emission Trading System (ETS), and the FuelEU Maritime initiative. The ETS s current proposed structure will subject ship operators to the program, and will impose requirements to purchase carbon emission allowances beginning in 2024 for 40 of our emissions within Europe, growing to 70 in 2025, and to 100 by 2026. The FuelEU Maritime initiative, still under development, currently proposes requirements on fuel mix of 2-6 lower carbon fuels beginning in 2024 to 2026 and connecting to shore power by 2030. If enacted, the Fit for 55 proposals could individually and collectively have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations due to increased costs 
 
 17 

associated with compliance and modified itineraries in the affected regions. The impact of the regulation is uncertain as elements of the proposals have not been finalized and the costs of ETS allowances will depend on future markets. 
 In November of 2020, IMO approved amendments to the MARPOL convention that will require ships, beginning in 2023, to combine a technical and an operational approach (Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index ("EEXI") and Carbon Intensity Indicator ("CII")) to reduce their carbon intensity in line with the ambition of the Initial IMO GHG Strategy, which aims to reduce carbon intensity of international shipping by 40 by 2030 as compared to 2008. The approved framework for the EEXI and CII amendments are not expected to have a material impact on our operations, however IMO is expected to review the CII framework in 2026, which could result in further requirements which could lead to changes to our itinerary flexibility for some of our ships depending on the final operational measures needed to comply. Furthermore, the IMO is also considering various other measures, including a possible fuel standard or a global market-based measures, such as carbon taxes, that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions even further. While the exact impact is uncertain at this time as the proposals have yet to be finalized, the global nature of the regulation could result in increased compliance costs. We will continue to monitor and be engaged in the discussions. 
 Ballast Water 
 The IMO Ballast Water Management Convention, which came into effect in 2017, requires ships that carry and discharge ballast water to meet specific discharge standards by installing Ballast Water Treatment Systems by 2023. Compliance with this regulation has not had a material effect on our results of operations and we do not expect the continuing compliance with this regulation to have a material effect on our results of operations. 
 Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - "Environmental, labor, health and safety, financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase costs" for further discussion of the risks associated with the regulations discussed above . 
 Consumer Financial Responsibility Regulations 
 We are required to obtain certificates from the United States Federal Maritime Commission relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of non-performance of obligations to guests, as well as casualty and personal injury. As a condition to obtaining the required certificates, we generally arrange through our insurers for the provision of surety for our ship-operating companies. The required amount of the surety bonds for non-performance of obligations to guests is currently 32 million per operator and is subject to additional consumer price index based adjustments. 
 We are also required by the United Kingdom, Norway, Finland, Iceland and the Baltics to establish our financial responsibility for any liability resulting from the non-performance of our obligations to guests from these jurisdictions. In the United Kingdom we are currently required by the Association of British Travel Agents to provide performance bonds in varying amounts during the course of the year, up to 154 million during the peak season. Additionally, we are required by the Civil Aviation Authority to provide performance bonds totaling 35 million. We maintain with the Norwegian Travel Guarantee Fund performance bonds in varying amounts during the course of the year to cover our financial responsibility in Norway, Finland, Iceland and the Baltics. 
 Certain other jurisdictions also require that we establish financial responsibility to our guests resulting from the non-performance of our obligations; however, the related amounts do not have a material effect on our costs. 
 
 Taxation of the Company 
 The following is a summary of our principal taxes, exemptions and special regimes. In addition to or instead of income taxation, virtually all jurisdictions where our ships call impose some tax or fee, or both, based on guest headcount, tonnage or some other measure. We also collect and remit value added tax (VAT) or sales tax in many jurisdictions where we operate. 
 Our consolidated operations are primarily foreign corporations engaged in the owning and operating of passenger cruise ships in international transportation. 
 U.S. Income Taxation 
 The following is a discussion of the application of the U.S. federal and state income tax laws to us and is based on the current provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, Treasury Department regulations, administrative rulings, court decisions and the relevant state tax laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions of the states where we have business operations. All of the foregoing is subject to change, and any such change could affect the accuracy of this discussion.

Application of Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code 
 Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., Celebrity Cruises, Inc. and Silversea Cruises Ltd. are engaged in a trade or business in the United States, and many of our ship-owning subsidiaries, depending upon the itineraries of their ships, receive income from sources within the United States. Silversea Cruises Ltd. and our United Kingdom tonnage tax company are classified as disregarded entities, or divisions for U.S. federal income tax purposes that may earn U.S. source income. Under Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code, certain foreign corporations may exclude from gross income (and effectively from branch profits tax as such earnings do not give rise to effectively connected earnings and profits) U.S. source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships, including income from the leasing of such ships. 
 A foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of Section 883 if, in relevant part: (1) the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the United States; and (2) the stock of the corporation (or the direct or indirect corporate parent thereof) is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States. In the opinion of our U.S. tax counsel, Faegre Drinker Biddle Reath LLP, based on the representations and assumptions set forth in that opinion, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., including Silversea Cruises Ltd., Celebrity Cruises Inc., and relevant ship-owning subsidiaries with U.S. source shipping income qualify for the benefits of Section 883 because Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and each of those subsidiaries are incorporated in Liberia, which is a qualifying country, and our common stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States (i.e., we are a publicly traded corporation). If, in the future, (1) Liberia no longer qualifies as an equivalent exemption jurisdiction, and we do not reincorporate in a jurisdiction that does qualify for the exemption, or (2) we fail to qualify as a publicly traded corporation, we and all of our ship-owning or operating subsidiaries that rely on Section 883 to exclude qualifying income from gross income would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on their U.S. source shipping income and income from activities incidental thereto. 
 We believe that most of our income and the income of our ship-owning subsidiaries, is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships and, therefore, is exempt from taxation under Section 883. 
 Regulations under Section 883 list activities that are not considered by the Internal Revenue Service to be incidental to the international operation of ships including the sale of air and land transportation, shore excursions and pre- and post-cruise tours. Our income from these activities that is earned from sources within the United States will be subject to U.S. taxation. 
 Taxation in the Absence of an Exemption Under Section 883 
 If Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., the operator of our vessels, Celebrity Cruises Inc., or our ship-owning subsidiaries were to fail to meet the requirements of Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code, or if the provision was repealed, then, as explained below, such companies would be subject to U.S. income taxation on a portion of their income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships. 
 Because Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Celebrity Cruises Inc. conduct a trade or business in the United States, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., including Silversea Cruises Ltd., and Celebrity Cruises Inc. would be taxable at regular corporate rates on our separate company taxable income (i.e., without regard to the income of our ship-owning subsidiaries) on income which is effectively connected with our U.S. trade or business (generally only income from U.S. sources). In addition, if any of our earnings and profits effectively connected with our U.S. trade or business were withdrawn, or were deemed to have been withdrawn, from our U.S. trade or business, those withdrawn amounts would be subject to a branch profits tax at the rate of 30 . Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., which includes Silversea Cruises Ltd. for tax purposes, and Celebrity Cruises Inc. would also be potentially subject to tax on portions of certain interest paid by us at rates of up to 30 . 
 If Section 883 were not available to our ship-owning subsidiaries, each such subsidiary would be subject to a special 4 tax on its U.S. source gross transportation income, if any, each year because it does not have a fixed place of business in the United States and its income is derived from the leasing of a ship. 
 Other United States Taxation 
 Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., which includes Silversea Cruises Ltd., and Celebrity Cruises Inc. earn U.S. source income from activities not considered incidental to international shipping. The tax on such income is not material to our results of operation for all years presented. 

19 

State Taxation 
 Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., Celebrity Cruises Inc., and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various U.S. state income taxes which are generally imposed on each state s portion of the U.S. source income subject to federal income taxes. Additionally, the state of Alaska subjects an allocated portion of the total income of companies doing business in Alaska and certain other affiliated companies to Alaska corporate state income taxes and also imposes a 33 tax on adjusted gross income from onboard gambling activities conducted in Alaska waters. This did not have a material impact to our results of operations for all years presented. 
 United Kingdom Income Taxation 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we operated 15 ships under the United Kingdom tonnage tax regime U.K. tonnage tax ). 
 Companies subject to U.K. tonnage tax pay a corporate tax on a notional profit determined with reference to the net tonnage of qualifying vessels. The requirements for a company to qualify for the U.K. tonnage tax regime include being subject to U.K. corporate income tax, operating qualifying ships, which are strategically and commercially managed in the United Kingdom, and fulfilling a seafarer training requirement. 
 Relevant shipping profits include income from the operation of qualifying ships and from shipping related activities. Our U.K. income from non-shipping activities which do not qualify under the U.K. tonnage tax regime and which are not considered significant, remain subject to regular U.K. corporate income tax. 
 Other Taxation 
 We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to value-added and other indirect taxes most of which are reclaimable, zero-rated or exempt. 
 In December 2022, the European Union announced it would implement the Organization for Economic Co-operation Development s (OECD s) 15 Global Minimum Tax initiative (known as Pillar 2 ). If enacted, these rules generally impose a 15 corporate minimum tax on large multi-national companies, and we expect to be in scope of the rules beginning in 2025. The OECD model rules provide an exclusion for International Shipping Income, and certain ancillary income, for which certain of our earnings may be eligible. We are still pending final guidance on several material open technical issues and assessing the impact on our financial statements.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 The risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historical results. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks. There may be additional risks that we consider not to be material, or which are not known, and any of these risks could affect our operations. The ordering of the risk factors set forth below is not intended to reflect a risk's potential likelihood or magnitude. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements. 
 Macroeconomic, Business, Market and Operational Risks 
 Adverse economic or other conditions could reduce the demand for cruises and passenger spending, adversely impacting our operating results, cash flows and financial condition including impairing the value of our goodwill, ships, trademarks and other assets and potentially affecting other critical accounting estimates where the impact may be material to our operating results. 
 Demand for cruises is affected by international, national, and local economic conditions. Weak or uncertain economic conditions may impact consumer confidence and pose a risk as vacationers postpone or reduce discretionary spending. This, in turn, may result in cruise booking slowdowns, decreased cruise prices and lower onboard revenues. Given the global nature of our business, we are exposed to many different economies, and our business could be negatively impacted by challenging conditions in any of the markets in which we operate, and/or related reactions by our competitors in such markets. 
 Our operating costs could increase due to market forces and economic or geopolitical factors beyond our control. 
 Our operating costs, including fuel, food, payroll and benefits, airfare, taxes, insurance, and security costs, can be and have been subject to increases due to market forces and economic or geopolitical conditions or other factors beyond our control, including global inflationary pressures, which have increased our operating costs. Increases in these operating costs have affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our future profitability. 
 In particular, increases in fuel prices have and could continue to materially and adversely affect our business as fuel prices impact not only our fuel costs, but also some of our other expenses, such as crew travel, freight, and commodity prices. Mandatory fuel restrictions may also create uncertainty related to the price and availability of certain fuel types potentially impacting operating costs. 
 Price increases for commercial airline services for our guests or major changes or reduction in commercial airline services and/or availability could adversely impact the demand for cruises and undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages to our guests. 
 Many of our guests depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to or from the ports where our cruises embark or disembark. Increases in the price of airfare would increase the overall price of the cruise vacation to our guests, which may adversely impact demand for our cruises. In addition, changes in the availability and/or regulations governing commercial airline services could adversely affect our guests ability to obtain air travel, as well as our ability to transfer our guests to or from our cruise ships, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Terrorist attacks, war, and other similar events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 
 We are susceptible to a wide range of adverse events, including terrorist attacks, war, conflicts, civil unrest and other hostilities. The occurrence of these events or an escalation in the frequency or severity of them, and the resulting political instability, travel restrictions and advisories and concerns over safety and security aspects of traveling or the fear of any of the foregoing, have had, and could have in the future, a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry. These events could also result in additional security measures taken by local authorities which have, and may in the future, impact access to ports and/or destinations. In addition, such events have led, and could lead, to disruptions, instability and volatility in global markets, supply chains and industries, increased operating costs, such as fuel and food, and disruptions affecting our newbuild construction and fleet modernization efforts, any of which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations. Further, such events could have the effect of heightening the other risks we have described in this report, any of which also could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 Disease outbreaks and an increase in concern about the risk of illness could adversely impact our business and results of operations, and may cause significant disruptions, create new risks, and exacerbate existing risks. 
 Disease outbreaks and increased concern related to illness when traveling to, from, and on our ships such as COVID-19 could cause a drop in demand for cruises, guest cancellations, travel restrictions, an unavailability of ports and/or destinations, cruise cancellations, ship redeployments and an inability to source our crew, provisions or supplies from certain places. In addition, we may be subject to increased concerns that cruises are more susceptible than other vacation alternatives to the spread of infectious diseases. For example, the unprecedented responses by governments and other authorities to control and contain the COVID-19 outbreak, 
 including related variants, led to our voluntary suspension of our global cruise operations starting in March 2020. While we have resumed our global cruise operations, there is no assurance that our cruise operations will continue uninterrupted. In response to disease outbreaks, our industry, including our passengers and crew, may be subject to enhanced health and safety requirements in the future which may be costly and take a significant amount of time to implement across our fleet. For example, local governments may establish their own set of rules for self-quarantines and/or require proof of individuals' health status or vaccination prior to or upon visiting. Based on our assessment of these requirements and recommendations, or for other reasons, we may determine it necessary to cancel or modify certain of our Global Brands cruise sailings. The impact of any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, any operating or health protocols that we may develop or that may be required by law in the future in response to infectious diseases may be costly to develop and implement and may be less effective than we expected in reducing the risk of infection and spread of such disease on our cruise ships, all of which will negatively impact our operations and expose us to reputational and legal risks. 
 Incidents on ships, at port facilities, land destinations and/or affecting the cruise vacation industry in general, and the associated negative media coverage and publicity, have affected and could continue to affect our reputation and impact our sales and results of operations. 
 Cruise ships, private destinations, port facilities and shore excursions operated and/or offered by us and third parties may be susceptible to the risk of accidents, illnesses, mechanical failures, environmental incidents and other incidents which could bring into question safety, health, security and vacation satisfaction and negatively impact our sales, operations and reputation. Incidents involving cruise ships, and, in particular the safety, health and security of guests and crew and the media coverage thereof, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, have impacted and could continue to impact demand for our cruises and pricing in the industry. In particular, we cannot predict the impact on our financial performance and the public s concern regarding the health and safety of travel, especially by cruise ship, and related decreases in demand for travel and cruising. Moreover, our ability to attract and retain guests and crew depends, in part, upon the perception and reputation of our company and our brands and the public s concerns regarding the health and safety of travel generally, as well as regarding the cruising industry and our ships specifically. Our reputation and our business could also be damaged by continued or additional negative publicity regarding the cruise industry in general, including publicity regarding the spread of contagious disease such as COVID-19, over-tourism in key ports and destinations and the potentially adverse environmental impacts of cruising. The considerable expansion in the use of social and digital media has compounded the potential scope and reach of any negative publicity. In addition, incidents involving cruise ships may result in additional costs to our business, increasing government or other regulatory oversight and, in certain cases, potential litigation. 
 Significant weather, climate events and/or natural disasters could adversely impact our business and results of operations. 
 Natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, volcanos, wildfires), weather and/or climate events (including hurricanes and typhoons) could impact our source markets and operations resulting in travel restrictions, guest cancellations, an inability to source our crew or our provisions and supplies from certain places. We are often forced to alter itineraries and occasionally cancel a cruise or a series of cruises or to redeploy our ships due to these types of events, which could have an adverse effect on our sales, operating costs and profitability in the current and future periods. Increases in the frequency, severity or duration of these types of events could exacerbate their impact and disrupt our operations or make certain destinations less desirable or unavailable impacting our revenues and profitability further. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and on industry performance. 
 Our sustainability activities, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, could result in reputational risks, increased costs and other risks. 
 Customers, investors, lenders, regulators and other industry stakeholders have placed increasing importance on corporate ESG practices and on the implications and social cost of their investments, which could cause us to incur additional costs and changes to our operations. If our ESG practices or disclosures do not meet stakeholders' evolving expectations and standards, our customer and employee retention, our access to certain types of capital, including export credit financing, and our brands and reputation may be negatively impacted, which could affect our business operations and financial condition. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report and comply with various ESG practices, which could increase our operating costs and affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 In addition, from time to time, we communicate certain initiatives regarding climate change and other ESG matters. We could fail or be perceived to fail to achieve such initiatives, which may negatively affect our reputation. The future adoption of new technology or processes to achieve the initiatives could also result in the impairment of existing assets. 
 Our reliance on shipyards, their subcontractors and our suppliers to implement our newbuild and ship upgrade programs and to repair and maintain our ships exposes us to risks which could adversely impact our business. 
 We rely on shipyards, their subcontractors and our suppliers to effectively construct our new ships and to repair, maintain, and upgrade our existing ships on a timely basis and in a cost effective manner. There are a limited number of shipyards with the capability 
 and capacity to build, repair, maintain and/or upgrade our ships. As such, any disruptions affecting the newbuild or fleet modernization supply chain will adversely impact our business as there are limited substitutes. 
 Suspensions and/or slowdowns of work at shipyards, have impacted and could continue to impact our ability to construct new ships as planned, our ability to timely and cost-effectively procure new capacity, and our ability to execute scheduled drydocks and/or fleet modernizations. For instance, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the shipyards, their subcontractors, and our suppliers have resulted in delays in our previously scheduled ship deliveries. Variations from our plan could have a significant negative impact on our business operations and financial condition. 
 Building, repairing, maintaining and/or upgrading a ship is sophisticated work that involves significant risks. Material increases in commodity and raw material prices, and other cost pressures impacting the construction of a new ship, such as the cost of labor and financing, could adversely impact the shipyard s ability to build the ship on a cost-effective basis. We may be impacted if shipyards, their subcontractors, and/or our suppliers encounter financial difficulties, supply chain, technical or design problems when building or repairing a ship. These problems have impacted and may in the future impact the timely delivery or cost of new ships or the ability of shipyards to repair and upgrade our fleet in accordance with our needs or expectations. In addition, delays, mechanical faults and/or unforeseen incidents may result in cancellation of cruises or delays of new ship orders or necessitate unscheduled drydocks. Such events could result in lost revenue, increased operating expenses, or both, and thus adversely affect our results of operations. 
 An increase in capacity worldwide or excess capacity in a particular market could adversely impact our cruise sales and/or pricing. 
 Although our ships can be redeployed, cruise sales and/or pricing may be impacted by the introduction of new ships into the marketplace, reductions in cruise capacity, overall market growth and deployment decisions of ourselves and our competitors. As of December 31, 2022, a total of 63 new ships with approximately 143,000 berths were on order for delivery through 2028 in the cruise industry, including 10 ships currently scheduled to be delivered to our Global and Partner Brands. The further net growth in capacity from these new ships and future orders, without an increase in the cruise industry s demand and/or share of the vacation market, could depress cruise prices and impede our ability to achieve yield improvement. 
 In addition, to the extent that we or our competitors deploy ships to a particular itinerary/region and the resulting capacity in that region exceeds the demand, it may negatively affect our pricing and profitability. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including potentially impairing the value of our ships and other assets. 
 Unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our results of operations. 
 We believe that port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation. The availability of ports and destinations is affected by a number of factors, including industry demand and competition for key ports and destinations, existing capacity constraints, constraints related to the size of certain ships, security, financial limitations on port development, exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors, geopolitical developments, local governmental regulations, environmental regulations, and governmental response to disease outbreaks. Higher fuel costs also may adversely impact the destinations on certain of our itineraries as they become too costly to include. 
 In addition, certain ports and destinations have faced a surge of both cruise and non-cruise tourism which, in certain cases, has fueled anti-tourism sentiments and related countermeasures to limit the volume of tourists allowed in these destinations. In certain destinations, countermeasures to limit the volume of tourists have been contemplated and/or put into effect, including proposed limits on cruise ships and cruise passengers, which could limit the itinerary and destination options we can offer our passengers going forward. 
 Increased demand and competition for key ports of call or destinations, limitations on the availability or feasibility of use of specific ports of call and/or constraints on the availability of shore excursions and other service providers at such ports or destinations could adversely affect our operations and financial results. 
 We may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market. 
 We operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation. We, therefore, risk losing business not only to other cruise lines, but also to other vacation operators, which provide other leisure options, including hotels, resorts, internet-based alternative lodging sites and package holidays and tours. 
 We face significant competition from other cruise lines on the basis of cruise pricing, travel advisor preference and also in terms of the nature of ships, services and destinations that we offer to guests. Our revenues are sensitive to the actions of other cruise lines in many areas including pricing, scheduling, capacity and promotions, which can have a substantial adverse impact not only on our revenues, but also on overall industry revenues. 
 In the event that we do not effectively market or differentiate our cruise brands from our competitors or otherwise compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and new or existing cruise companies, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. 
 If we are unable to appropriately manage our cost and capital allocation strategies with our goal of satisfying guest expectations, it may adversely impact our business success. 
 We strive to provide high quality products and deliver high quality services. There can be no assurance that we can successfully balance these goals with our cost management and capital allocation strategies. Our business also requires us to make capital allocation decisions across a broad scope of investment options with varying return profiles and time horizons for value realization. These include significant capital investment decisions such as ordering new ships, upgrading our existing fleet, enhancing our technology and/or data capabilities and expanding our portfolio of land-based assets, based on expected market preferences, competition and projected demand. There can be no assurance that our strategies will be successful, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, our ownership and operation of older tonnage, in particular during the business disruption caused by COVID-19, has resulted in impaired asset values due to expected returns less than the carrying value of the assets. 
 Our attempts to expand our business into new markets and new ventures may not be successful. 
 We opportunistically seek to grow our business through, among other things, expansion into new destinations or source markets and establishment of new ventures complementary to our current offerings. These attempts to expand our business increase the complexity of our business, require significant levels of investment and can strain our management, personnel, operations and systems. In addition, we may be unable to execute our attempts to expand our business. There can be no assurance that these business expansion efforts will develop as anticipated or that we will succeed, and if we do not, we may be unable to recover our investment, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Risks associated with our development and operation of key land-based destination projects may adversely impact our business or results of operations. 
 We have invested, either directly or indirectly through joint ventures and partnerships, in a growing portfolio of key land-based projects including port and terminal facilities, private destinations and multi-brand destination projects. These investments can increase our exposure to certain key risks depending on the scope, location, and the ownership and management structure of these projects. These risks include susceptibility to weather events, exposure to local political/regulatory developments and policies, logistical challenges and human resource and labor risks and safety, environmental, and health risks, including challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects locally where we have these projects and relationships. 
 Our reliance on travel advisors to sell and market our cruises exposes us to certain risks which could adversely impact our business. 
 We rely on travel advisors to generate bookings for our ships. Accordingly, we must maintain competitive commission rates and incentive structures. If we fail to offer competitive compensation packages or fail to maintain our relationships, these agencies may be incentivized to sell cruises offered by our competitors, which could adversely impact our operating results. Our reliance on third-party sellers is particularly pronounced in certain markets. In addition, the travel advisor community is sensitive to economic conditions that impact discretionary income of consumers. Significant disruptions, such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, or contractions in the industry could reduce the number of travel advisors available for us to market and sell our cruises, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the strength of our recovery from suspended operations could be delayed if we are not aligned and partnered with key travel advisors. 
 Business activities that involve our co-investments with third parties may subject us to additional risks. 
 Partnerships, joint ventures and other business structures involving our co-investments with third parties generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks, including the possibility that other investors in such ventures become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests, policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours. In addition to financial risks, our co-investment activities have also presented managerial and operational risks and expose us to reputational or legal concerns. These or other issues related to our co-investments with third parties could adversely impact our operations or liquidity. Further, due to the arrangements we have in place with our partners in these ventures, we are limited in our ability to control the strategy of these ventures, or their use of capital and other key factors to their results of operation, which could adversely affect our investments and impact our results of operations. 

Past or pending business acquisitions or potential acquisitions that we may decide to pursue in the future carry inherent risks which could adversely impact our financial performance and condition. 
 The Company, from time to time, has engaged in acquisitions and may pursue acquisitions in the future, which are subject to, among other factors, the Company s ability to identify attractive business opportunities and to negotiate favorable terms for such opportunities. Accordingly, the Company cannot make any assurances that potential acquisitions will be completed timely or at all, or that if completed, we would realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions. Acquisitions also carry inherent risks such as, among others: (i) the potential delay or failure of our efforts to successfully integrate business processes and realizing expected synergies; (ii) difficulty in aligning procedures, controls and/or policies; and (iii) future unknown liabilities and costs that may be associated with an acquisition. In addition, acquisitions may adversely impact our liquidity and/or debt levels, and the recognized value of goodwill and other intangible assets can be negatively affected by unforeseen events and/or circumstances, which may result in an impairment charge. Any of the foregoing events could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We rely on supply chain vendors and third-party service providers who are integral to the operations of our businesses. These vendors and service providers may be unable or unwilling to deliver on their commitments or may act in ways that could harm our business. 
 We rely on supply chain vendors to deliver key products to the operations of our businesses around the world. Any event impacting a vendor s ability to deliver goods of the expected quality at the location and time needed could negatively impact our ability to deliver our cruise experience. Events impacting our supply chain could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers or us, including inclement weather, natural disasters, new laws and regulations, labor actions, increased demand, problems in production or distribution, cybersecurity events, and/or disruptions in third-party logistics or transportation systems, including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Any such interruptions to our supply chain could increase our costs and could limit the availability of products critical to our operations. In addition, increased regulation or stakeholder expectations regarding sourcing practices, or supplier conduct that does not meet such standards, could cause our operating costs to increase or result in publicity that negatively affects our reputation. 
 In order to achieve cost and operational efficiencies, we outsource to third-party vendors certain services that are integral to the operations of our global businesses, such as our onboard concessionaires, certain of our call center operations, guest port services, logistics distribution and operation of a large part of our information technology systems. We are subject to the risk that certain decisions are subject to the control of our third-party service providers and that these decisions may adversely affect our activities. A failure to adequately monitor a third-party service provider s compliance with a service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements could result in significant economic and reputational harm to us. There is also a risk the confidentiality, privacy and/or security of data held by third parties or communicated over third-party networks or platforms could become compromised. 
 The potential unavailability of insurance coverage, an inability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or our failure to have coverage in sufficient amounts to cover our incurred losses may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. 
 We seek to maintain appropriate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates. We normally obtain insurance based on the cost of an asset rather than replacement value, and we also elect to self-insure, co-insure, or use deductibles in certain circumstances for certain risks such as loss of use of a ship or other business interruption. The limits of insurance coverage we purchase are based on the availability of the coverage, evaluation of our risk profile and cost of coverage. We do not carry business interruption insurance and accordingly we have no insurance coverage for loss of revenues or earnings from our ships or other operations. Accordingly, we are not protected against all risks and cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred which could result in an unexpected decrease in our revenue and results of operations in the event of an incident 
 We are members of four Protection and Indemnity P I clubs, which are part of a worldwide group of 12 P I clubs, known as the International Group of P I Clubs (the IG ). P I coverage provided by the clubs is on a mutual basis, and we are subject to additional premium calls in the event of a catastrophic loss incurred by any member of the 12 P I clubs, whereby the reinsurance limits purchased by the IG are exhausted. We are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment and underwriting shortfalls experienced by our own individual insurers. 
 We cannot be certain that insurance and reinsurance coverage will be available to us and at commercially reasonable rates in the future or at all or, if available, that it will be sufficient to cover potential claims. Additionally, if we or other insureds sustain significant losses, the result may be higher insurance premiums, cancellation of coverage, or the inability to obtain coverage. Such events could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. 
 Disruptions in our shoreside or shipboard operations or our information systems may adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Our principal executive office and principal shoreside operations are located in Florida, and we have shoreside offices throughout the world. Actual or threatened natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes/typhoons, earthquakes, tornadoes, fires or floods), 
 municipal lockdowns, curfews, quarantines, or similar events in these locations may have a material impact on our business continuity, reputation and results of operations. In addition, substantial or repeated information system failures, computer viruses or cyber attacks impacting our shoreside or shipboard operations could adversely impact our business. We do not generally carry business interruption insurance for our shoreside or shipboard operations or our information systems. As such, any losses or damages incurred by us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 
 Provisions of our Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws and Liberian law could inhibit a change of control and may prevent efforts by our shareholders to change our management. 
 Certain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws and Liberian law may inhibit third parties from effectuating a change of control of the Company without approval from our board of directors which could result in the entrenchment of current management. These include provisions in our Articles of Incorporation that prevent third parties, other than A. Wilhelmsen AS and Cruise Associates and their permitted transferees, from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 4.9 of our outstanding shares without the consent of our board of directors. 
 We may not be able to achieve our fiscal 2025 financial and climate-related performance goals. 
 In November 2022, we announced that we are targeting certain financial and climate-related performance goals for fiscal 2025. Our ability to achieve these goals is dependent on a number of factors, including the other risk factors described in this section. If we are not able to achieve these goals, the price of our common stock and reputation may be negatively affected. 
 Financial Risks 
 We may not be able to obtain sufficient financing or capital for our needs or may not be able to do so on terms that are acceptable or consistent with our expectations. 
 To fund our capital expenditures (including new ship orders), operations and scheduled debt payments, we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations, drawdowns under available credit facilities, the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sale of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets. Any circumstance or event which leads to a decrease in consumer cruise spending, such as worsening global economic conditions or significant incidents impacting the cruise industry, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, negatively affects our operating cash flows. As result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting suspension of our operations, we have experienced credit rating downgrades, which have reduced our ability to incur secured indebtedness by reducing the amount of indebtedness that we are permitted to secure, and may negatively impact our access to, and cost of, debt financing. Additionally, our ability to raise additional financing, whether or not secured, could be limited if our credit rating is further downgraded, and/or if we fail to comply with applicable covenants governing our outstanding indebtedness, and/or if overall financial market conditions worsen. 
 Our ability to access additional funding as and when needed, our ability to timely refinance and/or replace our outstanding debt securities and credit facilities on acceptable terms and our cost of funding will depend upon numerous factors including, but not limited to, the strength of the financial markets, global market conditions, including inflationary pressures, interest rate fluctuations, our recovery and financial performance, the recovery and performance of our industry in general and the size, scope and timing of our financial needs. In addition, even where financing commitments have been secured, significant disruptions in the capital and credit markets could cause our banking and other counterparties to breach their contractual obligations to us or could cause the conditions to the availability of such funding not to be satisfied. This could include failures of banks or other financial service companies to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements or to pay us amounts that may become due or return collateral that is refundable under our interest rate derivative instruments or other agreements. If any of the foregoing occurs for a prolonged period of time it will have a long-term negative impact on our cash flows and our ability to meet our financial obligations. 
 Our substantial debt requires a significant amount of cash to service and could adversely affect our financial condition. 
 We have a substantial amount of debt and significant debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2022, we had total debt of 23.4 billion. Our substantial debt has required us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to service debt and fund repayments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate expenses. 
 Our ability to make future scheduled payments on our debt service obligations or refinance our debt depends on our future operating and financial performance and ability to generate cash. This will be affected by our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond our control, such as the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. If we cannot generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service obligations or fund our other business needs, we may, among other things, need to refinance all or a portion of our debt, obtain additional financing, delay planned capital expenditures or sell assets. We cannot assure that we will be able to generate sufficient cash through any of the foregoing. If we are not able to refinance any of our debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt. 
 Our substantial debt could also result in other negative consequences for us. For example, it could increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which we operate; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, the economy or the industry in which we operate; limit our ability to raise additional debt or equity capital in the future to satisfy our requirements relating to working capital, capital expenditures, development projects, strategic initiatives or other purposes; restrict us from making strategic acquisitions, introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities; limit or restrict our ability to obtain and maintain performance bonds to cover our financial responsibility requirements in various jurisdictions for non-performance of guest travel, casualty and personal injury; make it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt; and increase our exposure to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are (and may in the future be) at a variable rate of interest. 
 Despite our leverage, we may incur more debt, which could adversely affect our business. 
 We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Except for the restrictions under the indentures governing our Secured Notes, our Priority Guaranteed Notes, and certain of our other debt instruments, including our unsecured bank and export credit facilities, we are not restricted under the terms of our debt instruments from incurring additional debt. Although the indentures governing the Secured Notes, the Priority Guaranteed Notes, and certain of our other debt instruments, including our unsecured bank and export credit facilities, contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of debt that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. Additionally, there is no guarantee that financing will be available in the future or that such financing will be available with similar terms or terms that are commercially acceptable to us. As of December 31, 2022, we have commitments for approximately 7.1 billion of debt to finance the purchase of 7 ships on order by our Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises brands, all of which are guaranteed by the export credit agencies in the countries in which the ships are being built. The ultimate size of each facility will depend on the final contract price (including change orders and owner s supply) as well as fluctuations in the EUR/USD exchange rate. Refer to Note 8 . Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information regarding our "Secured Notes" and "Priority Guaranteed Notes". 
 We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities. In addition, if we fail to comply with any of these restrictions, it could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Certain of our debt instruments, including our indentures and our unsecured bank and export credit facilities, limit our flexibility in operating our business. For example, certain of our loan agreements and indentures restrict or limit our and our subsidiaries ability to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; pay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or repurchase capital stock and make other restricted payments; make investments; consummate certain asset sales; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; grant or assume certain liens; and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, both our export credit facilities and our non-export credit facilities contain covenants that require us, among other things, to maintain a minimum liquidity, a specified minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and limit our net debt-to-capital ratio. In addition, our ECA facilities also require us to maintain a minimum stockholders' equity. Refer to Note 8 . Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion on our covenants and existing waivers. 
 All of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. Despite these exceptions and qualifications, we cannot assure you that the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in certain of our debt instruments will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest. Any future indebtedness may include similar or other restrictive terms and we may be required to further encumber our assets. In addition, our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. These include prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If we breach any of these covenants or restrictions, we could be in default under such indebtedness and certain of our other debt instruments, and the relevant debt holders or lenders could elect to declare the debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, if any, immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that debt. If the debt under certain of our debt instruments that we enter into were to be accelerated, our liquid assets may be insufficient to repay in full such indebtedness. Borrowings under other debt instruments that contain cross-default provisions also may be accelerated or become payable on demand. In these circumstances, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness then outstanding. 
 In addition, our ability to maintain our credit facilities may also be impacted by changes in our ownership base. More specifically, we may be required to prepay our non-ECA and ECA facilities if any person acquires ownership of more than 50 of our common stock or, subject to certain exceptions, during any 24-month period, a majority of our board of directors is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of our board of directors on the first day of such period. Our debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a third-party acquisition of greater than 50 of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade, which would require us to offer to repurchase our debt securities in the event of such change of control. 
 If we elect to settle conversions of our convertible notes in shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, conversions of our convertible notes will result in dilution for our existing shareholders. Furthermore, new equity or convertible debt issuances will also result in dilution for our existing shareholders. 
 We have an aggregate principal amount of 1.7 billion in convertible notes outstanding. If note holders elect to convert, the notes will be converted into our shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of common stock and cash, at our discretion. Prior to March 15, 2023, August 15, 2023, and May 15, 2025, our convertible notes issued in June 2020, October 2020, and August 2022, respectively, will be convertible at the option of holders during certain periods only upon satisfaction of certain conditions. Beyond those dates, the convertible notes will be convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding their maturity date. Conversions of our convertible notes into shares of our common stock or a combination of common stock and cash, will result in dilution to our shareholders. Additionally, if we raise additional funds through equity or convertible debt issuances, our shareholders could experience dilution of their ownership interest, and these equity or convertible debt securities could have rights, preferences, and privileges that are superior to that of holders of our common stock. 
 We did not declare quarterly dividends on our common stock in the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. 
 We have not declared a dividend since the first quarter of 2020. We expect that any income received from operations will be devoted to our future operations and recovery. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. In addition, in the event we thereafter declare a dividend, we will need to repay our amounts deferred under the export credit facilities. Payment of dividends would, in any case, depend upon our profitability at the time, cash available for those dividends, and other factors as our board of directors may consider relevant. 
 Increased regulatory oversight, and the phasing out of LIBOR may adversely affect the value of a portion of our indebtedness. 
 The publication of certain LIBOR settings ceased after December 31, 2021, and uncertainty regarding alternative reference rates remains as many market participants await a wider adoption of replacement products prior to the cessation of the remaining USD LIBOR tenors (currently scheduled for June 30, 2023). When LIBOR ceases to exist, the level of interest payments on the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates might be affected if we, the agent, and/or the lenders holding a majority of the outstanding loans or commitments under such indebtedness fail to amend such indebtedness to implement a replacement rate. Regardless, such replacement rate will give due consideration to any evolving or then-existing conventions for similar credit facilities, which may result in different than expected interest payments. 
 Compliance and Regulatory Risks 
 Changes in U.S. or other countries foreign travel policy have affected, and may continue to affect our results of operations. 
 Changes in U.S. and other countries' foreign policy have in the past and could in the future result in the imposition of travel restrictions or travel bans on persons to certain countries or result in the imposition of travel advisories, warnings, rules, regulations or legislation exposing us to penalties or claims of monetary damages. In addition, some countries have adopted restrictions against U.S. travelers, and we currently cannot predict when those restrictions will be eased. The timing and scope of these changes and regulations can be unpredictable, and they could cause us to cancel scheduled sailings, possibly on short notice, or could result in litigation against us. This, in turn, could decrease our revenue, increase our operating costs and otherwise impair our profitability. 
 Factors associated with climate change, including an increasing global regulatory focus, could adversely affect our business. 
 There is increasing global regulatory focus on climate change, greenhouse gas and other emissions. These regulatory efforts,both internationally and in the U.S., are still developing, including the international alignment of such efforts, and we cannot yet determine what the final regulatory programs or their impact will be on our business. However, such climate change-related regulatory activity in the future may adversely affect our business and financial results by requiring us to reduce our emissions, pay for our emissions, modify our itineraries and may increase our exposure, if any, to climate change-related litigation. Such activity may also impact us by increasing our operating costs, including fuel costs. For example, the European Union has proposed a series of significant carbon reforms under its Fit for 55 package designed to meet its 2030 emission goals, which would require us, among other things, to increase the use of low carbon fuel onboard our vessels as well as connectivity to shore power. The proposed legislation also includes updates to the European Union Emission Trading System which would impose requirements to purchase carbon emission allowances beginning in 2024. In addition, the U.S. and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted, or may enact, environmental regulations or policies, such as requiring the use of low sulfur fuels (e.g., IMO Sulfur Limit) or the incoming carbon intensity indicator regulation, that have or could increase our direct cost to operate in certain markets, increase our cost of fuel, limit the supply of compliant fuel, cause us to incur significant expenses to purchase and/or develop new equipment and adversely impact the cruise vacation industry. If enacted, these regulations may individually or collectively have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations due to increased costs associated with compliance and modified itineraries in the affected regions. 
 There has also been growing environmental scrutiny of the environmental impact of the cruise vacation industry, and some environmental groups are advocating for more stringent regulation of ship emissions at berth and at sea. This negative publicity of the cruise industry and any related measures may lead to changes in consumer preferences, such as methods or frequency of travel, which could adversely impact our operations and financial results and subject us to reputational impacts and costs. 
 Labor, health and safety, financial responsibility and other maritime regulations and measures could affect operations and increase operating costs. 
 We are subject to various international, national, state and local laws, regulations and treaties that govern, among other things, discharge from our ships, safety standards applicable to our ships, treatment of disabled persons, health and sanitary standards applicable to our guests, security standards on board our ships and at the ship/port interface areas, and financial responsibilities to our guests. These issues are, and we believe will continue to be, an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world. This could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that could subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future and may increase our exposure, if any, to environmental-related litigation. 
 A change in our tax status under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, or other jurisdictions, may have adverse effects on our results of operations. 
 Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a U.S. trade or business and/or from sources within the U.S. In connection with the year end audit, each year, Faegre Drinker Biddle Reath LLP, our U.S. tax counsel, delivers to us an opinion, based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it, to the effect that this income, to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships, is excluded from gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code. We believe that most of our income (including that of our subsidiaries) is derived from or incidental to the international operation of ships. 
 Our ability to rely on Section 883 could be challenged or could change in the future. Provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, including Section 883, are subject to legislative change at any time. Moreover, changes could occur in the future with respect to the identity, residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders, trading volume or trading frequency of our shares, or relevant foreign tax laws of Liberia or the Bahamas, such that they no longer qualify as equivalent exemption jurisdictions, that could affect our eligibility for the Section 883 exemption. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from U.S. income tax on U.S. source shipping income in the future. If we were not entitled to the benefit of Section 883, we and our subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships, which would reduce our net income. 
 Additionally, portions of our business are operated by companies that are within the United Kingdom tonnage tax regime. Further, some of our operations are conducted in jurisdictions where we rely on tax treaties to provide exemption from taxation. To the extent the United Kingdom tonnage tax laws change or we do not continue to meet the applicable qualification requirements or if tax treaties are changed or revoked, we may be required to pay higher income tax in these jurisdictions, adversely impacting our results of operations. 
 Numerous countries are considering implementation of the OECD s 15 global minimum tax, which may materially impact us. In addition, as budgetary constraints may adversely impact fiscal policy in the jurisdictions in which we operate, we may be subject to changes in our existing tax treatment or other tax reform, as well as increased tax audits. 
 We are not a U.S. corporation and, as a result, our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests. 
 Our corporate affairs are governed by our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws and by the Business Corporation Act of Liberia. The provisions of the Business Corporation Act of Liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the U.S. However, there are very few judicial cases in Liberia interpreting the Business Corporation Act of Liberia. While the Business Corporation Act of Liberia provides that it is to be applied and construed to make the laws of Liberia, with respect of the subject matter of the Business Corporation Act of Liberia, uniform with the laws of the State of Delaware and other states with substantially similar legislative provisions (and adopts their case law to the extent it is non-conflicting), there have been few Liberian court cases interpreting the Business Corporation Act of Liberia, and we cannot predict whether Liberian courts would reach the same conclusions as United States courts. We understand that legislation has been proposed but not yet adopted by the Liberian legislature which amends the provisions regarding the adoption of non-Liberian law to, among other things, provide for the adoption of the statutory and case law of Delaware and not also states with substantially similar legislative provisions, and potentially provide the courts of Liberia discretion in application of non-statutory corporation law of Delaware in cases when the laws of Liberia are silent. The right of shareholders to bring a derivative action in Liberian courts may be more limited than in U.S. jurisdictions. There may also be practical difficulties for shareholders attempting to bring suit in Liberia, and Liberian courts may or may not recognize and enforce foreign judgments. Thus, our shareholders may have more difficulty challenging actions taken by management, directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a U.S. jurisdiction. 
 General Risk Factors 
 Conducting business globally results in increased costs and other risks. 
 We operate our business globally, which exposes us to a number of risks, including increased exposure to a wider range of regional and local economic conditions, volatile local political conditions, potential changes in duties and taxes, including changing and/or uncertain interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations, required compliance with additional laws and policies affecting cruising, vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreign-based companies, currency fluctuations, interest rate movements, difficulties in operating under local business environments, port quality and availability in certain regions, U.S. and global anti-bribery laws and regulations, imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings. 
 Our future growth strategies increasingly depend on the growth and sustained profitability of international markets. Factors that will be critical to our success in these markets include our ability to continue to raise awareness of our products and our ability to adapt our offerings to best suit rapidly evolving consumer demands. The execution of our planned growth strategies is dependent on meeting the governmental and regulatory measures and policies in each of these markets. Our ability to realize our future growth strategy is highly dependent on our ability to satisfy country-specific policies and requirements in order to return to service, as well as meet the needs of region-specific consumer preferences as services come back online. These factors may cause us to reevaluate some of our international business strategies. 
 Operating globally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal, regulatory and tax requirements. In many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate, practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards. We cannot guarantee consistent interpretation, application, and enforcement of newly issued rules and regulations, which could place limits on our operations or increase our costs, as well as negatively impact our future growth strategies in our key growth markets. We must adhere to policies designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance as well as applicable laws and regulations. However, we might not be successful in ensuring that our employees, agents, representatives and other third parties with whom we associate properly adhere to applicable laws and regulations. In addition, we may be exposed to the risk of penalties and other liabilities if we fail to comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Failure by us, our employees or any of these third parties to adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations could result in penalties, sanctions, damage to our reputation and related costs, which in turn could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows. 
 As a global operator, our business also may be impacted by changes in U.S. policy or priorities in areas such as trade, immigration and/or environmental or labor regulations, among others. Depending on the nature and scope of any such changes, they could impact our domestic and international business operations. Any such changes, and any international response to them, could potentially introduce new barriers to passenger or crew travel and/or cross border transactions, impact our guest experience and/or increase our operating costs. 
 If we are unable to address these risks adequately, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected, including impairing the value of our ships and other assets. 
 The terms of our existing debt financing gives, and any future preferred equity or debt financing may give, holders of any preferred securities or debt securities rights that are senior to rights of our common shareholders. 
 The holders of our existing debt have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock in the event of liquidation. If we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock or convertible securities, the terms of the debt or the preferred stock issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. If we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, the ownership percentage of our existing shareholders would be diluted. 
 Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, fuel prices and interest rates could affect our financial results. 
 We are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, fuel prices and interest rates. Significant changes in any of the foregoing could have a material impact on our financial results, net of the impact of our hedging activities and natural offsets. Our operating results have been and will continue to be impacted, often significantly, by changes in each of these factors 
 A portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates. As a result, an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 6.0 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates, which is net of our interest rate swap agreements. This amount represented approximately 25.0 of our total indebtedness. As of December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 1 increase in prevailing interest rates would increase our forecasted 2023 interest expense by approximately 34.8 million. Additionally, the value of our earnings in foreign currencies is adversely impacted by a strong U.S. dollar. 
 Any further impairment of our goodwill, long-lived assets, equity investments and notes receivable could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. 
 We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. A challenging operating environment, conditions affecting consumer demand or spending, the deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions, expected ship deliveries, or other factors could result in a change to the future cash flows we expect to derive from our operations. Reductions of cash flows used in the valuation analyses may result in the recording of impairments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. 
 The loss of key personnel, our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel, or disruptions among our shipboard personnel could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Our success depends, in large part, on the skills and contributions of key executives and other employees and on our ability to recruit, develop and retain high quality personnel as well as having adequate succession plans and back-up operating plans for when critical executives are unable to serve. As demand for qualified personnel in the industry grows, we must continue to effectively recruit, train, motivate and retain our employees, both shoreside and on our ships, in order to effectively compete in our industry, maintain our current business and support our projected global growth. 
 We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified personnel primarily due to competitive labor markets. A prolonged shortage of qualified personnel and/or increased turnover may inhibit our ability to operate our business in an optimal manner, and may result in increased costs if we need to hire temporary personnel, and/or increased wages and/or benefits in order to attract and retain employees, all of which may negatively impact our results of operations. 
 As of December 31, 2022, approximately 88 of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. A dispute under our collective bargaining agreements could result in a work stoppage of those employees covered by the agreements. We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements when they expire. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage on our ships. We may also be subject to or affected by work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. Any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, as could a loss of key employees, our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our personnel. 
 If we are unable to keep pace with developments, design, and implementation in technology , our operations or competitive position could become impaired. 
 Our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems. These technologies and systems require significant investment and must be proven, refined, updated, upgraded and/or replaced with more advanced systems in order to continue to meet our customers demands and expectations as well as to process our information effectively. If we are unable to do so in a timely manner or within reasonable cost parameters, if there are any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in design or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train our employees to operate any of these new systems, our business could suffer. We also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system, which could impair our operating results. 
 We may be unable to procure appropriate technology in a timely manner or at all or we may incur significant costs in doing so. A failure to adopt the appropriate technology, or a failure or obsolescence in the technology that we have adopted, could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 We are exposed to cyber security attacks and data breaches and the risks and costs associated with protecting our systems and maintaining data integrity and security. 
 We are subject to cyber security attacks. These cyber attacks can vary in scope and intent from attacks with the objective of compromising our systems, networks, and communications for economic gain or with the objective of disrupting, disabling or otherwise compromising our maritime and/or shoreside operations. The attacks can encompass a wide range of methods and intent, including phishing attacks, illegitimate requests for payment, theft of intellectual property, theft of confidential or non-public information, installation of malware, installation of ransomware and theft of personal or business information. The frequency and sophistication of, and methods used to conduct, these attacks, have increased over time. 
 A successful cyber security attack may target us directly, or it may be the result of a third party s inadequate care, or resulting from vulnerabilities in licensed software. In either scenario, the Company may suffer damage to its systems and data that could interrupt our operations, adversely impact our brand reputation, and expose us to increased risks of governmental investigation, litigation, fines, and other liability, any of which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, responding to such an attack and mitigating the risk of future attacks could result in additional operating and capital costs in technology, personnel, monitoring and other investments. 
 We are also subject to various risks associated with the collection, handling, storage, and transmission of sensitive information. In the regular course of business, we collect employee, customer, and other third-party data, including personally identifiable information and individual payment data, for various business purposes. Although we have policies and procedures in place to safeguard such sensitive information, this information has been and could be subject to cyber security attacks and the aforementioned risks. In addition, we are subject to federal, state, and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information and individual payment data. Those laws include, among others, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and regulations of the New York State Department of Financial Services and similar state agencies that impose additional cyber security requirements as a result of our provision of certain insurance products. Complying with these and other applicable laws has caused, and may cause, us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices, and our failure to do so may expose us to substantial fines, penalties, restrictions, litigation, or other expenses and adversely affect our business. Further, any changes to laws or regulations, including new restrictions or requirements applicable to our business, or an increase in enforcement of existing laws and regulations, could expose us to additional costs and liability and could limit our use and disclosure of such information. 
 While we continue to evolve our cyber security practices in line with our business reliance on technology and the changing external threat landscape, and we invest time, effort and financial resources to secure our systems, networks and communications, our security measures cannot provide absolute assurance that we will be successful in preventing or defending from all cyber security attacks impacting our operation. There can be no assurance that any breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results. 
 Any breach, theft, loss, or fraudulent use of guest, employee, third-party or company data, could adversely impact our reputation and brand and our ability to retain or attract new customers, and expose us to risks of data loss, business disruption, governmental investigation, litigation and other liability, any of which could adversely affect our business. Significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem and prevent future breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. Further, if we or our vendors experience significant data security breaches or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches, we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation. 
 Litigation, enforcement actions, fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and/or damage our reputation. 
 Our business is subject to various U.S. and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions, fines, civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages. In addition, improper conduct by our employees, agents or joint venture partners could damage our reputation and/or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines. In certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters and/or our legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter. Such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We cannot predict the quantum or outcome of any such proceedings and the impact that they will have on our financial results, but any such impact may be material. While some of these claims are covered by insurance, we cannot be certain that all of them will be, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

 Item 2. Properties 
 Information about our cruise ships, including their size, may be found within the Operating Strategies - Fleet upgrade and maintenance section and the Operations - Cruise Ships and Itineraries sections in Item 1 . Business . Information regarding our cruise ships under construction, estimated expenditures and financing may be found within the Future Capital Commitments and Funding Needs and Sources sections of Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 Our principal executive office and principal shoreside operations are located in leased office buildings at the Port of Miami, Florida. We also lease a number of other offices in the U.S. and throughout Europe, Asia, Mexico, South America and Australia to administer our brand operations globally. 
 We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs and that we are capable of obtaining additional facilities as necessary. 
 We also operate two private destinations which we utilize as ports-of-call on certain itineraries: (i) an island we own in the Bahamas that we call CocoCay; and (ii) Labadee, a secluded peninsula that we lease on the north coast of Haiti. 
 
 Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 As previously reported, two lawsuits were filed against us in August 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (the "Court") under Title III of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, also known as the Helms-Burton Act. The complaint filed by Havana Docks Corporation ("Havana Docks Action") alleges it holds an interest in the Havana Cruise Port Terminal, and the complaint filed by Javier Garcia-Bengochea (the "Port of Santiago Action") alleges that he holds an interest in the Port of Santiago, Cuba, both of which were expropriated by the Cuban government. The complaints further allege that we trafficked in those properties by embarking and disembarking passengers at these facilities. The plaintiffs seek all available statutory remedies, including the value of the expropriated property, plus interest, treble damages, attorneys fees and costs. 
 The Court dismissed the Port of Santiago Action with prejudice on the basis that the plaintiff acquired his interest in the Port of Santiago after the enactment of the Helms-Burton Act. In November 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit affirmed the Court's dismissal of the lawsuit. 
 In the Havana Docks Action, the Court entered final judgment in December 2022 in favor of the plaintiff and awarded damages and attorneys' fees to the plaintiff in the aggregate amount of approximately 112 million. We have appealed the judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit and the plaintiff has cross-appealed with regards to the interest calculation used for purposes of determining damages. We believe we have meritorious grounds for and intend to vigorously pursue our appeal. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded a charge of approximately 130.0 million to Other (expense) income within in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss related to the Havana Docks Action, including post-judgment interest and related legal defense costs and bonding fees. 
 In addition, we are routinely involved in claims typical within the cruise vacation industry. The majority of these claims are covered by insurance. We believe the outcome of such claims, net of expected insurance recoveries, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations and cash flows.

 Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 Market Information 
 Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "RCL." 
 Holders 
 As of February 20, 2023, there were approximately 1,243 record holders of our common stock. Since certain of our shares are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of shareholders, the foregoing number is not representative of the number of beneficial owners. 
 Dividends 
 Holders of our common stock have an equal right, pro rata based on number of shares held, to share in our profits in the form of dividends when and if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available, subject to any rights of holders of preferred stock if any. Holders of our common stock have no rights to any sinking fund. 
 There are no exchange control restrictions on remittances of dividends on our common stock by reason of our incorporation in Liberia because (1) we are and intend to maintain our status as a nonresident Liberian entity under the Liberia Revenue Code of 2000 as amended and the regulations thereunder, and (2) our ship-owning subsidiaries are not now engaged, and are not in the future expected to engage, in any business in Liberia, including voyages exclusively within the territorial waters of the Republic of Liberia. Under current Liberian law, no Liberian taxes or withholding will be imposed on payments to holders of our securities other than to a holder that is a resident Liberian entity or a resident individual or an individual or entity subject to taxation in Liberia as a result of having a permanent establishment within the meaning of the Liberia Revenue Code of 2000 as amended in Liberia. 
 The declaration of dividends shall at all times be subject to the final determination of our board of directors that a dividend is prudent at that time in consideration of the needs of the business. In the event we declare a dividend, we will need to repay the amounts deferred under our export credit facilities as part of the principal amortization deferrals agreed with them during 2020 and 2021. Accordingly, we have not declared a dividend since the first quarter of 2020. Refer to Note 10 . Shareholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information on dividends declared. 
 Share Repurchases 
 There were no repurchases of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 In the event we repurchase shares of our common stock, we will need to repay the amounts deferred under our export credit facilities as part of the principal amortization deferrals agreed with our lenders during 2020 and 2021.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). (Refer to Note 1 . General and Note 2 . Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ). Certain of our accounting policies are deemed "critical," as they require management's highest degree of judgment, estimates and assumptions. We have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. We believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows: 
 Management's Plan and Liquidity 
 In the face of the global pandemic impact of COVID-19, we paused our guest cruise operations in March 2020 and began resuming guest cruise operations in 2021, with our full fleet in service by June 2022. 
 As part of our liquidity management, we rely on estimates of our future liquidity which include numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. The principal assumptions used to estimate our future liquidity consist of: 
 Expected timing of cash collections for cruise bookings; 
 Expected sustained increase in revenue per available passenger cruise day; 
 Expected increase in occupancy levels, reaching historical levels in the spring of 2023; and 
 Inflationary increases to our operating costs, mostly impacting the expected cost of fuel and food as compared to 2019. 
 We will continue to pursue various opportunities to raise additional capital to fund obligations associated with future debt maturities and/or to extend the maturity dates associated with our existing indebtedness or facilities. Actions to raise capital may include issuances of debt, convertible debt or equity in private or public transactions or entering into new or extended credit facilities. 
 Ship Accounting 
 Ships represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of ships is generally computed net of a 10 -15 projected residual value, using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which is generally 30-35 years. The 30-35 year useful life and 10 -15 residual value is the weighted-average of all major components of a ship. Our useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes, long-term cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarly-built ships. In addition, we take into consideration our estimates of the weighted-average useful lives of the ships' major component systems, such as hull, superstructure, main electric, engines and cabins. We employ a cost allocation methodology at the component level, in order to support the estimated weighted-average useful lives and residual values, as well as to determine the net cost basis of assets being replaced. Given the very large and complex nature of our ships, our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain. We do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems. However, we estimate the costs, useful lives and residual values of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives, as well as our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry. We do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems, but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished. Improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements' estimated useful lives or that of the associated ship. The estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized within Cruise operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. 
 We periodically review estimated useful lives and residual values for ongoing reasonableness, considering long term views on our intended use of each class of ships and the planned level of improvements to maintain and enhance vessels within those classes. In the event a factor is identified that may trigger a change in the estimated useful lives and residual values of our ships, a review of the estimate is completed. 
 We use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs. Under the deferral method, drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock, which we estimate to be a period of thirty to sixty months based on the vessel's age as required by Class. Deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel's Class certification. Class certification is necessary in order for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country, obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships. The activities associated with those drydocking costs cannot be performed while the vessel is in service and, as such, are done during a drydock as a planned major maintenance activity. The 
 
 28 

significant deferred drydock costs consist of hauling and wharfage services provided by the drydock facility, hull inspection and related activities (e.g., scraping, pressure cleaning, bottom painting), maintenance to steering propulsion, thruster equipment and ballast tanks, port services such as tugs, pilotage and line handling, and freight associated with these items. We perform a detailed analysis of the various activities performed for each drydock and only defer those costs that are directly related to planned major maintenance activities necessary to maintain Class. The costs deferred are related to activities not otherwise routinely periodically performed to maintain a vessel's designed and intended operating capability. Repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred. 
 We use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks, which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock costs. If the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock, the remaining balance in deferred drydock is written-off to the gain or loss on disposal of vessel in the period in which the sale takes place. We also use judgment when identifying costs incurred during a drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel's Class certification as compared to those costs attributable to repairs and maintenance which are expensed as incurred. 
 We believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes. However, should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship useful lives or projected residual values, depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower. If circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized, the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense. If we had reduced our estimated average ship useful life by one year, depreciation expense for 2022 would have increased by approximately 85.0 million. If our ships were estimated to have no residual value, depreciation expense for 2022 would have increased by approximately 307.6 million. We have evaluated our estimated ship useful lives and projected residual values in light of our current environment and determined that there are no changes to these estimates. 
 Valuation of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets 
 We review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or, when events or circumstances dictate, more frequently. The impairment review for goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment of whether it is more-likely than-not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, and if necessary, a goodwill impairment test. Factors to consider when performing the qualitative assessment include general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, changes in forecasted operating results, changes in fuel prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. 
 The goodwill impairment analysis consists of a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. We typically estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model, which may also include a combination of a market-based valuation approach. The estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues, operating costs, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, interest rates, ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industry's competitive environment and general economic and business conditions, among other factors. The principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model for our 2022 impairment assessment consisted of: 
 Forecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day; 
 Occupancy rates from existing and expected ship deliveries; 
 Vessel operating expenses; 
 Terminal growth rate; and 
 Weighted average cost of capital (i.e., discount rate). 
 The discounted cash flow model uses the most current projected operating results for the upcoming fiscal year as a base. We discount the projected cash flows using rates specific to the reporting unit based on its weighted-average cost of capital. 
 If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no write-down of goodwill is required. As amended by ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment , if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets, an impairment is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to such reporting unit. Refer to Note 4 . Goodwill to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information on goodwill. 
 
 29 

The impairment review for indefinite-life intangible assets can be performed using a qualitative or quantitative impairment assessment. The quantitative assessment consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of these assets using a discounted cash flow model and various valuation methods depending on the nature of the intangible asset, such as the relief-from-royalty method, for trademarks and trade names. The principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model for our 2022 impairment assessment consisted of: 
 Forecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day; 
 Occupancy rates from existing and expected ship deliveries; 
 Terminal growth rate; 
 Royalty rate; and 
 Weighted average cost of capital (i.e., discount rate). 
 If the carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. If the fair value exceeds its carrying value, the indefinite-life intangible asset is not considered impaired. Other intangible assets assigned finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Refer to Note 5. Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information on indefinite-life intangible assets. 
 We review our ships and other long-lived assets, including right-of-use assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate, based on recent and projected cash flow performance and remaining useful lives, that the carrying value of these assets may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate asset impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The lowest level for which we maintain identifiable cash flows that are independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities is at the ship level for our ships. If estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent its carrying value exceeds fair value. Refer to Note 6 . Property and Equipment to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information on determination of fair value for long-lived assets. 
 We estimate fair value based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If active markets are not available, we base fair value on independent appraisals, sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate estimated by management to be commensurate with the business risk. Quoted market prices are often not available for individual reporting units and for indefinite-life intangible assets. Accordingly, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinite-life intangible asset using an expected present value technique. 
 Royal Caribbean International Reporting Unit 
 During the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a qualitative assessment of the Royal Caribbean International reporting unit. Based on our qualitative assessment, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of the Royal Caribbean International reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and thus, we did not proceed to the two-step goodwill impairment test. No indicators of impairment exist primarily because the reporting unit's fair value has consistently exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin and forecasts of operating results expected to be generated by the reporting unit appear sufficient to support its carrying value. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to our Royal Caribbean reporting unit was 296.4 million. 
 We did not perform interim impairment evaluations of Royal Caribbean International's goodwill during 2022 as no triggering events were identified. 
 Silversea Cruises Reporting Unit 
 During the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2021, we performed our annual impairment review of Silversea Cruises goodwill. We did not perform qualitative assessments but instead proceeded directly to the goodwill impairment tests. As of November 30, 2022, and November 30, 2021, the fair value of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow model in combination with a market-based valuation approach. As a result of the tests, we determined the fair value of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 26 and 35 as of November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, resulting in no impairment to Silversea Cruises' goodwill. The carrying value of goodwill attributable to our Silversea Cruises reporting unit was 508.6 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 30 

During the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2021, we performed our annual impairment reviews of the Silversea Cruises trade name. As a result of the quantitative tests, we determined that the fair value of the Silversea Cruises' trade name exceeded its carrying value by approximately 25 and 19 , as of November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021, respectively, resulting in no impairment to Silversea Cruises' tr ade name. 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of indefinite-life intangible assets was 321.5 million, which primarily relates to the Silversea Cruises trade name. 
 We did not perform interim impairment evaluations of Silversea Cruises's goodwill or trade names during 2022 and 2021, as no triggering events were identified. 
 Derivative Instruments 
 We enter into various forward, swap and option contracts to manage our interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. These instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and the vast majority are designated as hedges. We also use non-derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investment in our foreign operations and investments. Although some of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not accounted for under hedge accounting, we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with authoritative guidance. Refer to Note 2 . Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 16. Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on related authoritative guidance, the Company's hedging programs and derivative financial instruments. 
 On a regular basis, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps, fuel swaps and options with third-party institutions in over-the-counter markets. We estimate the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps using expected future cash flows based on the instruments' contract terms and published forward prices for foreign currency exchange and interest rates. We value floors which are embedded within our interest rate swaps using standard option pricing models with inputs based on the options contract terms, such as exercise price and maturity, and readily available market data, such as forward interest rates and interest rate volatility. We apply present value techniques to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments. 
 We estimate the fair value of our fuel swaps using expected future cash flows based on the swaps' contract terms and forward prices. We derive forward prices from published forward fuel curves which in turn are based on actual market transactions and published price quotes for similar assets. We apply present value techniques to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments. We also corroborate our fair value estimates using valuations provided by our counterparties. 
 We adjust the valuation of our derivative financial instruments to incorporate credit risk. 
 We believe it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps, fuel swaps and options would be derived from other appropriate valuation models using similar assumptions, inputs or conditions suggested by actual historical experience. 
 Contingencies Litigation 
 On an ongoing basis, we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us. While it is typically difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions, we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries, if any, which are recorded as assets when recoverability is probable. We accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries, it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made.

Seasonality 
 Our revenues are seasonal based on demand for cruises. Demand has historically been strongest for cruises during the Northern Hemisphere's summer months and holidays. In order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the Northern Hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the Southern Hemisphere, our brands have historically focused on deployment to the Caribbean, Asia and Australia during that period. This seasonal trend was disrupted with the voluntary suspension of our global cruise operations effective March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. We resumed our global cruise operations commencing in the second half of 2021, with our full fleet in service by June 2022. Since our full fleet is in service, we expect to return to seasonal trends 
 
 Financial Presentation 
 Description of Certain Line Items 
 Revenues 
 Our revenues are comprised of the following: 
 Passenger ticket revenues , which consist of revenue recognized from the sale of passenger tickets and the sale of air transportation to and from our ships; and 
 Onboard and other revenues , which consist primarily of revenues from the sale of goods and/or services onboard our ships not included in passenger ticket prices, cancellation fees, sales of vacation protection insurance, pre- and post-cruise tours and fees for operating certain port facilities. Onboard and other revenues also include revenues we receive from independent third party concessionaires that pay us a percentage of their revenues in exchange for the right to provide selected goods and/or services onboard our ships, as well as revenues received for procurement and management related services we perform on behalf of our unconsolidated affiliates. 
 Cruise Operating Expenses 
 Our cruise operating expenses are comprised of the following: 
 Commissions, transportation and other expenses , which consist of those costs directly associated with passenger ticket revenues, including travel advisor commissions, air and other transportation expenses, port costs that vary with passenger head counts and related credit card fees; 
 Onboard and other expenses , which consist of the direct costs associated with onboard and other revenues, including the costs of products sold onboard our ships, vacation protection insurance premiums, costs associated with pre- and post-cruise tours and related credit card fees, as well as the minimal costs associated with concession revenues, as the costs are mostly incurred by third-party concessionaires and costs incurred for the procurement and management related services we perform on behalf of our unconsolidated affiliates; 
 Payroll and related expenses , which consist of costs for shipboard personnel (costs associated with our shoreside personnel are included in Marketing, selling and administrative expenses ); 
 Food expenses , which include food costs for both guests and crew; 
 Fuel expenses , which include fuel and related delivery, storage and emission consumable costs and the financial impact of fuel swap agreements; and 
 Other operating expenses , which consist primarily of operating costs such as repairs and maintenance, port costs that do not vary with passenger head counts, vessel related insurance, entertainment and gains and/or losses related to the sale of our ships, if any. 
 We do not allocate payroll and related expenses, food expenses, fuel expenses or other operating expenses to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total cruise vacation experience. 
 Selected Operational and Financial Metrics 
 We utilize a variety of operational and financial metrics which are defined below to evaluate our performance and financial condition. As discussed in more detail herein, certain of these metrics are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided along with the related GAAP financial measures as we believe they provide useful information to investors as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in 
 
 32 

accordance with GAAP. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents EBITDA (as defined below) excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful whe n assessing our profitability on a comparative basis. For the p eriods presented, these items included (i) other expenses, which includes our loss contingency in connection with the ongoing Havana Docks litigation recorded in 2022; (ii) impa irment and credit losses; (iii) restru cturing charges and other initiative expenses; (iv) equity investment asset impairments; (v) net insurance recoveries or costs related to the collapse of the drydock structure at the Grand Bahama Shipyard involving Oasis of the Seas ; (vi) Pullmantur reorganization settlement; (vii) the net gain recognized in 2021 in relation to the sale of the Azamara brand; (viii) the noncontrolling interest adjustment to exclude the impact of the contractual accretion requirements associated with the put option held by Heritage Cruise Holding Ltd. and (ix) transaction costs related to the 2018 Silversea Cruises acquisition. A reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. to Adjusted EBITDA is provided below under Results of Operations. 
 Adjusted Loss per Share ("Adjusted EPS") is a non-GAAP measure that represents Adjusted Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (as defined below) divided by weighted average shares outstanding or by diluted weighted average shares outstanding, as applicable. We believe that this non-GAAP measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis. A reconciliation of Loss per Share to Adjusted Loss per share is provided below under Results of Operations. 
 Adjusted Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. is a non-GAAP measure that represents net loss less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis. For the periods presented, these items included (i) loss on the extinguishment of debt (ii) the amortization of non-cash debt discount on our convertible notes (iii) the estimated cash refund expected to be paid to Pullmantur guests and other expenses incurred as part of the Pullmantur S.A. reorganization (iv) impairment and credit losses (v) equity investment asset impairments (vi) net insurance recoveries related to the collapse of the drydock structure at the Grand Bahama Shipyard involving Oasis of the Seas (vii) restructuring charges and other initiative expenses (viii) the amortization of the Silversea Cruises intangible assets resulting from the Silversea Cruises acquisition in 2018; for 2020, the change in the fair value in the Silversea Cruises contingent consideration;(ix) the noncontrolling interest adjustment to exclude the impact of the contractual accretion requirements associated with the put option held by Heritage Cruise Holding Ltd. (previously known as Silversea Cruises Group Ltd.) noncontrolling interest in Silversea Cruises, which noncontrolling interest we acquired on July 9, 2020 (x) the net gain recognized in the first quarter of 2021 in relation to the sale of the Azamara brand (xi) currency translation losses recognized during the second quarter of 2020, in connection with the ships classified as assets held-for-sale that were previously chartered to Pullmantur (xii) the net loss recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to the elimination of the three-month reporting lag for Silversea Cruises; and (xiii) loss contingency recorded in connection with the ongoing Havana Docks litigation inclusive of related legal fees and costs . A reconciliation of Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. to Adjusted Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. is provided below under Results of Operations. 
 Available Passenger Cruise Days (" APCD ") is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period, which excludes canceled cruise days and cabins not available for sale. We use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main non-capacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary. 
 EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents of Net Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. excluding (i) interest income; (ii) interest expense, net of interest capitalized; (iii) depreciation and amortization expenses; and (iv) income tax benefit or expense. We believe that this non-GAAP measure is meaningful when assessing our operating performance on a comparative basis. A reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. to EBITDA is provided below under Results of Operations. 
 Gross Cruise Costs represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing, selling and administrative expenses. 
 Carbon Intensity is our measurement of carbon dioxide emissions per gross tonne nautical mile (well-to-wake). 
 Net Cruise Costs and Net C ruise Costs Excluding Fuel are non-GAAP measures that represent Gross Cruise Costs excluding commissions, transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses and, in the case of Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel, fuel expenses (each of which is described above under the Description of Certain Line Items heading). In measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income, we believe changes in Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance. A reconciliation of Gross Cruise 
 
 33 

Costs to Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel is provided below under Results of Operations. For the 2022 period presented, Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel excludes restructuring and other initiative expenses. 
 Occupancy ("Load factor") , in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice, is calculated by dividing Passenger Cruise Days (as defined below) by APCD. A percentage in excess of 100 indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins. 
 Passenger Cruise Days represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises. 
 Although discussed in prior periods, we did not disclose or reconcile in this report our Gross Yields and Net Yields, as defined in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Historically, we have utilized these financial metrics to measure relevant rate comparisons to other periods. However, our 2022 and 2021 reduction in capacity and revenues, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, do not allow for a meaningful analysis and comparison of these metrics and as such these metrics have been excluded from this report. For Gross Cruise Costs, Net Cruise Costs, and Net Cruise Costs excluding Fuel we present amounts in constant currency compared to 2019, which is the last year of normalized operations.

Executive Overview 
 2022 was a transitional year filled with numerous accomplishments. We returned our entire fleet into operations, took delivery of Celebrity Beyond and Wonder of the Seas , and acquired Silver Endeavour . Additionally, we achieved positive EBITDA and operating cash flow for the year, controlled costs to minimize the impacts of inflation, and saw record shipboard revenues for the year. 
 Our 2022 Net Loss was (2.2) billion, or (8.45) per diluted share, compared to Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. of 1.9 billion, or 8.95 per diluted share in 2019, the most recent year of normalized operations. Adjusted Net Loss for 2022 was (1.9) billion, or (7.50) per diluted share, compared to Adjusted Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. of 2.0 billion, or 9.54 per diluted share in 2019. 2022 adjusted EBITDA was 711.6 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of 3.6 billion in 2019. We started 2022 by operating 51 ships and sailing at 57 load factor in the first quarter of 2022. We successfully completed the return of our entire fleet into operations during the second quarter and achieved 96 load factors in the third quarter with the Caribbean eclipsing triple digits at close to 105 during the third quarter. We finished the year sailing at almost 100 load factor in December 2022, with holiday sailings close to 110 during the fourth quarter. 
 Despite only partially operating for the first half of the year, total revenues were 8.8 billion in 2022, compared to 11.0 billion in 2019. Load factors for 2022 were 85 , and 96 for the second half of the year. Additionally, total revenue per passenger cruise day in 2022 was higher than record 2019 levels, driven by strong onboard revenue performance. 
 Cruise operating expenses increased from 6.1 billion in 2019 to 6.6 billion in 2022. Gross Cruise Costs per APCD increased 8.2 as-reported and 8.8 in Constant Currency, compared to 2019. Net Cruise Costs, excluding Fuel, per APCD increased 12.9 as-reported and 13.5 in Constant Currency, compared to 2019. Our cost-conscious mindset has helped to mitigate the effects of inflation, and we benefited from reduced costs related to health protocols as the year went on. For the year Net Cruise Costs included 5.97 per APCD of transitory costs related to health protocols, and one-time lagging costs related to fleet ramp up. 2022 also included Galveston terminal construction costs and increased costs associated with CocoCay, which were not present in 2019. 
 In 2023, we expect our capacity to increase by 14 compared to 2019, despite the reduction in capacity resulting from the divestiture of Azamara and the sale of older ships. Since 2019 we have welcomed 9 new ships across our five brands, and with the addition of Celebrity Ascent and Silver Nova in 2023 we expect a total of 11 new vessels operating by year end. These new ships, along with enhanced onboard offerings and continued investment in destinations, are expected to help drive increases in both Net Yields and Total revenues as our capacity expands. We also plan to continue investing in both more efficient newbuilds and retrofitting our existing fleet with technology to help reach our long-term goals to reduce carbon intensity. Lastly, we anticipate taking delivery of Icon of the Seas by the end of the year, to begin operating revenue sailings in 2024.

Results of Operations 
 In addition to the items discussed above under "Executive Overview," significant items for 2022 include: 
 Our Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Adjusted Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. for the year ended December 31, 2022 was (2.2) billion and (1.9) billion, or (8.45) and (7.50) per share on a diluted basis, respectively, reflecting our return to full operations, compared to Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Adjusted Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. of (5.3) billion and (4.8) billion, or (20.89) and (19.19) per share on a diluted basis, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Total revenues, excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency rates, increased by 7.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021. The increase reflects our full return to operations by June 2022 compared to 2021 when the suspension of our global cruise operations was in effect for a substantial portion of our fleet. APCDs for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 41,197,650 compared to 11,767,441, in the same period in 2021. 
 The effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our passenger ticket and onboard and other revenue transactions, denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, resulted in a decrease in total revenues of 149.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. 
 Total cruise operating expenses, excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency rate, increased by 4.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, which reflects our return to operations in 2022 compared to 2021 when the suspension of our global cruise operations was in effect for the substantial portion of our fleet. 
 The effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our cruise operating expenses, denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, resulted in a decrease in total operating expenses of 79.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. 
 In January 2022 and April 2022, we took delivery of Wonder of the Seas and Celebrity Beyond , respectively. To finance the purchases, we borrowed 1.3 billion and 0.7 billion, or approximately 0.7 billion based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2022, respectively, under previously committed unsecured term loans. Refer to Note 8 . Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information. Wonder of the Seas and Celebrity Beyond entered service in the first and second quarters of 2022, respectively. 
 In July 2022, we purchased the Silver Endeavour for our Silversea Cruises brand. To finance the purchase, we assumed 277 million of debt. Silver Endeavour entered service in the fourth quarter of 2022. Refer to Note 8 . Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we executed and amended various financing arrangements, we refinanced 6.9 billion of 2022 and 2023 maturities, which resulted in a total loss on extinguishment of debt of 93.8 million. Refer to Note 8 . Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information on our 2022 financing activity. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a loss contingency of 130.0 million inclusive of related legal fees and costs in connection with the ongoing Havana Docks litigation. Refer to Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information.

Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 
 In this section, references to 2022 refer to the year ended December 31, 2022 and references to 2021 refer to the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Revenues 
 Total revenues increased 7.3 billion, or 477.0 , to 8.8 billion in 2022 from 1.5 billion in 2021. 
 Passenger ticket revenues comprised 65.5 of our 2022 total revenues. Passenger ticket revenues increased by 4.9 billion, or 515.6 to 5.8 billion in 2022 from 0.9 billion in 2021 and was partially offset by unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar of 129.8 million. 
 The remaining 34.5 of total revenues was comprised of Onboard and other revenues , which increased 2.5 billion, or 415.6 to 3.0 billion in 2022 from 591.0 million in 2021 and was partially offset by unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar of 19.2 million . 
 The increase in total revenues was due to our return of operations, with our full fleet in service by June 2022, compared to 2021 when we began resuming guest cruise operations. Occupancy in 2022 was 85.1 compared to 49.3 in 2021. 
 Onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of 331.9 million in 2022 and 72.0 million in 2021. 
 Cruise Operating Expenses 
 Total C r uise operating expenses increased by 4.0 billion, or 148.9 , to 6.6 billion in 2022 from 2.7 billion in 2021. 
 The increase in Cruise operating expenses was driven by the return to operations in 2022, with the majority of our fleet in service compared to 2021, when the suspension of our global cruise operations was in effect. The 2022 operating expenses include the overhead costs associated with bringing our ships back to service and our crew back on board our ships. Additionally, inflationary pressures have impacted our operating costs, especially in fuel and food expense. Our cost of fuel (net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements) for 2 022 increased 43 per metric ton compared to 2021 mainly due to the increase in fuel price. 
 Marketing, Selling and Administrative Expenses 
 Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 0.2 billion, or 15.5 to 1.6 billion in 2022 from 1.4 billion in 2021. The increase was due to the ramp up of our global sales and marketing efforts starting in the second half of 2021 as we commenced our resumption of operations. Additionally, having our full fleet in service as of June 30, 2022 increased overall expenses compared to 2021. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expenses 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses increased 0.1 billion, or 8.8 , to 1.4 billion in 2022 compared to 1.3 billion. The increase was primarily due to the addition of Wonder of the Seas and Celebrity Beyond to our fleet in January 2022 and April 2022, respectively, and depreciation for Odyssey of the Seas and Silver Dawn, which were delivered in March 2021 and November 2021, respectively. 
 . Impairment and Credit Losses 
 Impairment and c redit losses for 2022 was 0.6 million compared to 82.0 million in 2021. The decrease in impairment loss was primarily due to 2021 impairment charges of ce rtain construction in progress projects that were reduced in scope or terminated as a result of COVID-19, which did not recur in 2022. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Interest expense, net of interest capitalized , increased 72.4 million, or 5.6 , to 1.4 billion in 2022 from 1.3 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily due to additional indebtedness associated with new ship deliveries. 
 
 Equity investment income for 2022 was 56.7 million compared to Equity investment Loss of 135.5 million in 2021. The increase in income was primarily due to income from TUI Cruises, one of our equity investments, in 2022 compared to losses in 2021. 
 
 44 

Other (expense) income decreased 140.7 million, or 693.5 , to other expense of 120.4 million in 2022 from other income of 20.3 million in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a loss contingency of 130.0 million recorded in connection with the ongoing Havana Docks litigation. 
 Other Comprehensive Income 
 Other comprehensive income in 2022 was 67.7 million compared to 28.5 million in 2021. The change was primarily due to Changes in defined benefits plan in 2022 of 48.9 million compared to 8.7 million in 2021.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities increased by 2.4 billion to cash provided of 0.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to cash used of 1.9 billion for the same period in 2021. Our full resumption of operations in 2022 generated an increase in guest ticket and onboard collections for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, compared to a partial resumption of operations in 2021. 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased by 843.0 million to cash used of 3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to cash used of 2.1 billion for the same period in 2021. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to an increase in capital expenditures of 480.4 million due to the increased cost associated with taking delivery of Wonder of the Seas and Celebrity Beyond in 2022 compared to taking delivery of Odyssey of the Seas and Silver Dawn in 2021, and an increase in cash paid on settlement of derivative financial instruments of 281.7 million in 2022 compared to 2021. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 1.7 billion in 2022 compared to cash provided of 3.0 billion in 2021. The decrease of 1.3 billion was primarily attributable to proceeds from common stock issuances of 1.6 billion during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to none during the same period in 2022, and offset by repayments of commercial paper notes of 414.6 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to none during the same period in 2022. 

Future Capital Commitments 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Our future capital commitments consist primarily of new ship orders. As of December 31, 2022, we have one Oasis-class ship, and three ships of a new generation, known as our Icon-class, on order for our Royal Caribbean International brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 22,500 berths. As of December 31, 2022, we have one Edge-class ship on order for our Celebrity Cruises brand, with a capacity of approximately 3,250 berths. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, we have two ships on order for our Silversea Cruises brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,460 berths. Refer to Item 1. Business-Operations for further information on our ships on order. We have committed financing arrangements in place covering 80 of the cost of the ship for the seven ships on order for our Global Brands, all of which include sovereign financing guarantees. Additionally, we have an agreement in place with Chantiers de l Atlantique to build an additional Edge-class ship for delivery in 2025, which is contingent upon completion of conditions precedent and financing. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate cost of our ships on order, excluding any ships on order by our Partner Brands, was approximately 9.8 billion, of which we had deposited 832 million. Approximately 52.3 of the aggregate cost was exposed to fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate at December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 16. Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments and Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . 
 We have been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted on our cash flows, liquidity and financial position by the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to preserve liquidity, we deferred a significant portion of our planned 2020, 2021 and 2022 capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2022, we anticipate overall full year capital expenditures, based on our existing ships on order, will be approximately 4.1 billion for 2023. This amount does not include any ships on order by our Partner Brands.

Material Cash Requirements 
 As of December 31, 2022, our material cash requirements were as follows (in thousands): 
 Payments due by period 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total Operating Activities: Interest on debt (1) 
 1,345,729 1,187,749 1,036,011 780,404 648,639 1,106,447 6,104,979 Investing Activities: Ship purchase obligations (2)

 ___________________________________________________________________ 
 . 
 (1) Long-term debt obligations mature at various dates through fiscal year 2037 and bear interest at fixed and variable rates. Interest on variable-rate debt is calculated based on forecasted debt balances, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements, using the applicable rate at December 31, 2022. Debt denominated in other currencies is calculated based on the applicable exchange rate at December 31, 2022. 
 (2) Amounts are based on contractual installment and delivery dates for our ships on order. Included in these figures are 5.7 billion in final contractual installments, which have committed financing covering 80 of the cost of the ships on order for our Global Brands, almost all of which include sovereign financing guarantees. Amounts do not include potential obligations which remain subject to cancellation at our sole discretion or any agreements entered for ships on order that remain contingent upon completion of conditions precedent. 
 Refer to Note 8 . Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for maturities related to debt. 
 Refer to Note 9 . Leases to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for maturities related to lease liabilities. 
 Refer to Funding Needs and Sources below for discussion on the planned funding of the above material contractual obligations. 
 As a normal part of our business, depending on market conditions, pricing and our overall growth strategy, we continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships. We may also consider the sale of ships or the purchase of existing ships. We continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances. If any of these were to occur, they would be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or through cash flows from operations. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements . 
 Refer to Note 7 . Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for ownership restrictions related to TUI Cruises. 
 Refer to Note 8 . Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for export credit agency guarantees. 
 Refer to Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for other agreements. 
 As of December 31, 2022, other than the items described above, we are not party to any other off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest, certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities, that either have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial position. 
 
 47 

Funding Needs and Sources 
 Historically, we relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations, draw-downs under our available credit facilities, the incurrence of additional debt and/or the refinancing of our existing debt and the issuance of additional shares of equity securities to fund our obligations. COVID-19 resulted in our voluntary suspension of global cruise operations from March 2020 up to our full fleet returning to service during the second quarter of 2022. The suspension of operations strained our sources of cash flow and liquidity, causing us to take actions resulting in reductions in our operating expenses, reductions in our capital expenses and new financings and other liquidity actions. 
 The Company continually identifies and evaluates actions to maintain adequate liquidity. These include, and are not limited to: further reductions in capital expenditures, operating expenses and administrative costs and additional financings. Additionally, we will continue to pursue various opportunities to raise additional capital to fund obligations associated with future debt maturities and/or to extend the maturity dates associated with our existing indebtedness or facilities. Actions to raise capital may include issuances of debt, convertible debt or equity in private or public transactions or entering into new or extended credit facilities. 
 We have significant contractual obligations of which our debt service obligations and the capital expenditures associated with our ship purchases represent our largest funding needs. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 7.6 billion of committed financing for our ships on order. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our obligations due through December 31, 2023 primarily consisted of 2.1 billion related to debt maturities, 1.3 billion related to interest on debt and 2.7 billion related to progress payments on our ship orders and, based on expected delivery date, the final installments payable due upon the delivery of Silver Nova, Icon of the Seas, and Celebrity Ascent . 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had liquidity of 2.9 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of 1.9 billion, 0.3 billion of undrawn revolving credit facility capacity, and a 0.7 billion commitment for a 364-day term loan facility which was terminated in February 2023 in connection with our completion of the 700 million 7.25 Priority Guaranteed Notes offering. Our revolving credit facilities were partially utilized through a combination of amounts drawn and letters of credit issued under the facilities as of December 31, 2022, which were subsequently amended in January 2023, as described in Note 8 . Debt to our consolidated financial statements. We have agreed with certain of our lenders not to pay dividends or engage in stock repurchases unless we repay the remaining principal payments that were deferred under our export credit facilities in 2020 and 2021. Refer to Note 10 . Shareholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information. 
 If any person acquires ownership of more than 50 of our common stock or, subject to certain exceptions, during any 24-month period, a majority of our board of directors is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of our board of directors on the first day of such period, we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities, which we may be unable to replace on similar terms. Our public debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a third-party acquisition of greater than 50 of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade. If this were to occur, it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations. 
 Based on our assumptions and estimates and our financial condition, we believe that we have sufficient financial resources to fund our obligations for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. However, there is no assurance that our assumptions and estimates are accurate as there is inherent uncertainty in our ability to predict future liquidity requirements. Refer to Note 1 . General, Management s Plan and Liquidity, to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information. 
 
 Debt Covenants 
 Our export credit facilities, our non-export credit facilities, and certain of our credit card processing agreements contain covenants that require us, among other things, to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio, limit our net debt-to-capital ratio, and maintain minimum liquidity, and under certain facilities, to maintain a minimum level of stockholders' equity. The fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated by dividing net cash from operations for the past four quarters by the sum of dividend payments plus scheduled principal debt payments in excess of any new financings for the past four quarters. Our minimum stockholders' equity and maximum net debt-to-capital calculations exclude the impact of Accumulated other comprehensive loss on Total stockholders' equity . In 2021 and 2022, the financial covenant levels were modified for 2023 and 2024. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with our financial covenants and we estimate that we will be in compliance for at least the next twelve months. 
 
 48 

Any further covenant waivers may lead to increased costs, increased interest rates, additional restrictive covenants and other available lender protections as may be agreed with our lenders. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain additional waivers in a timely manner, or on acceptable terms. If we require additional waivers and are not able to obtain them or repay the debt facilities, this would lead to an event of default and potential acceleration of amounts due under all of our outstanding debt and derivative contracts. Refer to Note 8 . Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information regarding debt covenants. 

Dividends 
 The declaration of dividends shall at all times be subject to the final determination of our board of directors that a dividend is prudent at that time in consideration of the needs of the business. In the event we declare a dividend or engage in share repurchases, we will need to repay the amounts deferred under our export credit facilities. Accordingly, we have not declared a dividend since the first quarter of 2020.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Financial Instruments and Other 
 General 
 We are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We try to mitigate these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies. The financial impact of these hedging instruments is primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged. We achieve this by closely matching the amount, term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged. Although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting, our objective is not to hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. Refer to Note 16. Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our long-term debt obligations including future interest payments. At December 31, 2022, approximately 75.0 of our long-term debt was effectively fixed as compared to 65.7 as of December 31, 2021. We use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense. 
 Market risk associated with our fixed-rate debt is the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates. We use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our fixed-rate debt to a floating-rate basis to manage this risk. During the quarter ended September 30, 2022, we redeemed our 5.25 senior unsecured notes due 2022 in full and terminated the related interest rate swap agreements, which resulted in the dedesignation of the fair value hedges and recognition of an immaterial loss representing the fair value hedge carrying amount adjustment on these notes. At December 31, 2022, there were no interest rate swap agreements for fixed-rate debt instruments. 
 The estimated fair value of our long-term fixed-rate debt at December 31, 2022 was 14.8 billion, using quoted market prices, where available, or using the present value of expected future cash flows which incorporates risk profile. The fair value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be an asset of 7.7 million as of December 31, 2021, based on the present value of expected future cash flows. A hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2022 would decrease the fair value of our hedged and unhedged long-term fixed-rate debt by approximately 369.4 million. 
 Market risk associated with our long-term floating-rate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates. We use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis to manage this risk. A hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our forecasted 2023 interest expense by approximately 34.8 million, assuming no change in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 At December 31, 2022, we maintained interest rate swap agreements on the following floating-rate debt instruments: 
 Debt Instrument Swap Notional as of December 31, 2022 (In thousands) Maturity Debt Floating Rate All-in Swap Fixed Rate Celebrity Reflection term loan 
 109,083 October 2024 LIBOR plus 0.40 2.85 Quantum of the Seas term loan

(1) Interest rate swap agreements hedging the Euro-denominated term loan for Harmony of the Seas include EURIBOR zero-floors matching the hedged debt EURIBOR zero-floor. Amount presented is based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2022. 
 (2) Interest rate swap agreements hedging the term loan of Odyssey of the Seas include LIBOR zero-floors matching the debt LIBOR zero-floor. The effective dates of the 383.3 million and 191.7 million interest rate swap agreements are October 2020 and October 2022, respectively. The unsecured term loan for the financing of Odyssey of the Seas was drawn on March 2021. 
 These interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges. 
 The fair value of our floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be an asset of 123.3 million as of December 31, 2022 based on the present value of expected future cash flows. These interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 Our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our ship construction contracts denominated in Euros, our foreign currency denominated debt and our international business operations. On a regular basis, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and, from time to time, we utilize cross-currency swap agreements and collar options to manage portions of the exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 The estimated fair value, as of December 31, 2022, of our Euro-denominated forward contracts associated with our ship construction contracts was a liability of 40.7 million, based on the present value of expected future cash flows. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate cost of our ships on order, not including ships on order by our Partner Brands, was approximately 9.8 billion, of which we had deposited 0.8 billion as of such date. Approximately 52.3 of the aggregate cost of the ships under construction was exposed to fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. A hypothetical 10 strengthening of the Euro as of December 31, 2022, assuming no changes in comparative interest rates, would result in a 511.7 million increase in the United States dollar cost of the foreign currency denominated ship construction contracts exposed to fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate. Our foreign currency forward contract agreements are accounted for as cash flow or net investment hedges depending on the designation of the related hedge. 
 Our international business operations subject us to foreign currency exchange risk. We transact business in many different foreign currencies and maintain investments in foreign operations which may expose us to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Movements in foreign currency exchange rates may affect the value of our earnings in foreign currencies and cash flows. We manage most of this exposure on a consolidated basis, which allows us to take advantage of any natural offsets. Therefore, weakness in one particular currency might be offset by strengths in other currencies over time. The extent to which one currency is effective as a natural offset of another currency fluctuates over time. In addition, some foreign currency exposures have little to no mitigating natural offsets available. 
 We consider our investments in our foreign operations to be denominated in relatively stable currencies and of a long-term nature. We address the exposure of our investments in foreign operations by denominating a portion of our debt in our subsidiaries' and investments' functional currencies and designating it as a hedge of these subsidiaries and investments. We had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments primarily in TUI Cruises of approximately 433.0 million, or approximately 461.9 million, through December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2021, we had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments primarily in TUI Cruises of approximately 97.0 million, or approximately 110.3 million. 
 We have included net gains of approximately 63.5 million and 47.7 million of foreign-currency transaction remeasurement and changes in the fair value of derivatives in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 On a regular basis, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and, from time to time, we utilize cross-currency swap agreements and collar options to minimize the volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than our functional currency or the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries. During 2022, we maintained an average of approximately 1.1 billion of these foreign currency forward contracts. These instruments are not designated as hedging instruments. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts resulted in losses of approximately (101.8) million, (30.9) million and (19.0) million, respectively, which offset gains (losses) arising from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in those same years of 93.0 million, 24.3 million and (1.5) million, respectively. These changes were recognized in earnings within Other income (expense) in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).

Fuel Price Risk 
 Our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates primarily to the consumption of fuel on our ships. Fuel cost, net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements, as a percentage of our total revenues, was approximately 12.1 in 2022, 25.1 in 2021 and 16.8 in 2020. We use fuel swap agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had fuel swap agreements to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 498.1 million, maturing through 2023. These fuel swap agreements are generally accounted for as cash flow hedges. The fuel swap agreements designated as hedges of projected fuel purchases represented 50 of our projected 2023 fuel requirements. The estimated fair value of our fuel swap agreements at December 31, 2022 was estimated to be a liability of 6.1 million. We estimate that a hypothetical 10 increase in our weighted-average fuel price from that experienced during the year ended December 31, 2022 would increase our forecasted 2023 fuel cost by approximately 61.0 million, net of the impact of fuel swap agreements.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon such evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that those controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission's (the "SEC"). 
 Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our management, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as stated in its report, which is included herein on page F-2. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d) during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there is only reasonable assurance that our controls will succeed in achieving their goals under all potential future conditions.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 
 Changes in Accounting Principles 
 
 As discussed in Notes 2 and 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2022, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for convertible notes and effective October 1, 2021, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for the consolidation of Silversea Cruises. 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
 Emphasis of Matter 
 
 As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the resulting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are having a material negative impact on the Company's operating cash flows and liquidity. Management's evaluation of these events and conditions and management's plan to mitigate these matters are also described in Note 1. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
 F-2 

accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 
 Liquidity Impact of COVID-19 
 
 As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, management believes the resulting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are having a material negative impact on the Company s operating cash flows and liquidity. Management has taken measures to manage liquidity, including the issuance of debt and shares of common stock, the amendment of credit agreements to defer payments, and the modification of covenant requirements and waivers. The principal assumptions used in management s estimate of future liquidity consisted of (i) the expected timing of cash collections for cruise bookings; (ii) the expected sustained increase in revenue per available passenger cruise day; (iii) the expected increase in occupancy levels to reach historical levels; and (iv) the inflationary increases to the Company s operating costs, mostly impacting the expected cost of fuel and food. Based on management s actions, as well as the Company s present financial condition and the assumptions on liquidity, management believes they have sufficient liquidity to fund their obligations for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of the financial statements. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impact of COVID 19 on the Company s liquidity is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the estimate of future liquidity; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s estimate of future liquidity and assumptions related to (i) the expected timing of cash collections for cruise bookings; (ii) the expected sustained increase in revenue per available passenger cruise day; (iii) the expected increase in occupancy levels to reach historical levels, and (iv) the inflationary increases to the Company s operating costs, mostly impacting the expected cost of fuel and food. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s estimate of future liquidity. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management s process for estimating future liquidity for the twelve months after the date the financial statements are issued; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the estimate; (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to the expected timing of cash collections for cruise bookings, the expected sustained increase in revenue per available passenger cruise day, the expected increase in occupancy levels to reach historical levels, and the inflationary increases to the Company s operating costs, mostly impacting the expected cost of fuel and food; and (iv) evaluating management s estimate of future liquidity and their disclosure in the consolidated financial statements regarding having sufficient liquidity to satisfy the Company s obligations for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of the financial statements. Evaluating management s assumptions related to the expected timing of cash collections for cruise bookings, the expected sustained increase in revenue per available passenger cruise day, the expected increase in occupancy levels to reach historical levels, and the inflationary increases to the Company s operating costs, mostly impacting the expected cost of fuel and food involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the Company; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. 
 
 Impairment Assessments Silversea Cruises Reporting Unit Goodwill and Trade Name 
 
 As described in Notes 2, 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2022 the Company s consolidated goodwill balance was 809 million and the indefinite-life intangible assets balance was 321 million, and the goodwill and trade name associated with the Silversea Cruises reporting unit and trade name was 509 million and 319 million, 
 F-3 

respectively. Management reviews goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets for impairment at the reporting unit level and asset level, respectively, annually or, when events or circumstances dictate, more frequently. The quantitative impairment assessment consists of a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit or asset with its carrying value. Fair value is estimated by management using a discounted cash flow model in combination with a market-based valuation approach for reporting units and a relief-from-royalty method for trade names. Management s principal assumptions for the Silversea Cruises reporting unit and trade name were forecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day, occupancy rates from existing and expected ship deliveries, vessel operating expenses, terminal growth rate, royalty rate, and weighted average cost of capital (i.e., discount rate). 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impairment assessments of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit goodwill and trade name is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimates; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s significant assumptions related to forecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day, occupancy rates from existing and expected ship deliveries, terminal growth rates, and discount rates for the goodwill and trade name impairment assessments, vessel operating expenses for the goodwill impairment assessment and the royalty rate for the trade name impairment assessment; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s goodwill and trade name impairment assessments, including controls over the valuation of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit and trade name. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management s process for developing the fair value estimates; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted future cash flow model and relief-from-royalty method; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the fair value estimates; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to forecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day, occupancy rates from existing and expected ship deliveries, terminal growth rates, and discount rates for the goodwill and trade name impairment assessments, vessel operating expenses for the goodwill impairment assessment and the royalty rate for the trade name impairment assessment. Evaluating management s assumptions related to forecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day, occupancy rates from existing and expected ship deliveries, vessel operating expenses and terminal growth rat es involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit and the Silversea Cruises brand; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of (i) the Company s discounted cash flow model and relief-from-royalty method, and (ii) the discount rate and royalty rate assumptions.

 global cruise brands: Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises (collectively, our "Global Brands"). We also own a joint venture interest in TUI Cruises GmbH ("TUIC"), which operates the German brands TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises (collectively, our "Partner Brands"). We account for our investments in our Partner Brands under the equity method of accounting. Together, our Global Brands and our Partner Brands operated a combined ships as of December 31, 2022. Our ships offer a selection of worldwide itineraries that call on more than destinations in over countries on all continents. 
 Management's Plan and Liquidity 
 As a result of the global pandemic impact of COVID-19, we paused our guest cruise operations in March 2020 and began resuming guest cruise operations in 2021, with our full fleet in service by June 2022. 
 As part of our liquidity management, we rely on estimates of our future liquidity which include numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. The principal assumptions used to estimate our future liquidity consist of: 
 Expected timing of cash collections for cruise bookings; 
 Expected sustained increase in revenue per available passenger cruise day; 
 Expected increase in occupancy levels, reaching historical levels in late spring of 2023; and 
 Inflationary increases to our operating costs, mostly impacting the expected cost of fuel and food as compared to 2019. 
 The resulting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are having a material negative impact on our operating cash flows and liquidity. We believe we have made reasonable estimates and judgments of the impact of these events to our consolidated financial statements; however, there can be no assurance the estimates and assumptions of our future liquidity requirements will be realized, and actual results could vary materially. We have taken proactive measures to manage our liquidity, including issuing debt and shares of our common stock, amending credit agreements to defer payments (see Note 8 . Debt ), obtaining relevant modification of covenant requirements and waivers (see Note 8 . Debt ), and during the pause, reducing operating expenses and capital expenditures. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had liquidity of billion, including billion of undrawn revolving credit facility capacity, billion in cash and cash equivalents and a billion commitment for a -day term loan facility which was terminated in February 2023 upon issuance of our million aggregate principal amount of Priority Guaranteed Notes. Our revolving credit facilities were utilized through a combination of amounts drawn and letters of credit issued under the facilities as of December 31, 2022, which were subsequently amended in January 2023, as described in Note 8 . Debt to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Based on our actions, as well as our present financial condition and the aforementioned assumptions on liquidity, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to fund our obligations for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of the financial statements. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with our financial covenants and we estimate we will be in compliance for the next twelve months. Refer to Note 8 . Debt for further information regarding refinancing transactions, and the applicable financial covenants. 
 We will continue to pursue various opportunities to raise additional capital to fund obligations associated with future debt maturities and/or to extend the maturity dates associated with our existing indebtedness or facilities. Actions to raise capital may include issuances of debt, convertible debt or equity in private or public transactions or entering into new or extended credit facilities.

Effective March 19, 2021, we sold our wholly-owned brand, Azamara Cruises ("Azamara"), including its -ship fleet and associated intellectual property, to Sycamore Partners for million, before closing adjustments. The March 2021 sale of Azamara did not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results, as we continue to provide similar itineraries to and source passengers from the markets served by the Azamara business. Therefore, the sale of Azamara did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations reporting. Effective March 19, 2021, we no longer consolidate Azamara's balance sheet nor recognize its results of operations in our consolidated financial statements. We recognized an immaterial gain on the sale during the quarter ended March 31, 2021 and have agreed to provide certain transition services to Azamara for a period of time for a fee. 
 On July 9, 2020, we acquired the remaining interest in Silversea Cruises that we did not already own from Heritage Cruise Holding Ltd. Prior to October 1, 2021, we consolidated the operating results of Silversea Cruises on a three-month reporting lag to allow for more timely preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Effective October 1, 2021, we eliminated the three-month reporting lag to reflect Silversea Cruises' financial position, results of operations and cash flows concurrently and consistently with the fiscal calendar of the Company ("elimination of the Silversea reporting lag"). The elimination of the Silversea reporting lag represents a change in accounting principle, which we believe to be preferable, because it provides more current information to the users of our financial statements. A change in accounting principle requires retrospective application, if material. The impact of the elimination of the reporting lag was immaterial to prior periods and is immaterial for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. As a result, we have accounted for this change in accounting principle in our consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2021. Accordingly, the results of Silversea Cruises from October 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021 are included in our consolidated statement of comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2021. To effect the change, we have reflected the third quarter 2021 operating results for Silversea Cruises, which were a net loss of million within Other income (expense) in our consolidated statement of comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2021.

- years, net of a - projected residual value. The - -year useful life and - residual value are based on the weighted-average of all major components of a ship. Our useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes, long-term cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarly-built ships. In addition, we take into consideration our estimates of the weighted-average useful lives of the ships' major component systems, such as hull, superstructure, main electric, engines and cabins. We employ a cost allocation methodology at the component level, in order to support the estimated weighted-average useful lives and residual values, as well as to determine the net cost basis of assets being replaced. Given the very large and complex nature of our ships, our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain. Depreciation for assets under finance leases is computed using the shorter of the lease term or related asset life, unless the asset is a finance lease due to title transferring or a purchase option that is reasonably certain of being exercised, in which case the asset is depreciated over the related asset life.

 We periodically review estimated useful lives and residual values for ongoing reasonableness, considering long term views on our intended use of each class of ships and the planned level of improvements to maintain and enhance vessels within those classes. In the event a factor is identified that may trigger a change in the estimated useful lives and residual values of our ships, a review of the estimate is completed. 
 We review long-lived assets, including right-of-use assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate, based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows, that the carrying value of these assets may not be fully recoverable. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The lowest level for which we maintain identifiable cash flows that are independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities is at the ship level for our ships. If estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent its carrying value exceeds fair value. Refer to Note 6 . Property and Equipment for further information on determination of fair value for long-lived assets. 
 We use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs. Under the deferral method, drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock, which we estimate to be a period of thirty to based on the vessel's age as required by Class. Deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel's Class certification. Class certification is necessary in order for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country, obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships. The activities associated with those drydocking costs cannot be performed while the vessel is in service and, as such, are done during a drydock as a planned major maintenance activity. The significant deferred drydock costs consist of hauling and wharfage services provided by the drydock facility, hull inspection and related activities (e.g., scraping, pressure cleaning, bottom painting), maintenance to steering propulsion, thruster equipment and ballast tanks, port services such as tugs, pilotage and line handling, and freight associated with these items. We perform a detailed analysis of the various activities performed for each drydock and only defer those costs that are directly related to planned major maintenance activities necessary to maintain Class. The costs deferred are related to activities not otherwise

 , utilizing market data relevant to the hedge horizon of each hedge relationship. High effectiveness is achieved when a statistically valid relationship reflects a high degree of offset and correlation between the changes in the fair values of the derivative instrument and the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or hedge accounting is discontinued, any change in fair value of the derivative since the last date at which it was determined to be effective is recognized in earnings. 
 Cash flows from derivative instruments that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the underlying hedged items. In the event that hedge accounting is discontinued, cash flows subsequent to the date of discontinuance are classified within investing activities. Cash flows from derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are classified as investing activities. 
 We consider the classification of the underlying hedged item s cash flows in determining the classification for the designated derivative instrument s cash flows. We classify derivative instrument cash flows from hedges of benchmark interest rate or hedges of fuel expense as operating activities due to the nature of the hedged item. Likewise, we classify derivative instrument cash flows from hedges of foreign currency risk on our newbuild ship payments as investing activities.

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50) - Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations. This ASU requires that a buyer in a supplier finance program disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of financial statements to understand the program s nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. This ASU is expected to improve financial reporting by requiring new disclosures about the programs, thereby allowing financial statement users to better consider the effect of the programs on an entity s working capital, liquidity, and cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, except for the amendment on roll forward information which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statement disclosures, although we do not expect the impact to be material.

 Passenger ticket revenues include charges to our guests for port costs that vary with passenger head counts.

The amounts of port costs charged to our guests and included within Passenger ticket revenues on a gross basis were million, million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 Our total revenues also include Onboard and other revenues , which consist primarily of revenues from the sale of goods and services onboard our ships that are not included in passenger ticket prices. We receive payment before or concurrently with the transfer of these goods and services to cruise passengers and recognize revenue over the duration of the related cruise. 
 As a practical expedient, we have omitted disclosures on our remaining performance obligations as the duration of our contracts with customers is less than a year.

 Customer Deposits and Contract Liabilities 
 Our payment terms generally require an upfront deposit to confirm a reservation, with the balance due prior to the cruise. Deposits received on sales of passenger cruises are initially recorded as Customer deposits in our consolidated balance sheets and subsequently recognized as passenger ticket revenues or onboard revenues during the duration of the cruise. ASC 606, Revenues from Contracts with Customers , defines a contract liability as an entity s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration from the customer. We do not consider customer deposits to be a contract liability until the customer no longer retains the unilateral right, resulting from the passage of time, to cancel such customer's reservation and receive a full refund. Customer deposits presented in our consolidated balance sheets include contract liabilities of billion and billion as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 
 We have provided flexibility to guests with bookings on sailings cancelled due to COVID-19 by allowing guests to receive future cruise credits FCC ). As of December 31, 2022, our customer deposit balance includes approximately billion of unredeemed FCCs. Given the uncertainty of travel demand caused by COVID-19 and lack of comparable historical experience of FCC redemptions, we are unable to estimate the number of FCCs that will not be used in future periods and get recognized as breakage. We will update our breakage analysis as future information is received. 
 Contract Receivables and Contract Assets 
 Although we generally require full payment from our customers prior to their cruise, we grant credit terms to a relatively small portion of our revenue sourced in select markets outside of the United States. As a result, we have outstanding receivables from passenger cruise contracts in those markets. We also have receivables from credit card merchants for cruise ticket purchases and goods and services sold to guests during cruises that are collected before, during or shortly after the cruise

 impairment for goodwill for the Silversea Cruises and Royal Caribbean International reporting units. 
 In respect to the Silversea Cruises reporting unit, we determined the fair value of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately , as of November 30, 2022. We did not perform interim impairment evaluations during the quarters ended March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022, and September 30, 2022 as no triggering events were identified. We used a discounted cash flow model in combination with a market-based valuation approach for the Silversea reporting unit. This requires the use of assumptions that are subject to risk and uncertainties. The principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analyses that support our Silversea Cruises reporting unit goodwill impairment assessment consisted of: 
 Forecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day; 
 Occupancy rates from existing and expected ship deliveries; 
 Vessel operating expenses; 
 Terminal growth rate; and 
 Weighted average cost of capital (i.e., discount rate) 
 We determined the Silversea Cruises reporting unit carrying value exceeded its fair value as of March 31, 2020. Accordingly, we recognized a goodwill impairment loss of million during the quarter ended March 31, 2020. As of November 30, 2021, we performed our annual goodwill impairment review and determined no incremental impairment losses existed. 
 For the Royal Caribbean International reporting unit, we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it was more-likely-than not that our Royal Caribbean International reporting unit's fair value was less than its carrying amount. The qualitative analysis included assessing the impact of certain factors such as general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, changes in forecasted operating results, changes in fuel prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Based on our qualitative assessment, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of the Royal Caribbean International reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. We did not perform interim impairment evaluations during the quarters ended March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022, and September 30, 2022 as no triggering events were identified.

Refer to Note 9 . Leases for for further information on the Silver Dawn finance lease. 
 Long-lived Assets impairments 
 We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate potential impairment losses exist. No triggering events were identified during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 During 2020, a number of vessels were found to have net carrying values in excess of their estimated undiscounted future cash flows and, as such, were subject to fair value assessments. Fair value was determined based on our intended use of the identified vessels and, as such, we used a combination of discounted cash flows, replacement cost, scrap and residual value techniques to estimate fair value. Differences between the estimated fair values and the net carrying values were recorded as an impairment charge within the period the loss was identified. Consequently, we recorded million of impairment losses during the year ended 2020. Included in this 2020 amount are million impairment losses recorded for the ships that we chartered to Pullmantur Holdings, prior to its filing for reorganization. Refer to Note 7 . Other Assets for further information regarding Pullmantur's reorganization. During the quarter ended September 30, 2020, we sold the ships previously chartered to Pullmantur Holdings to third parties for amounts approximating their carrying values and no further impairment was recorded. Also included in the million impairment loss for the year ended December 31, 2020, is a million impairment charge for the Azamara ships included in the sale of the Azamara brand, effective March 19, 2021. 
 Our principal assumptions used in our undiscounted cash flows consisted of: 
 Changes in market conditions and port or other restrictions; 
 Forecasted revenues net of our most significant variable costs, which are commissions, transportation and other expenses, and onboard and other expenses; 
 Occupancy rates; and 
 Intended use of the vessel for the remaining useful life. 
 We believe we have made reasonable estimates and judgements as part of our assessments. A change in principal assumptions may result in a need to perform additional impairment reviews. 
 During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 we also determined that certain construction in progress projects would be reduced in scope or would no longer be completed as a result of our capital cost containment measures in response to the COVID-19 impact on our liquidity. We recorded property and equipment impairment charges of million and million, and million, during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, which primarily related to construction in progress assets. 
 These impairment charges were reported within Impairment and Credit Losses in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.

 As of December 31, 2022, the net book value of our investment in TUIC was million, primarily consisting of million in equity and a loan of million, or approximately million, based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2021, the net book value of our investment in TUIC was million, primarily consisting of million in equity and a loan of million, or approximately million, based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2021. The loan, which was made in connection with the sale of Splendour of the Seas in April 2016, accrues interest at a rate of per annum and is payable over years. This loan is guaranteed by TUI AG and is secured by a first priority mortgage on the ship. The majority of these amounts were included within Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. During the quarter ended March 31, 2021, we and TUI AG each contributed million, or approximately million based on the exchange rate at March 31, 2021, of additional equity through a combination of cash contributions and conversion of existing receivables. In June 2021, Hapag-Lloyd Cruises received delivery of the Hanseatic Spirit , a berth luxury expedition cruise vessel. 
 TUIC has various ship construction and financing agreements which include certain restrictions on each of our and TUI AG s ability to reduce our current ownership interest in TUIC below through May 2033. Our investment amount and outstanding term loan are substantially our maximum exposure to loss in connection with our investment in TUIC. 
 We have determined that Pullmantur Holdings, in which we have a noncontrolling interest and Springwater Capital LLC has a interest, is a VIE for which we are not the primary beneficiary as we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance. In 2020, Pullmantur Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries filed for reorganization under the terms of the Spanish insolvency laws due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the companies, and on July 15, 2021, Pullmantur Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries filed for liquidation. We suspended the equity method of accounting for Pullmantur Holdings during the second quarter of 2020 as we do not intend to fund the entity's future losses and lost our ability to exert significant influence over the entity's activities as a result of the reorganization and liquidation process. 
 In connection with the reorganization, we terminated the agreements chartering of our ships to Pullmantur Holdings and sold the ships to third parties during the quarter ended September 30, 2020 for amounts approximating their carrying values. Refer to Note 6 . Property and Equipment for further discussion on the impact of the ships' sale on our consolidated financial statements. In addition, we recognized a loss of million within Other expense income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss), during the quarter ended June 30, 2020 representing deferred currency translation adjustment losses, net of hedging, as we no longer had significant involvement in the Pullmantur operation. 
 During the quarter ended June 30, 2020, we entered into an agreement with Springwater Capital LLC to settle the guarantees previously issued by them and for costs that we incurred as a result of Pullmantur S.A.'s reorganization. As part of this settlement, we agreed to provide Pullmantur guests the option to apply their paid deposits toward a Royal Caribbean International or Celebrity Cruises sailing, or request a cash refund. The estimated total cash refunds expected to be paid to

million and million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amount were recorded in Other operating and in Other (expense) income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. 
 We have determined that Grand Bahama Shipyard Ltd. ("Grand Bahama"), a ship repair and maintenance facility in which we have a noncontrolling interest, is a VIE. This facility serves cruise and cargo ships, oil and gas tankers and offshore units. We utilize this facility, among other ship repair facilities, for our regularly scheduled drydocks and certain emergency repairs as may be required. We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of this facility, as we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the facility's economic performance. Accordingly, we do not consolidate this entity. 
 In December 2022, we announced a new partnership with iCON Infrastructure Partners VI, L.P. ("iCON"), a fund, to develop strategic cruise port infrastructure. The proposed partnership will own, develop, and manage cruise terminal facilities and infrastructure in key ports of call, including PortMiami, and several development projects in Italy, Spain, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We expect to close on the transaction in the first half of 2023. Upon closing, PortMiami is expected to be considered a VIE for which we will be the primary beneficiary and will remain consolidated.

billion of senior notes (the "January 2022 Unsecured Notes") due in 2027 for net proceeds of approximately million. Interest accrues at a fixed rate of per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears. The proceeds from the January 2022 Unsecured Notes were used to repay principal payments on debt maturing in 2022 (including to pay fees and expenses in connection with such repayments). 
 In January 2022, we took delivery of Wonder of the Seas. To finance the delivery, we borrowed a total of billion under a credit agreement novated to us upon delivery of the ship in January 2022, resulting in an unsecured term loan which is guaranteed by Bpifrance Assurance Export ("BpiFAE"), the official export credit agency ("ECA") of France. The unsecured loan amortizes semi-annually over years and bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum. 
 In April 2022, we took delivery of Celebrity Beyond . To finance the delivery, we borrowed a total of billion or approximately billion based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2022, under a credit agreement novated to us upon delivery of the ship in April 2022, resulting in an unsecured term loan which is guaranteed by BpiFAE. The unsecured loan amortizes semi-annually over years and bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum. 
 In July 2022, we purchased Silver Endeavour for our Silversea Cruises brand. To finance the purchase, we assumed million of debt, which is guaranteed by Euler Hermes Aktiengesellschaft Hermes ), the official export credit agency of Germany. The loan amortizes semi-annually over years starting in July 2024 and bears interest at a floating rate equal to SOFR plus a margin of . The loan will mature in July 2037. 
 In August 2022, we issued billion of convertible senior notes which accrue interest at and mature in August 2025 (the "2025 Convertible Notes"). Upon conversion election, we may deliver shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of common stock and cash, at our election. The initial conversion rate per 1,000 principal amount of the convertible notes is 19.9577 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Prior to May 15, 2025, the convertible notes will be convertible at the option of holders during certain periods, and only under certain circumstances set forth in the 2025 Convertible Notes Indenture. 
 On or after May 15, 2025, the convertible notes will be convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding their maturity date. We received gross proceeds from the offering of billion, which we used to repurchase million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due June 15, 2023 and million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due November 15, 2023 (the "Existing Convertible Notes") in privately negotiated transactions. The billion repayment resulted in a total loss on the extinguishment of debt of million, which was recognized within Interest expense, net of interest capitalized within our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 In August 2022, we issued billion of senior unsecured notes which accrue interest at and mature in August 2027. The net proceeds of the offering of billion were used to repay debt that matured in 2022, including the million unsecured senior notes due November 2022, which resulted in an immaterial loss on extinguishment of debt. 
 In September 2022, we amended our billion unsecured term loan due October 2023. The amendments, among other things, extend the maturity date of advances under the facilities held by consenting lenders by 12 months to October 2024. Consenting lenders received a prepayment equal to of their respective outstanding advances. Following this amendment, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of advances under the unsecured term loan is million, with million maturing in October 2023 and million maturing in October 2024. 
 In October 2022, we issued billion aggregate principal amount of senior guaranteed notes due 2029 (the " Priority Guaranteed Notes") and billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2029 (the " Secured Notes" and together with the Secured Notes, the "Secured Notes"), both callable in April 2025. We used the combined net proceeds, of the respective offerings, together with cash on hand, to fund the redemption, including call premiums, fees and expenses, of our outstanding senior priority guaranteed notes due 2023 and senior secured notes due 2023, which resulted in a total loss on extinguishment of debt of million, which was recognized within Interest expense, net of interest capitalized within our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2022.

million under a previously committed unsecured term loan which is guaranteed by Euler Hermes Aktiengesellschaft Hermes ), the official export credit agency of Germany. The loan amortizes semi-annually over years and bears interest at a floating rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of . Prior to delivery during the first quarter of 2021, we amended the credit agreement to (i) increase the maximum loan amount under the facility to make available to us a maximum amount equal to the US dollar equivalent of of the vessel purchase price plus of the premium payable to Hermes and (ii) defer the payment of all principal payments due between April 2021 and April 2022, which amounts will be repayable semi-annually over a period starting in April 2022. 
 In March 2021, we issued billion of senior unsecured notes that mature in 2028, for net proceeds of billion. Interest on the senior notes accrues at per annum and is payable semi-annually. We used the proceeds from the notes to repay principal payments on debt maturing or required to be paid in 2021 and 2022, and the remaining for general corporate purposes. 
 In June 2021, we issued million of senior unsecured notes due in 2026 (the "June Unsecured Notes") for net proceeds of approximately million. Interest accrues on the June Unsecured Notes at a fixed rate of per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears. We fully repaid the Silversea Cruises senior secured notes due in 2025 (the "Silversea Notes"), in the amount of million, with a portion of the proceeds from the June Unsecured Notes. We also funded call premiums, fees and expenses in connection with the redemption of the Silversea Notes with proceeds from the June Unsecured Notes. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2021, we repaid in full a million term loan. 
 In August 2021, we issued billion of senior notes due in 2026 (the "August Unsecured Notes") for net proceeds of approximately million. Interest accrues on the August Unsecured Notes at a fixed rate of per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears. We used the proceeds of the August Unsecured Notes to replenish our capital as a result of the redemption of a portion of the senior secured notes due 2025 (the " Secured Notes"), in the amount of million plus accrued interest and premiums. As of December 31, 2022, approximately billion of the Secured Notes remains outstanding. The repayment of the Secured Notes resulted in a total loss on the extinguishment of debt of million, which was recognized within Interest expense, net of interest capitalized within our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Export credit agency guarantees 
 Except for the term loans we incurred to acquire Celebrity Flora and Silver Moon, all of our unsecured ship financing term loans are guaranteed by the export credit agency in the respective country in which the ship is constructed. For the majority of the loans as of December 31, 2022, we pay to the applicable export credit agency, depending on the financing agreement, an upfront fee of to of the maximum loan amount in consideration for these guarantees. We amortize the fees that are paid upfront over the life of the loan. We classify these fees within Amortization of debt issuance costs in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Prior to the loan being drawn, we present these fees within Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Once the loan is drawn, such fees are classified as a discount to the related loan, or contra-liability account, within Current portion of long-term debt or long-term debt . 
 Debt covenants 
 Our export credit facilities and our non-export credit facilities have an outstanding principal amount of approximately billion as of December 31, 2022. These facilities, as well as certain of our credit card processing agreements, contain covenants that require us, among other things, to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio, limit our net debt-to-capital ratio, maintain minimum liquidity, and under certain facilities, to maintain a minimum stockholders' equity. In July 2022, we amended our non-export-credit facilities and export credit facilities, and certain credit card processing agreements. Among other things, the amendments modified the levels at which our net debt to capitalization covenant will be tested during the period commencing immediately following the end of the waiver period (through the September 30, 2022 for non export and through December 31, 2022 for export facilities) and continuing through the end of 2025 and the amount of minimum stockholders' equity required to be maintained through 2025. The amendments continued to impose a monthly-tested minimum liquidity covenant of million, which in the case of the non-export credit facilities terminated at the end of the waiver period (with the exception of the Revolver which was amended in January 2023 to include the minimum liquidity through April 2025) and in the case of the export credit facilities terminates either in July 2025, or when we pay off all deferred amounts, whichever is earlier. In addition, the amendments to the non-export credit facilities continued to place restrictions on paying cash dividends and effectuating share repurchases through the end of the third quarter of 2022, while the export credit facility amendments require us to prepay any deferred amounts

million of cash collateral. 
 Additionally, we remeasured the ground lease related to the Terminal A lease based on a reassessed lease term resulting from our purchase option exercise. We determined that the ground lease should remain as an operating lease with adjustments to the operating lease liability and the related right-of-use asset in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. We estimate our incremental borrowing rates based on LIBOR and U.S. Treasury note rates corresponding to lease terms increased by the Company s credit risk spread and reduced by the estimated impact of collateral. In addition, we have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. However, for berthing agreements, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. 
 Finance Leases 
 Our finance leases primarily relate to buildings and surrounding land located at our Miami headquarters, and our Silver Dawn and Silver Whisper ships. Finance leases are included within Property, and Equipment , net, and Long-term debt with the current portion of the liability included within Current portion of long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 The Company's master lease agreement Master Lease with Miami-Dade County related to the buildings and surrounding land located at our Miami headquarters, has been classified as a finance lease in accordance with ASC 842, Leases . In January 2022, we executed a modification to the Master Lease to extend the expiration of the lease from 2072 to 2074. Subsequently, in December 2022 we amended the lease to further extend its expiration from 2074 to 2076 after coming to an agreement with Miami-Dade County on the financing plans for the continued development of the buildings and surrounding land at our Miami headquarters. The Master Lease continues to include the options to extend the lease. We continue to consider the probability of exercising the options as reasonably certain. The modifications of the Master Lease did not change the classification of the lease. The total aggregate amount of the finance lease liabilities recorded for this Master Lease was million and million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 
 Silversea Cruises operates Silver Dawn under a sale-leaseback agreement with a bargain purchase option at the end of the year lease term. Due to the bargain purchase option at the end of the lease term in 2036 whereby Silversea Cruises is reasonably certain of obtaining ownership of the ship, Silver Dawn is accounted for as a finance lease. The lease includes other purchase options beginning in year three, none of which are reasonably certain of being exercised at this time. The total aggregate amount of finance lease liabilities recorded for this ship was million and million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The lease payments on the Silver Dawn are subject to adjustments based on the LIBOR rate. 
 Silversea Cruises operates Silver Whisper under a finance lease. The finance lease for Silver Whisper will expire in 2023, subject to an option to purchase the ship, which we expect to exercise. The total aggregate amount of finance lease liabilities recorded for this ship was million and million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The lease payments on the Silver Whisper are subject to adjustments based on the LIBOR rate.

 We did not declare any dividends during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. During this period, we were restricted under certain of our credit facilities from paying dividends while waivers to the financial covenants within such facilities were in effect.

stock-based compensation plan, our 2008 Equity Plan, which provides for awards to our officers, directors and key employees. The 2008 Equity Plan, as amended, provides for the issuance of up to shares of our common stock pursuant to grants of (i) incentive and non-qualified stock options, (ii) stock appreciation rights, (iii) stock awards (including time-based and/or performance-based stock awards) and (iv) restricted stock units (including time-based and performance-based restricted stock units). During any calendar year, no one individual (other than non-employee members of our board of directors) may be granted awards of more than shares and no non-employee member of our board of directors may be granted awards with a value, measured as of the grant date, which together with cash compensation paid to such director for such calendar year, would exceed . Options and restricted stock units outstanding as of December 31, 2022, generally vest in equal installments over from the date of grant. In addition, performance shares and performance share units generally vest in . With certain limited exceptions, awards are forfeited if the recipient ceases to be an employee before the shares vest. We have not issued stock options since 2016, and all stock options have been exercised as of December 31, 2021. Stock option expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, are not material. 
 Our officers receive their long-term incentive awards through a combination of performance share units and restricted stock units. Each performance share unit award is expressed as a target number of performance share units based upon the fair market value of our common stock on the date the award is issued. The actual number of shares underlying each award (not to exceed of the target number of performance share units) will be determined based upon the Company's achievement of a specified performance target range. In 2022, we issued a target number of performance share units, which will vest approximately following the award issue date. The performance payout of these grants will be based on return on the Company's invested capital ("ROIC"), earnings per share ("EPS"), leverage and certain Environmental, Social, and Governance metrics ("ESG") for the year ended December 31, 2024, as may be adjusted by the Talent and Compensation Committee of our board of directors in early 2025 for events that are outside of management's control. 
 Our senior officers meeting certain minimum age and service criteria receive their long-term incentive awards through a combination of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units. The restricted stock awards are subject to both performance and time-based vesting criteria while the restricted stock units are subject only to time-based vesting criteria. Each restricted stock award is issued in an amount equal to of the target number of shares underlying the award based upon the fair market value of our common stock on the date the award is issued. Declared dividends accrue (but do not get paid) on the restricted stock awards during the vesting period, with the accrued amounts to be paid out following vesting only on the number of shares underlying the award which actually vest based on satisfaction of the performance criteria. The actual number of shares that vest (not to exceed of the shares) will be determined based upon the Company's achievement of a specified performance target range. 
 In 2022, we issued restricted stock awards, representing of the target number of shares underlying the award, all of which are considered issued and outstanding from the date of issuance; however, grantees will only retain those shares earned as the result of the Company achieving the performance goals during the measurement period. The performance payout of the 2022 awards will be based on the Company's ROIC, EPS, leverage and certain ESG metrics for the year ended December 31, 2024, as may be adjusted by the Talent and Compensation Committee of our board of directors in early 2025 for events that are outside of management's control.

As of December 31, 2022, we had million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to performance share unit grants, which will be recognized over the weighted-average period of years. 
 We estimate the fair value of each restricted stock award when the grant is authorized and the related service period has commenced. We remeasure the fair value of these restricted stock awards in each subsequent reporting period until the grant date has occurred, which is the date when the performance conditions are satisfied. We recognize compensation cost over the vesting period based on the probability of the service and performance conditions being achieved adjusted for each subsequent fair value measurement until the grant date. If the specified service and performance conditions are not met, compensation expense will not be recognized, any previously recognized compensation expense will be reversed, and any unearned shares will be returned to the Company.

 Basic loss per share is computed by dividing Net loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. by the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted loss per share incorporates the incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options and conversion of potentially dilutive securities. If we have a net loss for the period, all potential common shares will be considered antidilutive, resulting in the same basic and diluted net loss per share amounts for those periods. There were approximately , and antidilutive shares for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 Effective January 1, 2022, ASU 2020-06 eliminated the treasury stock method and instead required the application of the if-converted method to calculate the impact of convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share when instruments may be settled in cash or shares. Under the if-converted method, shares related to our convertible notes, to the extent dilutive, are assumed to be converted into common stock at the beginning of the reporting period. The required use of the if-converted method for our convertible notes did not impact our diluted loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2022 as the if-converted calculation was antidilutive for the period. For further information regarding the adoption of ASU 2020-06, refer to Note 2 . Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

million, which was limited to the cost of replacing the contracts in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to the contracts, the majority of which are currently our lending banks. We do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our significant counterparties. In addition, we have established guidelines we follow regarding credit ratings and instrument maturities to maintain safety and liquidity. We do not normally require collateral or other security to support credit relationships; however, in certain circumstances this option is available to us. 
 Derivative Instruments 
 We are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We try to mitigate these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies. The financial impact of these hedging instruments is primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged. We achieve this by closely matching the notional amount, term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged. Although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting, our objective is not to hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. 
 We enter into various forward, swap and option contracts to manage our interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. These instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and the vast majority are designated as hedges. We also use non-derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investment in our foreign operations and investments. 
 At inception of the hedge relationship, a derivative instrument that hedges the exposure to changes in the fair value of a firm commitment or a recognized asset or liability is designated as a fair value hedge. A derivative instrument that hedges a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows related to a recognized asset or liability is designated as a cash flow hedge. 
 Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges are offset against changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments. Gains and losses on derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss until the underlying hedged transactions are recognized in earnings. The foreign currency transaction gain or loss of our non-derivative financial instruments and the changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges of our net investment in foreign operations and investments are recognized as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss along with the associated foreign currency translation adjustment of the foreign operation or investment. In certain hedges of our net investment in foreign operations and investments, we exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize the related amounts directly into earnings. 
 On an ongoing basis, we assess whether derivatives used in hedging transactions are "highly effective" in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flow of hedged items. For our net investment hedges, we use the dollar offset method to measure effectiveness. For all other hedging programs, we use the long-haul method to assess hedge effectiveness using regression analysis for each hedge relationship. The methodology for assessing hedge effectiveness is applied on a consistent basis for each one of our hedging programs (i.e., interest rate, foreign currency ship construction, foreign currency net investment and fuel). For our regression analyses, we use an observation period of up to , utilizing market data relevant to the hedge horizon of each hedge relationship. High effectiveness is achieved when a statistically valid relationship reflects a high degree of offset and correlation between the changes in the fair values of the derivative instrument and the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or hedge accounting is discontinued, any change in fair value of the derivative since the last date at which it was determined to be highly effective is recognized in earnings. 
 Cash flows from derivative instruments that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the underlying hedged items. In the event that hedge accounting is discontinued, cash flows subsequent to the date of discontinuance are classified within investing activities. Cash flows from derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are classified as investing activities.

and , respectively, of our debt was effectively fixed-rate debt. We use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense. 
 Market risk associated with our fixed-rate debt is the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates. We use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our fixed-rate debt to a floating-rate basis to manage this risk. During the quarter ended September 30, 2022, we redeemed our senior unsecured notes due 2022 in full and terminated the related interest rate swap agreements, which resulted in the dedesignation of the fair value hedges and recognition of an immaterial loss representing the fair value hedge carrying amount adjustment on these notes. At December 31, 2022, there were no interest rate swap agreements for fixed-rate debt instruments. 
 We use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis to manage the risk of increasing interest rates.

 These interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges. 
 The notional amount of interest rate swap agreements related to outstanding debt as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was billion and billion, respectively. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 Derivative Instruments 
 Our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our ship construction contracts denominated in Euros, our foreign currency denominated debt and our international business operations. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage portions of the exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate cost of our ships on order was billion, of which we had deposited million as of such date. These amounts do not include any ships placed on order that are contingent upon completion of conditions precedent and/or financing any ships on order by our Partner Brands. Refer to Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies , for further information on our ships on order. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately and , respectively, of the aggregate cost of the ships under construction was exposed to

billion of these foreign currency forward contracts. These instruments are not designated as hedging instruments. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts resulted in losses of ) million, ) million and ) million, respectively, which offset gains (losses) arising from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in those same years of million, million and ) million, respectively. These amounts were recognized in earnings within Other (expense) income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. 
 The notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts, excluding the forward contracts entered into to minimize remeasurement volatility, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was billion and billion, respectively. 
 Non-Derivative Instruments 
 We consider our investments in our foreign operations to be denominated in relatively stable currencies and of a long-term nature. We address the exposure of our investments in foreign operations by denominating a portion of our debt in our subsidiaries' and investments' functional currencies and designating it as a hedge of these subsidiaries and investments. We had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments primarily in TUI Cruises of million, or approximately million, as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2021, we had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments primarily in TUI Cruises of million, or approximately million. 
 Fuel Price Risk 
 Our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates primarily to the consumption of fuel on our ships. We use fuel swap agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices. 
 Our fuel swap agreements are generally accounted for as cash flow hedges. In the case that our hedged forecasted fuel consumption is not probable of occurring, hedge accounting will be discontinued and the related accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss will be reclassified to Other (expense) income immediately. For hedged forecasted fuel consumption that remains possible of occurring, hedge accounting will be discontinued and the related accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss will remain in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss until the underlying hedged transactions are recognized in earnings or the related hedged forecasted fuel consumption is deemed probable of not occurring. 
 Prior suspension of our cruise operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic and our gradual resumption of cruise operations resulted in reductions to our forecasted fuel purchases. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we discontinued cash flow hedge accounting on million metric tons of our fuel swap agreements maturing in 2021 and 2022, which resulted in the reclassification of a net million loss from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to Other income (expense) . During the year ended December 31, 2022, we did not discontinue cash flow hedge accounting on any of our fuel swap agreements. Changes in the fair value of fuel swaps for which cash flow hedge accounting was discontinued are currently recognized in Other (expense) income for each reporting period through the maturity dates of the fuel swaps. 
 Future s uspension of our operations or modifications to our itineraries may affect our expected forecasted fuel purchases which could result in further discontinuance of fuel swap cash flow hedge accounting and the reclassification of deferred gains or losses from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings . 
 At December 31, 2022, we have hedged the variability in future cash flows for certain forecasted fuel transactions occurring through 2023.

 Credit Related Contingent Features 
 Our current interest rate derivative instruments require us to post collateral if our Standard Poor s and Moody s credit ratings fall below specified levels. Specifically, under most of our agreements, if on the fifth anniversary of executing a derivative instrument, or on any succeeding fifth-year anniversary, our credit ratings for our senior unsecured debt is rated below BBB- by Standard Poor s and Baa3 by Moody s, then the counterparty will periodically have the right to demand that we post collateral in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the net market value of all derivative transactions with such counterparty that have reached their fifth year anniversary, to the extent negative, and (ii) the applicable minimum call amount. 
 The amount of collateral required to be posted will change as, and to the extent, our net liability position increases or decreases by more than the applicable minimum call amount. If our credit rating for our senior unsecured debt is subsequently equal to or above BBB- by Standard Poor s or Baa3 by Moody s, then any collateral posted at such time will be released to us and we will no longer be required to post collateral unless we meet the collateral trigger requirement, generally, at the next fifth-year anniversary. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our senior unsecured debt credit rating was B by Standard Poor's and B3 by Moody's. As of December 31, 2022, of our interest rate derivative hedges had reached their fifth-year anniversary; however, the net market value for these derivative hedges were in a net asset position, and accordingly, we were not required to post any collateral as of such date.

Additionally as of December 31, 2022, we had ships on order with an aggregate capacity of approximately berths for our Silversea Cruises brand. The following provides further information on recent developments with respect to our ship orders. 
 In September 2019, Silversea Cruises entered into credit agreements, guaranteed by us, for the unsecured financing of the first and second Evolution-class ships for an amount of up to of each ship's contract price through facilities to be guaranteed by Euler Hermes, the official export credit agency of Germany.

The first and second Evolution-class ships will each have a capacity of approximately berths. In September 2021, we amended the credit agreements for the first and second Evolution-class ships to increase their maximum loan amounts by million on an aggregate basis, or approximately million based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2022. At our election, interest on incremental portion of each loan will accrue either (1) at a fixed rate of and , respectively (inclusive of the applicable margin) or (2) at a floating rate equal to LIBOR plus and , respectively. 
 In December 2019, we entered into a credit agreement for the unsecured financing of the sixth Oasis-class ship for up to of the ship s contract price through a facility to be guaranteed by BpiFrance Assurance Export, the official export credit agency of France. Under the financing arrangement, we have the right, but not the obligation, to satisfy the obligations to be incurred upon delivery and acceptance of the ship under the shipbuilding contract by assuming, at delivery and acceptance, the debt indirectly incurred by the shipbuilder during the construction of the ship. The maximum loan amount under the facility is not to exceed the United States dollar equivalent of billion, or approximately billion based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2022. The loan will amortize semi-annually and will mature years following delivery of the ship. Interest on the loan will accrue at a fixed rate of (inclusive of margin). The sixth Oasis-class ship will have a capacity of approximately berths. 
 In December 2019, we entered into a credit agreement for the unsecured financing of the third Icon-class ship for up to of the ship s contract price. Finnvera plc, the official export credit agency of Finland, has agreed to guarantee of the substantial majority of the financing, with a smaller portion of the financing to be guaranteed by Euler Hermes. The maximum loan amount under the facility is not to exceed the United States dollar equivalent of billion, or approximately billion based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2022.

 Litigation 
 As previously reported, lawsuits were filed against us in August 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (the "Court") under Title III of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, also known as the Helms-Burton Act. The complaint filed by Havana Docks Corporation ("Havana Docks Action") alleges it holds an interest in the Havana Cruise Port Terminal, and the complaint filed by Javier Garcia-Bengochea (the "Port of Santiago Action") alleges that he holds an interest in the Port of Santiago, Cuba, both of which were expropriated by the Cuban government. The complaints further allege that we trafficked in those properties by embarking and disembarking passengers at these facilities. The plaintiffs seek all available statutory remedies, including the value of the expropriated property, plus interest, treble damages, attorneys fees and costs. 
 The Court dismissed the Port of Santiago Action with prejudice on the basis that the plaintiff acquired his interest in the Port of Santiago after the enactment of the Helms-Burton Act. In November 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit affirmed the Court's dismissal of the lawsuit.

million. We have appealed the judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit and the plaintiff has cross-appealed with regards to the interest calculation used for purposes of determining damages. We believe we have meritorious grounds for and intend to vigorously pursue our appeal. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded a charge of approximately million to Other (expense) income within our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss related to the Havana Docks Action, including post-judgment interest and related legal defense costs and bonding fees. 
 In addition, we are routinely involved in claims typical within the cruise vacation industry. The majority of these claims are covered by insurance. We believe the outcome of such claims, net of expected insurance recoveries, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations and cash flows. 
 Other 
 Some of the contracts that we enter into include indemnification provisions that obligate us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events occur. These contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes, increased lender capital costs and other similar costs. The indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business. There are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments, if any, under these indemnification clauses. We have not been required to make any payments under such indemnification clauses in the past and, under current circumstances, we do not believe an indemnification in any material amount is probable. 
 If any person acquires ownership of more than of our common stock or, subject to certain exceptions, during any -month period, a majority of our board of directors is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of our board of directors on the first day of such period, we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities, which we may be unable to replace on similar terms. Our public debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a third-party acquisition of greater than of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade. If this were to occur, it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations.

Any such notice shall (i) describe in reasonable detail the capital adequacy or liquidity requirements which have been imposed, together with the approximate date of the effectiveness thereof, (ii) set forth the amount of such lowered return, (iii) describe the manner in which such amount has been calculated, (iv) certify that the method used to calculate such amount is such Lender Party s standard method of calculating such amount, (v) certify that such request for such additional amounts is consistent with its treatment of other borrowers that are subject to similar provisions and (vi) certify that, to the best of its knowledge, such change in circumstances is of general application to the commercial banking industry in the jurisdictions in which such Lender Party does business. In determining such amount, such Lender Party may use any method of averaging and attribution that it shall, subject to the foregoing sentence, deem applicable. Each Lender Party agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different lending office if the making of such a designation would avoid such reduction in such rate of return and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender Party, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender Party. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender Party to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender Party s right to demand such compensation provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender Party pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than three months prior to the date that such Lender Party notifies the 
 55 

Borrower of the circumstance giving rise to such reductions and of such Lender Party s intention to claim compensation therefor provided , further , that, if the circumstance giving rise to such reductions is retroactive, then the three-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof, but not more than six months prior to the date that such Lender Party notifies the Borrower of the circumstance giving rise to such reductions and of such Lender Party s intention to claim compensation therefor. 
 Section 3.6. Taxes . All payments by the Borrower of principal of, and interest on, the Advances and all other amounts payable hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any present or future income, excise, stamp or franchise taxes and other taxes, fees, duties, withholdings or other charges of any nature whatsoever imposed by any taxing authority, but excluding, with respect to each Lender Party, taxes imposed on or measured by such Lender Party s net income or receipts and franchise taxes imposed in lieu of net income taxes or taxes on receipts, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender Party is organized or any political subdivision thereof or the jurisdiction of such Lender Party s lending office or any political subdivision thereof or any other jurisdiction unless such net income taxes are imposed solely as a result of the Borrower s activities in such other jurisdiction, and any taxes imposed under FATCA (such non-excluded items being called Taxes ). In the event that any withholding or deduction from any payment to be made by the Borrower hereunder is required in respect of any Taxes pursuant to any applicable law, rule or regulation, then the Borrower will 
 (a) pay directly to the relevant authority the full amount required to be so withheld or deducted 
 (b) promptly forward to the Administrative Agent an official receipt or other documentation satisfactory to the Administrative Agent evidencing such payment to such authority and 
 (c) pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lender Parties such additional amount or amounts as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by each Lender Party will equal the full amount such Lender Party would have received had no such withholding or deduction been required. 
 Moreover, if any Taxes are directly asserted against the Administrative Agent or any Lender Party with respect to any payment received by the Administrative Agent or such Lender Party hereunder, the Administrative Agent or such Lender Party may pay such Taxes and the Borrower will promptly pay such additional amounts (including any penalties, interest or expenses) as is necessary in order that the net amount received by such Person after the payment of such Taxes (including any Taxes on such additional amount) shall equal the amount such Person would have received had no such Taxes been asserted. 
 Any Lender Party claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its lending office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender Party, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender Party. 
 If the Borrower fails to pay any Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lender Parties, the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Lender Parties for any incremental withholding Taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by any Lender Party as a result of any such failure (so long as such amount did not become payable as a result of the failure of such Lender Party to provide timely notice to the 
 56 

Borrower of the assertion of a liability related to the payment of Taxes). For purposes of this Section 3.6 , a distribution hereunder by the Administrative Agent or any Lender Party to or for the account of any Lender Party shall be deemed a payment by the Borrower. 
 If any Lender Party is entitled to any refund, credit, deduction or other reduction in tax by reason of any payment made by the Borrower in respect of any tax under this Section 3.6 or by reason of any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.3 , such Lender Party shall use reasonable efforts to obtain such refund, credit, deduction or other reduction and, promptly after receipt thereof, will pay to the Borrower such amount plus any interest received by such Lender Party in connection with such refund, credit, deduction or reduction) as is equal to the net after-tax value to such Lender Party of such part of such refund, credit, deduction or reduction as such Lender Party reasonably determines is allocable to such tax or such payment (less out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Lender Party) provided that no Lender Party shall be obligated to disclose to the Borrower any information regarding its tax affairs or tax computations. 
 Each Lender Party (and each Participant) agrees with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that it will (i) in the case of a Lender Party or a Participant that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States (a) provide to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower an appropriately executed copy of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI certifying that any payments made to or for the benefit of such Lender Party or such Participant are effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States (or, alternatively, an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E claiming the benefits of a tax treaty, but only if the applicable treaty described in such form provides for a complete exemption from U.S. federal income tax withholding), or any successor form, on or prior to the date hereof (or, in the case of any assignee as provided for in Section 11.11.1 or Participant, on or prior to the date of the relevant assignment or participation) in each case attached to an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY, if appropriate, (b) notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower if the certifications made on any form provided pursuant to this paragraph are no longer accurate and true in all material respects and (c) provide such other tax forms or other documents as shall be prescribed by applicable law, if any, or as otherwise reasonably requested, to demonstrate, to the extent applicable, that payments to such Lender Party (or Participant) hereunder are exempt from withholding under FATCA, and (ii) in all cases, provide such forms, certificates or other documents or information, as and when reasonably requested by the Borrower, necessary to claim any applicable exemption from, or reduction of, Taxes or any payments made to or for benefit of such Lender Party or such Participant provided that the Lender Party or Participant is legally able to deliver such forms, certificates or other documents. For any period with respect to which a Lender Party (or Participant) has failed to provide the Borrower with the foregoing forms (other than if such failure is due to a change in law occurring after the date on which a form originally was required to be provided (which, in the case of an assignee as provided for in Section 11.11.1 , would be the date on which the original assignor was required to provide such form) or if such form otherwise is not required hereunder) such Lender Party (or Participant) shall not be entitled to the benefits of this Section 3.6 with respect to Taxes imposed by reason of such failure. 
 Section 3.7. Reserve Costs . Without in any way limiting the Borrower s obligations under Section 3.3 , the Borrower shall pay to each Lender on the last day of each Interest Period of each SOFR Advance, so long as the relevant lending office of such Lender is required to maintain reserves against Eurocurrency liabilities under Regulation D of the F.R.S. Board, upon notice from such Lender, an additional amount equal to the product of the following for each SOFR Advance for each day during such Interest Period 
 (i) the principal amount of such SOFR Advance outstanding on such day and 
 57 

(ii) the remainder of (x) a fraction the numerator of which is the rate (expressed as a decimal) at which interest accrues on such SOFR Advance for such Interest Period as provided in this Agreement (less the Applicable Margin applicable to the relevant SOFR Advances and the relevant Applicable Percentage) and the denominator of which is one minus any increase after the Effective Date in the effective rate (expressed as a decimal) at which such reserve requirements are imposed on such Lender minus (y) such numerator and 
 (iii) 1 360. 
 Such notice shall (i) describe in reasonable detail the reserve requirement that has been imposed, together with the approximate date of the effectiveness thereof, (ii) set forth the applicable reserve percentage, (iii) certify that such request is consistent with such Lender s treatment of other borrowers that are subject to similar provisions and (iv) certify that, to the best of its knowledge, such requirements are of general application in the commercial banking industry in the United States. 
 Each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to avoid the requirement of maintaining such reserves (including by designating a different lending office) if such efforts would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. 
 Section 3.8. Replacement Lenders, etc. If the Borrower shall be required to make any payment to any Lender pursuant to Section 3.3 , 3.4 , 3.5 , 3.6 or 3.7 , the Borrower shall be entitled at any time (so long as no Default and no Prepayment Event shall have occurred and be continuing) within 180 days after receipt of notice from such Lender Party of such required payment to (a) terminate such Lender Party s Revolving Credit Commitment (whereupon the Ratable Shares of each other Lender Party shall automatically be adjusted to an amount equal to each such Lender Party s ratable share of the remaining Revolving Credit Commitments), and such Lender Party s right to receive any facility fee accruing after such termination, (b) prepay the affected portion of such Lender Party s Advances in full, together with accrued interest thereon through the date of such prepayment provided that the Borrower shall not prepay any such Lender Party pursuant to this clause (b) without replacing such Lender Party pursuant to the following clause (c) until a 30-day period shall have elapsed during which the Borrower and the Agents shall have attempted in good faith to replace such Lender Party), and or (c) replace such Lender Party with another financial institution reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, the Swing Line Bank and each Issuing Bank provided that (i) each such assignment shall be either an assignment of all of the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender Party under this Agreement or an assignment of a portion of such rights and obligations made concurrently with another such assignment or other such assignments that together cover all of the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender Party under this Agreement and (ii) no Lender Party shall be obligated to make any such assignment as a result of a demand by the Borrower pursuant to this Section unless and until such Lender Party shall have received one or more payments from either the Borrower or one or more assignees in an aggregate amount at least equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Advances owing to such Lender Party, together with accrued interest thereon to the date of payment of such principal amount and all other amounts payable to such Lender Party under this Agreement. Each Lender Party represents and warrants to the Borrower that, as of the date of this Agreement (or, with respect to any Lender Party not a party hereto on the date hereof, on the date that such Lender Party becomes a party hereto), there is no existing treaty, law, regulation, regulatory requirement, interpretation, directive, guideline, decision or request pursuant to which such Lender Party would be entitled to request any payments under any of Sections 3.3 , 3.4 , 3.5 , 3.6 and 3.7 to or for account of such Lender Party.

 (i) Subject to Section 2.17, each Borrowing shall be comprised (i) in the case of Borrowings in Dollars, entirely of ABR Advances or SOFR Advances, (ii) in the case of Borrowings in Sterling, entirely of RFR Advances and (iii) in the case of Borrowings in Euro, entirely EURIBOR Advances, as the Borrower may request in accordance herewith.

No replacement of a Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement pursuant to this Section 2.17.3(a) will occur prior to the applicable Benchmark Transition Start Date. 
 (b) In connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have the right, in consultation with the Borrower and the Borrower, to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become

 (d) impose on any Lender Party any other condition affecting its commitment to lend or to issue or participate in Letters of Credit hereunder, and the result of any of the foregoing is either (i) to increase the cost to such Lender Party of making Advances or of issuing or participating in Letters of Credit or maintaining its Commitment or any part thereof, (ii) to reduce the amount of any payment received by such Lender Party or its effective return hereunder or on its capital or (iii) to cause such Lender Party to make any payment or to forego any return based on any amount received or receivable by such Lender Party hereunder, then and in any such case if such increase or reduction in the opinion of such Lender Party materially affects the interests of such Lender Party, (A) the Lender Party concerned shall (through the Administrative Agent) notify the Borrower of the occurrence of such event and use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different lending office if the making of such a designation would avoid the effects of such law, regulation or regulatory requirement or any change therein or in the interpretation thereof and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender Party, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender Party and (B) the Borrower shall forthwith upon demand pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender Party such amount as is necessary to compensate such Lender Party for such additional cost or such reduction and ancillary expenses, including taxes, incurred as a result of such adjustment. Such notice shall (i) describe in reasonable detail the event leading to such additional cost, together with the approximate date of the effectiveness thereof, (ii) set forth the amount of such additional cost, (iii) describe the manner in which such amount has been calculated, (iv) certify that the method used to calculate such amount is the Lender Party s standard method of calculating such amount, (v) certify that such request is consistent with its treatment of other borrowers that are subject to similar provisions, and (vi) certify that, to the best of its knowledge, such change in circumstance is of general application to the commercial banking industry in such Lender Party s jurisdiction of organization or in the relevant jurisdiction in which such Lender Party does business.

 Section 3.4 Funding Losses . In the event any Lender shall incur any loss or expense (other than loss of profits, business or anticipated savings) by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to make, continue or maintain any portion of the principal amount of any Advance as a SOFR Advance as a result of 
 (a) any conversion or repayment or prepayment of the principal amount of any SOFR Advances on a date other than the scheduled last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, whether pursuant to Section 3.1 or otherwise or 
 55 

(b) any SOFR Advances not being made in accordance with the Notice of Revolving Credit Borrowing therefor due to the fault of the Borrower or as a result of any of the conditions precedent set forth in Article IV not being satisfied, then, upon the written notice of such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall, within five Business Days of its receipt thereof, pay directly to such Lender such amount as will reimburse such Lender for such loss or expense.

 Section 3.5 Increased Capital Costs . If any change in, or the introduction, adoption, effectiveness, interpretation, reinterpretation or phase-in of, any law or regulation, directive, guideline, decision or request (whether or not having the force of law and for the avoidance of doubt, including any changes resulting from (i) requests, rules, guidelines or directives concerning capital adequacy or liquidity issued in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and (ii) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, and in each case for both clauses (i) and (ii), regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued) of any court, central bank, regulator or other governmental authority increases the amount of capital required to be maintained by any Lender Party or any Person controlling such Lender Party, and the rate of return on its or such controlling Person s capital as a consequence of its Commitments or the Advances made by such Lender Party is reduced to a level below that which such Lender Party or such controlling Person would have achieved but for the occurrence of any such change in circumstance, then, in any such case upon notice from time to time by such Lender Party to the Borrower, the Borrower shall immediately pay directly to such Lender Party additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender Party or such controlling Person for such reduction in rate of return. Any such notice shall (i) describe in reasonable detail the capital adequacy or liquidity requirements which have been imposed, together with the approximate date of the effectiveness thereof, (ii) set forth the amount of such lowered return, (iii) describe the manner in which such amount has been calculated, (iv) certify that the method used to calculate such amount is such Lender Party s standard method of calculating such amount, (v) certify that such request for such additional amounts is consistent with its treatment of other borrowers that are subject to similar provisions and (vi) certify that, to the best of its knowledge, such change in circumstances is of general application to the commercial banking industry in the jurisdictions in which such Lender Party does business. In determining such amount, such Lender Party may use any method of averaging and attribution that it shall, subject to the foregoing sentence, deem applicable. Each Lender Party agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different lending office if the making of such a designation would avoid such reduction in such rate of return and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender Party, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender Party. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender Party to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender Party s right to demand such compensation provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender Party pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than three months prior to the date that such Lender Party notifies the Borrower of the circumstance giving rise to such reductions and of such Lender Party s intention to claim compensation therefor provided , further , that, if the circumstance giving rise to such reductions is retroactive, then the three-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof, but not more than six months prior to the date that such Lender Party notifies the Borrower of the circumstance giving rise to such reductions and of such Lender Party s intention to claim compensation therefor. 
 Section 3.6 Taxes . All payments by the Borrower of principal of, and interest on, the Advances and all other amounts payable hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without 
 56 

deduction for any present or future income, excise, stamp or franchise taxes and other taxes, fees, duties, withholdings or other charges of any nature whatsoever imposed by any taxing authority, but excluding, with respect to each Lender Party, taxes imposed on or measured by such Lender Party s net income or receipts and franchise taxes imposed in lieu of net income taxes or taxes on receipts, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender Party is organized or any political subdivision thereof or the jurisdiction of such Lender Party s lending office or any political subdivision thereof or any other jurisdiction unless such net income taxes are imposed solely as a result of the Borrower s activities in such other jurisdiction, and any taxes imposed under FATCA (such non-excluded items being called Taxes ). In the event that any withholding or deduction from any payment to be made by the Borrower hereunder is required in respect of any Taxes pursuant to any applicable law, rule or regulation, then the Borrower will 
 (a) pay directly to the relevant authority the full amount required to be so withheld or deducted 
 (b) promptly forward to the Administrative Agent an official receipt or other documentation satisfactory to the Administrative Agent evidencing such payment to such authority and 
 (c) pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lender Parties such additional amount or amounts as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by each Lender Party will equal the full amount such Lender Party would have received had no such withholding or deduction been required. 
 Moreover, if any Taxes are directly asserted against the Administrative Agent or any Lender Party with respect to any payment received by the Administrative Agent or such Lender Party hereunder, the Administrative Agent or such Lender Party may pay such Taxes and the Borrower will promptly pay such additional amounts (including any penalties, interest or expenses) as is necessary in order that the net amount received by such Person after the payment of such Taxes (including any Taxes on such additional amount) shall equal the amount such Person would have received had no such Taxes been asserted. 
 Any Lender Party claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its lending office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender Party, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender Party.

 (i) the principal amount of such SOFR Advance outstanding on such day and 
 (ii) the remainder of (x) a fraction the numerator of which is the rate (expressed as a decimal) at which interest accrues on such SOFR Advance for such Interest Period as provided in this Agreement (less the Applicable Margin applicable to the relevant SOFR Advances and the relevant Applicable Percentage) and the denominator of which is one minus any increase after the Effective Date in the effective rate (expressed as a decimal) at which such reserve requirements are imposed on such Lender minus (y) such numerator and 
 58 

(iii) 1 360.

 Each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to avoid the requirement of maintaining such reserves (including by designating a different lending office) if such efforts would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

Each Lender Party represents and warrants to the Borrower that, as of the date of this Agreement (or, with respect to any Lender Party not a party hereto on the date hereof, on the date that such Lender Party becomes a party hereto), there is no existing treaty, law, regulation, regulatory requirement, interpretation, directive, guideline, decision or request pursuant to which such Lender Party would be entitled to request any payments under any of Sections 3.3 , 3.4 , 3.5 , 3.6 and 3.7 to or for account of such Lender Party.

 (b) Each Lender hereby severally indemnifies the Issuing Banks (to the extent not promptly reimbursed by the Borrower) from and against such Lender s Ratable Share of any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against any such Issuing Bank in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by such Issuing Bank hereunder or in connection herewith provided , however , that no Lender (in such capacity) shall be liable for any portion of such claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses resulting from such Issuing Bank s gross negligence or willful misconduct.

 Re Form 10-K for Year Ended December 31, 2022 
 
 Dear Sirs and Mesdames 
 
 You have asked for our opinion on certain U.S. Federal tax matters relating to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. For purposes of rendering our opinion, we have, when relevant facts were not independently established, relied upon information provided by representatives of the Company. 
 
 Certain Factual Assumptions 
 
 In issuing our opinion, we have relied upon representations and or publicly available information that 
 
 (1) the Company and its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries that own, charter or operate a ship or ships consist of 
 
 (a) corporations formed under the laws of Liberia 
 
 (b) a United Kingdom company (the UK Disregarded Entity for which a valid and timely election has been filed with the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS on Form 8832 to be classified as a disregarded entity for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, and the equity interests in which are owned entirely by the Company 
 
 (c) an Ecuadorean corporation (the Ecuador Subsidiary that owns and operates a ship used for Galapagos Islands cruises that are conducted entirely outside the United States and 
 
 (d) Silversea Cruise Holding Ltd., a Bahamian company, and wholly- owned direct and indirect subsidiaries of it (collectively, the Silversea Entities ), most of which subsidiaries are also Bahamian companies 
 
 (2) valid and timely elections have been filed with the IRS on Forms 8832 to cause each of the Silversea Entities with U.S.-source income to be classified as a disregarded entity for 
 U.S. Federal income tax purposes 
 US.354935460.05 

Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. February 9, 2023 
 Page 2 

(3) the common stock of the Company is the Company s only outstanding class of stock, and there are currently more than 255 million common shares outstanding 1 
 (4) all outstanding shares of common stock of the Company are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE ), where those shares are regularly quoted by dealers making a market in the stock (by regularly and actively offering to make, and making, purchases and sales of such shares in the ordinary course of business to and from customers who are not related persons with respect to the dealers), and Company shares are not traded on any non-U.S. securities market 
 
 (5) trades of Company common stock are effected on the NYSE in other than de minimis quantities on at least 60 days during each year, and the aggregate number of such shares traded on the NYSE each year equals or exceeds 10 of the average number of shares of Company common stock outstanding during the year 
 
 (6) the NYSE is a national securities exchange that is registered under section 6 of the Securities Act of 1934 
 
 (7) more than 50 of the outstanding shares of Company common stock are (and will be for at least 183 days during the current year) owned by persons each of whom owns less than 5 of such outstanding shares (treating as one person for this purpose any two or more persons who are related within the meaning of section 267(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code )), 2 and no such shares (or any shares of a subsidiary of the Company) are in bearer form 
 
 (8) the Company s certificate of incorporation precludes any person from acquiring more than 4.9 of the outstanding shares of Company s common stock (treating as one person for this purpose any two or more persons who are related within the meaning of Code section 267(b)), except that this restriction does not apply to existing 5 shareholders of the Company and may not apply, under Liberian law, to shares that were not voted in favor of the adoption of such restriction and 
 
 (9) the Company and each relevant subsidiary will comply with all applicable substantiation and reporting requirements set forth in Treasury Regulation 1.883-1(c)(3), 1.883- 2(e) and (f), and 1.883-4(d). 
 
 Discussion 
 
 Under Code section 883, certain foreign corporations are exempt from U.S. Federal income tax and branch profits tax on income derived from or incidental to the international 

1 T he Company also has outstanding certain convertible senior notes issued in June 2020, October 2020 and August 2022, which are properly treated as debt rather than equity for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. 
 
 2 Code 267(b) describes a number of relationships between two or more persons, including members of the same family, a grantor and a fiduciary of a trust, a fiduciary and a beneficiary of a trust, and various other relationships between individuals and entities and between entities. Additional attribution rules applicable under Code 267(b) are set forth in Code 267(c).

operation of a ship or ships, including income from the leasing of such ships. Thus, Code section 883(a) provides, in relevant part, that such international shipping income shall not be included in gross income of such a corporation and shall be exempt from taxation under this subtitle which is the subtitle regarding income taxes. 
 
 A foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of section 883 if, in relevant part, 
 (1) the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the United States, and (2) (a) more than 50 of the value of the corporation s capital stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by individuals who are residents of a foreign country or countries that grant such an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the United States or (b) the stock of the corporation is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States or another qualifying country. 3 If the stock of a parent corporation meets the test of clause (2)(b), then any stock of a direct or indirect subsidiary is treated for purposes of clause (2)(a) as if it were owned by individual residents of the country of incorporation of the parent corporation. 4 
 The Company and each direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary that owns, charters or operates a ship or ships that generates U.S.-source international shipping income will meet the requirements of clause (1) above because Liberia is a country that grants an equivalent exemption for all relevant categories of international shipping income. 5 For this purpose, the Company will be treated as the owner or operator of all ships owned or operated by the UK Disregarded Entity and likewise for all ships owned or operated by the Silversea Entities. 6 Lastly, the vessel owned and operated by the Ecuador Subsidiary does not visit U.S. ports, or otherwise operate in U.S. waters, so the Ecuador Subsidiary will have no U.S.-source shipping income. 7 
 With respect to the requirements of clause (2)(b) above, regulations and other guidance under Code section 883 set forth the tests applicable to determine whether a corporation s shares of stock should be considered primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States or another qualifying country. One or more classes of stock of the corporation that, in the aggregate, represent more than 50 of the vote and value of the stock of

 5 Rev. Rul. 2008-17, 2008-1 C.B. 626 see Exchange of Notes Between Liberia Ministry of Foreign Affairs, dated Oct. 7, 1987, and U.S. Embassy, Monrovia, Liberia, dated Oct. 23, 1987, reprinted at 1988-1 C.B. 463 Exchange of Notes Between Liberia Ministry of Foreign Affairs, dated Dec. 9, 2004, and U.S. Embassy, Monrovia, Liberia, dated June 4, 2005. 
 6 The Silversea Entities that are Bahamian companies would also meet the requirements of clause (1) even if they were corporations for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, because the Bahamas is a country that grants an equivalent exemption for all relevant categories of international shipping income. Rev. Rul. 2008-17, 2008-1 C.B. 626 see Exchange of Notes between Department of State, Washington D.C., dated June 26, 1987, and Embassy of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, Washington, D.C., dated July 16, 1987, reprinted at 1988-1 C.B. 458. 
 
 7 Code 863(c). An Ecuador corporation may also qualify for the equivalent exemption. According to Rev. Rul. 2008-17, the internal tax law of Ecuador provides an equivalent exemption for international shipping income, based on the IRS s review of Ecuador tax law as of December 1989. Thus, unless that aspect of Ecuador tax law has changed in the interim, the Ecuador Subsidiary would be eligible for the benefits of 883 were it to have any U.S- source international shipping income.

the corporation must be listed on such a market and must meet the applicable tests for being primarily and regularly traded on such market. 8 
 The Company s common shares are traded on an established securities market in the United States. The NYSE constitutes an established securities market for purposes of section 883 because it is a national securities exchange that is registered under section 6 of the Securities Act of 1934. 9 The Company s common stock is its only class of outstanding equity as a legal and Federal tax matter. 
 
 The Company s shares are considered primarily traded on an established securities market in the United States, because they are traded on the NYSE and are not traded on any securities market in any other country. 10 
 Stock will generally be considered regularly traded on a securities market if trades in more than de minimis quantities occur on the market on at least sixty days of the year, and the annual trading volume on the market equals or exceeds 10 of the outstanding shares. 11 The Company s shares meet this test with respect to the NYSE. The Company s shares also meet an alternative basis for such a conclusion with respect to the NYSE, inasmuch as the stock is regularly quoted by dealers making a market in the stock. 12 
 If, for at least half the number of days in the year, 50 or more of a corporation s outstanding shares are owned by 5 or greater shareholders other than registered investment companies (a closely-held group ), the regulations under Code section 883 provide that the shares generally will fail to be treated as regularly traded unless the corporation can identify sufficient qualified direct or indirect shareholders within the closely-held group as to reduce to 50 or less the aggregate shares owned by the closely-held group that are not owned, directly or indirectly, by qualified shareholders. 13 Less than 50 of the Company s outstanding shares are owned by such 5 or greater shareholders, so the Company is not disqualified by reason of the closely-held exception. The restriction in the Company s certificate of incorporation described in paragraph (8) above is designed to ensure that this will continue to be the case. 
 
 So long as the Company meets the requirements of clause (2)(b) above, then each subsidiary in which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50 of the value of the stock, and that meets the requirements of clause (1) above, will be treated as meeting the requirements of clause (2)(a) above. 
 
 As noted above, section 883(a) provides that the international shipping income of a qualified foreign corporation shall not be included in gross income and shall be exempt from taxation under this subtitle. Section 883 is contained in subtitle A of the Code, which is entitled

 10 Treas. Reg. 1.883-2(c). 
 11 Treas. Reg. 1.883-2(d)(1)(ii).

INCOME TAXES and encompasses Code sections 1 through 1563. Thus, the plain language of section 883 provides that no tax imposed by any of those sections should apply to international shipping income that is covered by section 883. 
 
 Conclusion 
 
 Based upon, and subject to the factual representations and assumptions described above, and the legal authorities and limitations set forth below, it is our opinion that the income derived from a U.S. trade or business and or from sources within the United States by the Company, and by its subsidiaries that own or operate a ship or ships, is excluded from gross income and exempt from taxation for U.S. Federal income tax purposes pursuant to Code section 883 to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships. 

This opinion represents our best legal judgment, but it has no binding effect or official status of any kind, and no assurance can be given that contrary positions may not be taken by the IRS or a court considering the issues. We express no opinion relating to any Federal income tax matter except on the basis of the facts described above, and any changes in such facts could require a reconsideration and modification of our opinion. We also express no opinion regarding tax consequences under foreign, state or local laws. In issuing our opinion, we have relied solely upon existing provisions of the Code, existing and proposed regulations under it, and current administrative positions and other authorities. Those laws, regulations, administrative positions and other authorities are subject to change at any time. Any such changes could affect the validity of the opinion set forth above. Also, future changes in Federal tax laws and the interpretation thereof can have retroactive effect. 
 
 Our firm includes lawyers admitted to practice in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the States of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Texas, the District of Columbia, the United Kingdom and China. We do not purport to be experts in the laws of any other jurisdiction, aside from U.S. Federal law.
