 Overview 
 Richmond Mutual Bancorporation, Inc., a Maryland corporation, which is sometimes referred to in this document as Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Maryland, was formed in February 2019 to serve as a new stock holding company for First Bank Richmond upon completion of the reorganization of First Bank Richmond from the mutual to stock holding company form of organization. The reorganization was completed on July 1, 2019. Prior to completion of the reorganization, First Bank Richmond was a wholly owned subsidiary of Richmond Mutual Bancorporation, Inc., a Delaware stock corporation, which is sometimes referred to in this document as Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Delaware, and Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Delaware was a wholly owned subsidiary of First Mutual of Richmond, Inc., a Delaware non-stock mutual holding company (the MHC ). On July 1, 2019, upon the completion of the reorganization, Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Delaware and the MHC ceased to exist, and First Bank Richmond became a wholly owned subsidiary of Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Maryland. In certain circumstances, where appropriate, the terms Richmond Mutual Bancorporation, the Company, we, us and our refer collectively to (i) Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Delaware and First Bank Richmond with respect to discussions in this document involving matters occurring prior to completion of the reorganization and (ii) Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Maryland and First Bank Richmond with respect to discussions in this document involving matters to occur post-reorganization, in each case unless the context indicates another meaning. 
 On February 6, 2019, the Board of Directors of the MHC, the parent mutual holding company of Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Delaware, adopted a Plan of Reorganization and Stock Offering (the Plan ). The Plan was approved by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve Board and by the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions (the IDFI ), as well as the voting members of the MHC at a special meeting of members held on June 19, 2019. Pursuant to the Plan, upon completion of the transaction, the MHC would convert from a mutual holding company to the stock holding company corporate structure, the MHC and Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Delaware would cease to exist, and First Bank Richmond would become a wholly owned subsidiary Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Maryland. The transaction was completed on July 1, 2019. In connection with the related stock offering, which was also completed on July 1, 2019, Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Maryland sold 13,026,625 shares of common stock at 10.00 per share, for gross offering proceeds of approximately 130.3 million in its subscription offering and contributed 500,000 shares and 1.25 million to a newly formed charitable foundation, the First Bank Richmond, Inc. Community Foundation (the Foundation ). 
 Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Maryland is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board. Our corporate office is located at 31 North 9th Street, Richmond, Indiana, and our telephone number is (765) 962-2581. 
 First Bank Richmond is an Indiana state-chartered commercial bank headquartered in Richmond, Indiana. The bank was originally established in 1887 as an Indiana state-chartered mutual savings and loan association and in 1935 converted to a federal mutual savings and loan association, operating under the name First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Richmond. In 1993, the bank converted to a state-chartered mutual savings bank and changed its name to First Bank Richmond, S.B. In 1998, the bank, in connection with its non-stock mutual holding company reorganization, converted to a national bank charter operating as First Bank Richmond, National Association. In July 2007, Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Delaware, the bank s then current holding company, acquired Mutual Federal Savings Bank headquartered in Sidney, Ohio. Mutual Federal Savings Bank was operated independently as a separately chartered, wholly owned subsidiary of Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Delaware until 2016 when it was combined with the bank through an internal merger transaction that consolidated both banks into a single, more efficient commercial bank charter. In 2017, the bank converted to an Indiana state-chartered commercial bank and changed its name to First Bank Richmond. The former Mutual Federal Savings Bank continues to operate in Ohio under the name Mutual Federal, a division of First Bank Richmond. 
 First Bank Richmond provides full banking services through its seven full- and one limited-service offices located in Cambridge City (1), Centerville (1), Richmond (5) and Shelbyville (1), Indiana, its five full-service offices located in Piqua (2), Sidney (2) and Troy (1), Ohio, and its loan production office in Columbus, Ohio. Administrative, trust and wealth management services are conducted through First Bank Richmond s Corporate Office/Financial Center located in Richmond, Indiana. As an Indiana-chartered commercial bank, First Bank Richmond is subject to regulation by the IDFI and the FDIC.

Our principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public, as well as brokered deposits, and investing those funds primarily in loans secured by commercial and multi-family real estate, first mortgages on owner-occupied, one- to four-family residences, a variety of consumer loans, direct financing leases and commercial and industrial loans. We also obtain funds by utilizing Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB advances. Funds not invested in loans generally are invested in investment securities, including mortgage-backed and mortgage-related securities and agency and municipal bonds. 
 First Bank Richmond generates commercial, mortgage and consumer loans and leases and receives deposits from customers located primarily in Wayne and Shelby Counties, in Indiana and Shelby, Miami and Franklin (no deposits) Counties, in Ohio. We sometimes refer to these counties as our primary market area. First Bank Richmond s loans are generally secured by specific items of collateral including real property, consumer assets and business assets. Our leasing operation consists of direct investments in equipment that we lease (referred to as direct finance leases) to small businesses located throughout the United States. Our lease portfolio consists of various kinds of equipment, generally technology-related, such as computer systems, medical equipment and general manufacturing, industrial, construction and transportation equipment. We seek leasing transactions where we believe the equipment leased is integral to the lessee's business. We also provide trust and wealth management services, including serving as executor and trustee under wills and deeds and as guardian and custodian of employee benefits, and manage private investment accounts for individuals and institutions. Total wealth management assets under management and administration were 138.8 million at December 31, 2022. 
 Our results of operations are primarily dependent on net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, which is the income that is earned on loans and investments, and interest expense, which is the interest that is paid on deposits and borrowings. Other significant sources of pre-tax income are service charges (mostly from service charges on deposit accounts and loan servicing fees), and fees from sale of residential mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary market. We also recognize income from the sale of investment securities. 
 First Insurance Management, Inc., a Nevada corporation, was formed in 2022 as a pooled captive insurance company subsidiary of the Company. The purpose of this company is to provide additional property and casualty insurance coverage to the Company and its subsidiaries and reinsurance to 16 other third party insurance captives for which insurance may not be currently available or economically feasible in today's insurance marketplace. 
 
 FB Richmond Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation, was formed in 2020 as a subsidiary of First Bank Richmond. FB Richmond Holdings holds substantially all of the Bank s investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2022, the market value of securities held was 290.6 million. 
 
 FB Richmond Properties, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed in 2020 as a subsidiary of FB Richmond Holdings, Inc. FB Richmond Properties holds certain residential mortgages and commercial real estate loans. As of December 31, 2022, FB Richmond Properties held approximately 101.8 million in residential mortgages and commercial real estate loans. 
 At December 31, 2022, on a consolidated basis, we had 1.3 billion in assets, 961.7 million in loans and leases, net of allowance, 1.0 billion in deposits and 133.0 million in stockholders equity. At December 31, 2022, First Bank Richmond s total risk-based capital ratio was 14.3 , exceeding the 10.0 requirement for a well-capitalized institution. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we reported net income of 13.0 million, compared to net income of 11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

 Lending Activities 
 We offer a full range of lending products, including multi-family and commercial real estate loans (including owner and nonowner-occupied real estate loans), commercial and industrial loans (including equipment loans and working capital lines of credit), construction and development loans, residential real estate loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, and consumer loans. We also engage in lease financing which consists of direct financing leases and is used by our commercial customers to finance purchases of equipment. We offer consumer loans, predominantly as an accommodation to our customers, secured by personal assets such as automobiles or recreational vehicles. Some consumer loans are unsecured, such as small installment loans and certain lines of credit. Lending activities originate from the relationships and efforts of our bankers. 
 Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. Pursuant to Indiana law, the aggregate amount of loans that First Bank Richmond is permitted to make to any one borrower, or a group of related borrowers, is generally limited to 15 of First Bank Richmond s unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, up to 10 of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. At December 31, 2022, based on the 15 limitation, First Bank Richmond s loans-to-one-borrower limit was approximately 24.7 million. As of December 31, 2022, First Bank Richmond was in compliance with the loans-to-one-borrower limitations. At December 31, 2022, our largest lending relationship with one borrower was for 17.3 million consisting of four commercial real estate loans secured by properties in the Columbus, Ohio area. All of these loans were performing in accordance with their repayment terms at December 31, 2022. 
 Our lending is subject to written underwriting standards and origination procedures set forth in First Bank Richmond s loan policy. Decisions on loan applications are made on the basis of detailed information submitted by the prospective borrower, credit histories that we obtain, and property valuations (consistent with our appraisal policy) prepared by outside independent licensed appraisers approved by our board of directors as well as internal evaluations, where permitted by regulations. The loan information is primarily designed to determine the borrower s ability to repay the requested loan, and the more significant items are verified through use of credit reports, bank statements and tax returns. Loans containing a policy exception have the exception noted in the credit file accompanied by a statement as to the reason for granting the exception. Exceptions must be approved in accordance with First Bank Richmond s loan policy. All loan approval amounts are based on the aggregate debt, including total commitments outstanding and the proposed loan to the individual borrower and any related entity. 
 First Bank Richmond s board of directors has the responsibility for approving, on an annual basis, specific lending authority for individual officers, combinations of officers, or loan committees. 
 Loan Maturity and Repricing. The following tables set forth certain information at December 31, 2022 regarding the dollar amount of loans maturing in our portfolio based on their contractual terms to maturity, but does not include scheduled payments or potential prepayments. Loans with scheduled maturities are reported in the maturity category in which the loan is due. Loans that have adjustable rates are shown as amortizing to final maturity rather than when the interest rates are next subject to change. Loan balances do not include undisbursed loan proceeds, unearned discounts, unearned income and allowance for loan and lease losses.

 Residential Mortgage Lending . We make one- to four-family residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit secured by the borrower s primary residence. In addition, we may periodically purchase residential loans, which we refer to as brokered mortgages, primarily during periods of reduced loan demand in our primary market areas and at times to support our Community Reinvestment Act lending activities, although we have not purchased any brokered mortgage loans in the last eight years. Any such purchases are made generally consistent with our underwriting standards for residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2022, 157.1 million, or 16.1 , of our total loan and lease portfolio was secured by residential real estate, consisting of 141.4 million of one- to four-family residential real estate loans, 4.7 million of home equity loans, and 11.0 million of home equity lines of credit. 
 We originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans. At December 31, 2022, 57.4 of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans were fixed-rate loans and 42.6 of such loans were adjustable-rate loans. Most of our loans are underwritten using generally-accepted secondary market underwriting guidelines. We typically sell most of the conforming, fixed-rate one- to four-family loans we originate into the secondary market to Fannie Mae and, to a lesser extent, the FHLB of Indianapolis. Loans that are sold into the secondary market to Fannie Mae or the FHLB of Indianapolis are sold with the servicing retained to maintain the client relationship and to generate non-interest income. The sale of mortgage loans provides a source of non-interest income through the gain on sale, reduces our interest rate risk, provides a stream of servicing income, enhances liquidity and enables us to originate more loans at our current capital level than if we held the loans in our loan portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we originated 41.3 million

one- to four-family fixed-rate mortgage loans and 24.0 million one- to four-family adjustable-rate mortgage ARM loans, and sold 28.1 million of these loans without recourse to Fannie Mae and the FHLB of Indianapolis. See - Originations, Sales and Purchases of Loans. 
 
 We also, from time to time, make a limited amount of Federal Housing Administration FHA loans, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs VA loans and U.S. Department of Agriculture USDA loans, all of which we originate for sale on a servicing-released, non-recourse basis in accordance with FHA, VA and USDA guidelines. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we did not originate or sell any FHA, VA or USDA loans, compared to 624,000 of FHA, VA and USDA loans originated and sold during the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Substantially all of the one- to four-family residential mortgage loans we retain in our portfolio consist of fixed-rate loans that do not satisfy acreage limits, income, credit, conforming loan limits (i.e., jumbo mortgages) or various other requirements imposed by Fannie Mae or are adjustable-rate loans. Some of these loans are also originated to meet the needs of borrowers who cannot otherwise satisfy Fannie Mae credit requirements because of personal and financial reasons (i.e., bankruptcy, length of time employed, etc.), and other aspects which do not conform to Fannie Mae s guidelines. Such borrowers may have higher debt-to-income ratios, or the loans are secured by unique properties in rural markets for which there are no sales of comparable properties to support the value according to secondary market requirements. We may require additional collateral or lower loan-to-value ratios to reduce the risk of these loans. We believe that these loans satisfy the needs of borrowers in our market area. As a result, subject to market conditions, we intend to continue to originate these types of loans. We also retain jumbo loans which exceed the conforming loan limits and therefore are not eligible to be purchased by Fannie Mae. At December 31, 2022, 46.6 million or 31.9 of our one- to four-family loan portfolio consisted of jumbo loans. 
 We generally underwrite our one- to four-family loans based on the applicant s employment and credit history and the appraised value of the subject property. We generally lend up to 89 of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price for one- to four-family first mortgage loans and non-owner occupied first mortgage loans. For first mortgage loans with a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 89 , we may require private mortgage insurance or other credit enhancement to help mitigate the risk. Fixed-rate loans secured by one- to four-family residences may have contractual maturities of up to 30 years. All of these loans are fully amortizing, with payments due monthly. Properties securing our one- to four-family loans are typically appraised by independent fee appraisers who are selected in accordance with criteria approved by the Loan Committee. For loans that are less than 250,000, we may use an automated valuation model, in lieu of an appraisal. We require title insurance policies on all first mortgage real estate loans originated over 100,000. Homeowners, liability, fire and, if required, flood insurance policies are also required for one-to four-family loans. Our real estate loans generally contain a due on sale clause allowing us to declare the unpaid principal balance due and payable upon the sale of the security property. 
 ARM loans are offered with annual adjustments and life-time rate caps that vary based on the product, generally with a maximum annual rate change of 2.0 and a maximum overall rate change of 6.0 . We generally use the rate on one-year Treasury Bills to re-price our ARM loans. As a consequence of using caps, the interest rates on ARM loans may not be as rate sensitive as our cost of funds. Furthermore, because loan indexes may not respond perfectly to changes in market interest rates, upward adjustments on loans may occur more slowly than increases in our cost of interest-bearing liabilities, especially during periods of rapidly increasing interest rates. Because of these characteristics, future yields on ARM loans may not be sufficient to offset increases in our cost of funds. 
 ARM loans generally pose different credit risks than fixed-rate loans, primarily because as interest rates rise, the borrower s payment increases, which increases the potential for default. We continue to offer our fully amortizing ARM loans with a fixed interest rate for the first one, three, five or seven years, followed by a periodic adjustable interest rate for the remaining term. 
 The average balance of our one- to four-family residential loans secured by first mortgages was approximately 125,000 at December 31, 2022. 
 We originate fixed-rate home equity loans and fixed- and variable-rate lines of credit secured either by a first or second lien on the borrower s primary residence. Our home equity loans are fixed rate fully amortizing loans with terms of up to 15 years and are generally originated in amounts, together with the amount of the existing first mortgage, of up to 89 of the appraised value of the subject property. Home equity loans originated with a loan to value ratio in excess of 80 are subject to a higher origination fee and higher interest rate than home equity loans with loan to value ratios of 80 or less. If the home equity loan is for home improvements, the improvements to be made to the property may be considered when calculating the loan to value ratio. If the loan to value ratio on the property is sufficient, regardless of the improvements to be made, the proceeds may be disbursed directly to the borrower. When the appraised value is dependent on the improvements to meet the 
 6 

loan to value requirement, the proceeds are held by us until we receive reasonable assurance that the improvements have been completed. The loan officers, at their discretion, may use a limited appraisal or a recertification of value on these types of loans. At December 31, 2022, home equity loans totaled 4.7 million, or 0.5 of our total loan and lease portfolio. 
 Home equity lines of credit may be either fixed- or adjustable-rate and are typically originated in amounts, together with the amount of the existing first mortgage, of up to 89 of the appraised value of the subject property. Home equity lines of credit originated with a loan to value ratio in excess of 80 are subject to a higher interest rate than home equity lines of credit with loan to value ratios of 80 or less. Home equity lines of credit with an adjustable rate of interest adjust quarterly and are based on the Wall Street Journal Prime rate, plus a margin . Our fixed rate lines have a five-year draw period and our adjustable-rate lines have a 10-year draw period, during which time the funds may be paid down and redrawn up to the committed amount. Once the draw period has lapsed, the borrower either pays off the loan balance, or a new loan is negotiated. We charge an annual fee on each home equity line of credit and require a monthly payment of 0.9 of the outstanding balance drawn during the period, plus interest. At December 31, 2022, home equity lines of credit totaled 11.0 million, or 1.1 of our total loan and lease portfolio, with adjustable-rate home equity lines of credit totaling 7.9 million and fixed rate home equity lines making up the remaining balance. At December 31, 2022, unfunded commitments on home equity lines of credit totaled 16.8 million. 
 We do not engage in originating interest only, negative amortization, option adjustable rate or subprime loans and have no established program to originate or purchase these loans. Subprime loans are defined as loans that at the time of loan origination had a FICO credit score of less than 660. Of the 157.1 million in one- to four- family loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, in our portfolio as of December 31, 2022, 12.3 million, or 7.8 , were to borrowers with a credit score under 660. 
 Multi-family and Commercial Real Estate Lending . We originate commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by multi-family residential properties, office buildings, hotels, industrial properties, retail buildings, medical and professional buildings, restaurants and various other commercial properties located principally in our primary market area. As of December 31, 2022, 423.0 million or 43.4 of our total loan and lease portfolio was secured by commercial and multi-family real estate, of which 154.5 million, or 15.8 of our total loan and lease portfolio, was secured by property located in the Columbus, Ohio market. Multi-family loans totaled 124.9 million of the 423.0 million commercial and multi-family real estate loan portfolio, or 12.8 of our total loan and lease portfolio, at December 31, 2022. Of the remaining 298.1 million of this portfolio, approximately 140.0 million was secured by income producing, or non-owner-occupied commercial real estate. We also purchase and participate, from time to time, in multi-family and commercial real estate loans from other financial institutions, which amounts are included in our multi-family and commercial real estate loan portfolios. Such loans are independently underwritten according to our policies. At December 31, 2022, our purchased multi-family and commercial real estate loan participations totaled 40.9 million, or 9.7 of our total multi-family and commercial real estate loan portfolios. 
 Multi-family and commercial real estate loans generally are priced at a higher rate of interest than one- to four-family residential loans. Typically, these loans have higher loan balances, are more difficult to evaluate and monitor, and involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential loans. Often payments on loans secured by commercial or multi-family properties are dependent on the successful operation and management of the property; therefore, repayment of these loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. We generally require and obtain loan guarantees from financially capable parties based upon the review of personal financial statements. If the borrower is a corporation, we generally require and obtain personal guarantees from the corporate principals based upon a review of their personal financial statements and individual credit reports. In addition, the borrower s and guarantor s financial information on such loans is monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring periodic financial statements. 
 Our commercial and multi-family real estate loans generally have initial terms of 10 to 20 years and amortization terms of up to 25 years, with a balloon payment at the end of the initial term and may be fixed-rate or adjustable-rate loans. Our adjustable-rate multi-family and commercial real estate loans are generally tied to a margin above the prime rate or the applicable treasury rate. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of our multi-family and commercial real estate loans is generally 80 of the lower of cost or appraised value of the property securing the loan. At December 31, 2022, 17.4 of our multi-family and commercial real estate loans were fixed-rate loans and 82.6 were adjustable-rate loans. 
 We consider a number of factors in originating multi-family and commercial real estate loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including project-level and global cash flows, credit history and management expertise, as well as the value and condition of the property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower s payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors we consider include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of 
 7 

net operating income to debt service). We generally require a debt service ratio of at least 1.10x. All multi-family and commercial real estate loans in excess of 500,000 are appraised by outside independent appraisers. We require property and casualty insurance and also require flood insurance if the property is determined to be in a flood zone area. 
 In addition, we generally require a Phase I Environmental Audit as a condition of making all multi-family and commercial real estate loans in excess of 1.0 million, which audit is performed by a qualified environmental consulting firm. The Phase I Environmental Audit includes appropriate inquiry into previous ownership and uses of the real estate to satisfactorily comply with the Innocent Landowner Defense Amendment to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA). The results and recommendations of the audit must be acceptable to us prior to loan closing. For loans less than 1.0 million but greater than 150,000, a full Phase I Environmental Audit is not required, although an environmental investigation is typically performed by qualified bank personnel or a third party to determine if a full Phase I Environmental Audit should be done. 
 At December 31, 2022, the average loan size of our outstanding multi-family and commercial real estate loans was 1.1 million, and the largest of such loans was a 11.8 million loan secured by a first mortgage on a parking garage and apartment building located in the Columbus, Ohio metropolitan area. This loan was performing in accordance with its repayment terms at December 31, 2022. We had 44 other commercial and multi-family real estate loans with an outstanding balance in excess of 3.0 million at December 31, 2022, all of which were performing in accordance with their repayment terms at December 31, 2022. Our largest lending relationship with one borrower at December 31, 2022 was for 26.4 million consisting of seven commercial real estate loans secured by six separate hotels, three in the Dayton, Ohio area, one in the Columbus, Ohio area and two in the Cincinnati, Ohio area, all with a common guarantor. All of these loans were performing in accordance with their repayment terms at December 31, 2022. 
 Multi-family and commercial real estate loans entail greater credit risks compared to one- to four-family residential real estate loans because they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the repayment of loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the property, as repayment of the loan generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the property to cover operating expenses and debt service. Changes in economic conditions that are not in the control of the borrower or lender could affect the value of the collateral for the loan or the future cash flow of the property. Additionally, any decline in real estate values may be more pronounced for multi-family and commercial real estate than residential properties. If we foreclose on a commercial or multi-family real estate loan, the marketing and liquidation period to convert the real estate asset to cash can be a lengthy process with substantial holding costs. In addition, vacancies, deferred maintenance, repairs and market stigma can result in prospective buyers expecting sale price concessions to offset their real or perceived economic losses for the time it takes them to return the property to profitability. Depending on the individual circumstances, initial charge-offs and subsequent losses on multi-family and commercial real estate loans can be unpredictable and substantial.

The composition of, and location of the underlying collateral securing, our multi-family and commercial real estate loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 was as follows:

 Commercial and Industrial Lending . We make secured and unsecured commercial and industrial loans, including commercial lines of credit, working capital loans, term loans, equipment financing, acquisition, expansion and development loans, letters of credit and other loan products, principally in our primary market area. These loans are made based primarily on historical and projected cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. We take as collateral a lien on general business assets including, among other things, available real estate, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment and generally obtain a personal guaranty of the borrower or principal. Our operating lines of credit typically are limited to a percentage of the value of the assets securing the line. Lines of credit and term loans typically are reviewed annually. As of December 31, 2022, we had 100.4 million of commercial and industrial loans, representing 10.3 of our total loan and lease portfolio, including 6.3 million of unsecured commercial and industrial loans (which includes Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") loans discussed below). 
 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 944,000 of loans originated under the PPP, a specialized low-interest loan program funded by the U.S. Treasury Department and administered by the Small Business Administration SBA ). The Bank, as a qualified SBA lender, was authorized to originate PPP loans. PPP loans have an interest rate of 1.0 , a two- year or five-year loan term to maturity, and principal and interest payments deferred until the lender receives the applicable forgiven amount or ten months after the end of the borrower s loan forgiveness covered period. The SBA guarantees 100 of the PPP loans made to eligible borrowers. The entire principal amount of the borrower s PPP loan, including any accrued interest, is eligible to be reduced by the loan forgiveness amount under the PPP so long as employee and compensation levels of the business are maintained and the loan proceeds are used for other qualifying expenses. The PPP expired on May 31, 2021. 
 The terms of our commercial and industrial loans, excluding PPP loans, vary by purpose and by type of underlying collateral. We typically make equipment loans for a term of five years or less at fixed or adjustable rates, with the loan fully amortized over the term. Terms greater than five years may be appropriate in some circumstances, based upon the useful life of the underlying asset being financed or if some form of credit enhancement, such as an SBA guarantee, is obtained. Loans to support working capital typically have terms not exceeding one year and are usually secured by accounts receivable, inventory and personal guarantees of the principals of the business. The interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk and loan amount and are further subject to competitive pressures, money market rates, the availability of funds and government regulations. For loans secured by accounts receivable and inventory, principal is typically repaid as the assets securing the loan are converted into cash (monitored on a monthly or more frequent basis as determined necessary in the underwriting process), and for loans secured with other types of collateral, principal is typically due at maturity. 
 In general, commercial and industrial loans may involve increased credit risk and, therefore, typically yield a higher return. The increased risk in commercial and industrial loans derives from the expectation that such loans generally are serviced principally from the operations of the business, and those operations may not be successful. Any interruption or discontinuance 
 9 

of operating cash flows from the business, which may be influenced by events not under the control of the borrower such as economic events and changes in governmental regulations, could materially affect the ability of the borrower to repay the loan. In addition, the collateral securing commercial and industrial loans generally includes moveable property such as equipment and inventory, which may decline in value more rapidly than we anticipate, exposing us to increased credit risk. As a result of these additional complexities, variables and risks, commercial and industrial loans require extensive underwriting and servicing. 
 At December 31, 2022, the average loan size of our outstanding commercial and industrial loans was 240,000, and our largest outstanding commercial and industrial loan was a capital improvement loan totaling 7.1 million to an equipment holding and leasing company located in Bremen, Ohio secured by a first lien on equipment. This loan was performing in accordance with its repayment terms at December 31, 2022. We had 20 other commercial and industrial loans with an outstanding balance in excess of 1.0 million at December 31, 2022, all but one of which were performing in accordance with their repayment terms at that date. 
 Construction and Development Lending. We originate loans to finance the construction of commercial real estate projects, such as multi-family housing, industrial, office and retail centers. We also originate residential construction loans to borrowers and builders secured by single-family residences. On a much smaller scale, we may originate loans for the acquisition and development of residential or commercial land into buildable lots. At December 31, 2022, our construction and development loan portfolio totaled 139.9 million, or 14.4 of our total loan and lease portfolio, consisting of 127.0 million in commercial construction loans and 12.9 million in residential construction loans. At December 31, 2022, we had unfunded construction loan commitments totaling 128.2 million and 17.7 million in commercial and residential construction loans, respectively. 
 Our commercial construction loans are typically made to builders/developers that have an established record of successful project completion and loan repayment. We conduct periodic inspections, either directly or through an agent, prior to approval of periodic draws on these loans based on the percentage of completion. Underwriting guidelines for our commercial construction loans are similar to those described above for our commercial real estate lending. General liability, builder s risk hazard insurance, title insurance, and flood insurance (as applicable, for properties located or to be built in a designated flood hazard area) are also required on all construction and development loans. 
 Our commercial construction loans have terms that typically range from one to two years depending on factors such as the type and size of the development and the financial strength of the borrower/guarantor. Commercial construction loans are typically structured with an interest only period during the construction phase. Commercial construction loans are underwritten to either mature, or transition to a traditional amortizing loan, at the completion of the construction phase. The loan-to-value ratio on our commercial construction loans, as established by independent appraisal, typically will not exceed 80 of the appraised value on a completed basis or the cost of completion, whichever is less. These loans generally include an interest reserve of 1 to 5 of the loan commitment amount. The average outstanding loan size in our commercial construction loan portfolio was approximately 2.3 million at December 31, 2022. 
 Commercial construction loans on property built for speculative purposes that has not sold in a period of eighteen months after completion will require re-margining at no more than 89 of current appraised value and monthly amortization based on a 25-year payout. At December 31, 2022, 20.8 million, or 16.4 , of our total commercial construction loan portfolio consisted of speculative construction loans. 
 We finance the construction of pre-sold owner occupied, one- to four-family residential properties in our market areas to builders and prospective homeowners. Our residential construction loans are originated primarily on a construction/permanent basis with such loans converting to an amortizing loan following the completion of the construction phase. Our residential construction loans generally provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which is typically up to nine months. We do not make speculative construction loans to a builder for homes that are not pre-sold. The average outstanding residential construction loan balance was approximately 267,000 at December 31, 2022. 
 Residential construction loans are made with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of the lower of 80 of the cost or appraised value at completion. Commitments to fund residential construction loans generally are made subject to an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. Loan proceeds are disbursed after inspection by a third-party inspector based on the percentage of completion method. 
 On a more limited basis, we also make land loans to developers, builders and individuals to finance the commercial development of improved lots or unimproved land. In making land loans, we follow underwriting policies and disbursement and monitoring procedures similar to those for commercial construction loans. These land loans also involve additional risks because the loan amount is based on the projected value of the lots after development. We make these loans for up to 65 of 
 10 

the estimated value of raw land and up to 75 of the estimated value of developed land, with a term of up to two years with interest only payments, payable monthly. 
 Construction loans generally involve greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner occupied real estate. In the event a loan is made on property that is not yet approved for the planned development or improvements, there is a risk that necessary approvals will not be granted or will be delayed. Risk of loss on a construction loan also depends upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction cost is inaccurate, we may be required to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Moreover, if the estimated value of the completed project is inaccurate, the borrower may hold a property with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the construction loan upon the sale of the property. Construction loans also carry the risk that construction will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs. In addition, repayment of these loans can be dependent on the sale or rental of the property to third parties, and the ultimate sale or rental of the property may not occur as anticipated. Other risks may include the fraudulent diversion of construction funds, the filing of mechanics liens by contractors, subcontractors or suppliers, or the contractor s failure to complete the construction of the project. 
 We seek to address the forgoing risks associated with construction and development lending by developing and adhering to underwriting policies, disbursement procedures and monitoring practices. Specifically, we (i) seek to diversify loans in our market areas, (ii) evaluate and document the creditworthiness of the borrower and the viability of the proposed project, (iii) obtain an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser, (iv) limit loan-to-value ratios to specified levels, (v) control disbursements on construction loans on the basis of on-site inspections by third party inspectors, and (vi) monitor economic conditions in each market. No assurances, however, can be given that these practices will be successful in mitigating the risks of construction and development lending. 
 At December 31, 2022, our largest construction and land development loan had an outstanding balance of 10.9 million and was secured by an apartment building located in Columbus, Ohio. At December 31, 2022, this loan was performing according to its repayment terms. We had 15 other construction and development loans with an outstanding balance in excess of 3.0 million at December 31, 2022, all of which were performing in accordance with their repayment terms at that date except for one 4.9 million loan that is subject to litigation between the developer and other parties. 
 
 Lease Financing. We conduct our leasing operations through First Federal Leasing, a division of First Bank Richmond. Our lease financing operation consists of direct financing leases which are used by commercial customers to finance purchases such as medical, computer and manufacturing equipment, audio/visual equipment, industrial assets, construction and transportation equipment, and a wide variety of other commercial equipment. We rely solely on brokers and other third-party originators to generate our lease transactions. The nature of our business requires the use of brokers and third-party originators as it focuses on transactions generally ranging between 2,500 and 200,000 (with an average size of 45,000) with terms of 24 to 72 months, with a weighted average term of 41.7 months as of December 31, 2022. Our risk management profile centers on internally rated A quality credits. At December 31, 2022, our direct finance leasing portfolio totaled 133.5 million, or 13.7 of our total loan and lease portfolio, with lease contracts located throughout the United States. 
 At lease inception, we record an asset (net investment) representing the aggregate future minimum lease payments and deferred indirect costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate a level rate of return on the net investment. 
 To generate deal flow, we actively work with over 100 brokers and third-party originators across the country, some of which are one person shops and others more established companies, with most of the volume coming from fewer than 25 referral sources. We have operated with this model since we commenced leasing operations in 1989 and have developed procedures to minimize fraud and concentration risk. The leases are processed by us through our lease origination software, which allows brokers to populate the fields with customer information and attach credit documentation, streamlining the data collection process. There is no automated approval process. Each lease application is reviewed by a credit administrator and then sent to a credit underwriter for review and approval. We have procedures in place to check and underwrite all the data we receive from the brokers and third-party originators, including ensuring that the potential lessee is operating from the location given and tracking the performance of each vendor. 
 The credit decisions for these transactions are based upon an assessment of the overall financial capacity of the applicant and generally require that the applicant have a minimum FICO score of 675. A determination is made as to the applicant s ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms as well as an overall assessment of the risks involved. In addition to an evaluation of the applicant s financial condition, a determination is made of the probable adequacy of the primary 
 11 

and secondary sources of repayment, such as personal guarantees, to be relied upon in the transaction. Credit agency reports of the applicant s credit history supplement the analysis of the applicant s creditworthiness. 
 We generally file a UCC-1 financing statement on all of our lease transaction to perfect our interest in the equipment, except in the case of (i) titled equipment, where we would require the title in lieu of the UCC financing statement, (ii) transactions under 5,000 or (iii) for equipment with very little value, such as computer software. Perfection gives us a claim to the collateral that is superior to someone that obtains a lien through the judicial process subsequent to the perfection of a security interest. The failure to perfect a security interest does not render the security interest unenforceable against the borrower. However, failure to perfect a security interest risks avoidance of the security interest in bankruptcy or subordination to the claims of third parties. 
 At December 31, 2022, approximately 41.7 million or 31.2 of the aggregate dollar amount of our lease portfolio was concentrated in four states: California at 9.4 ; New York at 9.3 ; Florida at 6.3 and Arkansas at 6.2 . Our largest leasing relationship at that date was with the State of Arkansas which consisted of more than 3,000 leases totaling approximately 7.6 million in lease receivables, all of which were performing in accordance with the lease terms. Our second largest leasing relationship was with a drilled pile foundation company located in Florida consisting of four contracts totaling approximately 1.6 million in lease receivables, all of which were performing in accordance with the lease terms. 
 Consumer Lending. We offer a variety of secured and unsecured consumer loans to individuals who reside or work in our market area, including new and used automobile loans, motorcycle loans, boat loans, recreational vehicle loans, mobile home loans and loans secured by certificates of deposit. Most of our consumer loans are made as an accommodation to our existing customers. At December 31, 2022, our consumer loan portfolio totaled 21.0 million, or 2.2 of our total loan and lease portfolio, including 1.2 million of unsecured consumer loans. 
 Consumer loans generally have shorter terms to maturity, which reduces our exposure to changes in interest rates. In addition, management believes that offering consumer loan products helps to expand and create stronger ties to our existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross-marketing opportunities. 
 Originations, Sales and Purchases of Loans 
 Our loan originations are generated by our loan personnel operating at our office locations. While we originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, our ability to generate each type of loan depends upon relative borrower demand and the pricing levels as set in the local marketplace by competing banks, thrifts, credit unions, and mortgage banking companies. Our volume of real estate loan originations is influenced significantly by market interest rates, and, accordingly, the volume of our real estate loan originations can vary from period to period. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we originated 232.1 million of fixed rate loans and leases and 254.2 million of adjustable-rate loans, compared to 315.1 million of fixed rate loans and leases and 218.7 million of adjustable-rate loans during the year ended December 31, 2021.

 As reflected in the tables above, loan and lease originations decreased 47.4 million or 8.9 , to 486.3 million during 2022 compared to 533.7 million during 2021, primarily due to decreases in residential mortgage loans as a result of a slowdown in the refinancing and sales of housing in our area due to rising market interest rates, multifamily and commercial real estate loans also due to increasing interest rates, and commercial and industrial loans as a result of the expiration of the PPP in May 2021. Construction and development loan originations increased year over year in line with management s strategy to expand this portfolio. 
 
 We consider our balance sheet as well as market conditions on an ongoing basis in making decisions as to whether to hold residential loans we originate for investment or to sell these loans to investors, choosing the strategy that is most advantageous to us from a profitability and risk management standpoint. We sell the majority of the fixed-rate conforming and eligible jumbo one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate, generally on a servicing-retained basis, while retaining some non-eligible fixed-rate and adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans in order to manage the duration and time to repricing of our loan portfolio. All FHA, VA and USDA loans we originate are sold on a servicing-released, non-recourse basis in accordance with FHA, VA and USDA guidelines. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we sold 28.1 million and 76.2 million of one- to four-family residential real estate loans, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we did not originate or sell any FHA, VA or USDA loans, compared to 624,000 of FHA, VA and USDA loans originated and sold during the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 We recognize, at the time of sale, the cash gain or loss on the sale of the loans based on the difference between the net cash proceeds received and the carrying value of the loans sold. Subject to market and economic conditions, management intends to continue this sales activity in future periods to generate gain on sale income. 
 
 From time to time, we may purchase loan participations secured by properties within and outside of our primary lending market area in which we are not the lead lender. In these circumstances, we follow our customary loan underwriting and approval policies. At December 31, 2022, we had 50 loans totaling 69.4 million in which we were not the lead lender. All of these participation loans were performing in accordance with their original repayment terms at December 31, 2022. We also have sold portions of loans we originate that exceeded our loans-to-one borrower legal lending limit or for risk diversification. Historically, we have not purchased whole loans. Pursuant to our growth strategy, however, we may purchase whole loans in the future. 
 Delinquencies and Non-Performing Assets 
 Loans and leases are reviewed on a regular basis. Management determines that a loan or lease is impaired or nonperforming when it is probable at least a portion of the loan or lease will not be collected in accordance with the original terms due to a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or the value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. When a loan or lease is determined to be impaired, the measurement of the loan or lease in the allowance for loan and lease losses is based on present value of expected future cash flows, except that all collateral-dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral. Nonaccrual loans and leases are loans and leases for which collectability is questionable and, therefore, interest on such loans will no longer be recognized on an accrual basis. All loans 
 13 

and leases that become 90 days or more delinquent are placed on nonaccrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. 
 When we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure, the real estate is classified as foreclosed assets or Other Real Estate Owned. Foreclosed assets are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Soon after acquisition, we order a new appraisal, or evaluation when acceptable, to determine the current market value of the property. Any excess of the recorded value of the loan over the market value of the property is charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses, or, if the existing allowance is inadequate, charged to expense, in either case during the applicable period of such determination. After acquisition, all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed. 
 We generally cease accruing interest on our loans and leases when contractual payments of principal or interest have become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan or lease is currently performing. A loan or lease may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured. When a loan or lease is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed. Interest received on nonaccrual loans and leases generally is applied against principal or interest and is recognized on a cash basis. Generally, loans and leases are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. 
 Nonperforming loans and leases totaled 9.1 million or 0.94 of total loans and leases at December 31, 2022 and 8.1 million or 0.95 of total loans and leases at December 31, 2021. The increase in nonperforming loans was primarily attributable to a 1.3 million increase in commercial and industrial loans, primarily due to one loan of 1.3 million secured by business assets and a second mortgage, past due more than 90 days and still accruing. At December 31, 2022, our largest nonperforming loan was a 4.9 million nonaccrual commercial construction and development loan that is subject to litigation between the developer and other parties. 
 Loans are accounted for as troubled debt restructurings when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties that lead to a restructuring of the loan, and First Bank Richmond grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. These concessions include a modification of terms, such as a reduction of the stated interest rate or loan balance, a reduction of accrued interest, an extension of the maturity date at an interest rate lower than current market rate for a new loan with similar risk, or some combination thereof to facilitate payment. Troubled debt restructurings are considered impaired loans. No additional loan commitments were outstanding to our troubled debt restructured borrowers at December 31, 2022. 
 Loans on nonaccrual status at the date of modification are initially classified as non-accrual troubled debt restructurings. At December 31, 2022, we had 428,000 in nonaccrual troubled debt restructurings, none of which were in the process of foreclosure at December 31, 2022. Our policy provides that troubled debt restructured loans are returned to accrual status after a period of satisfactory and reasonable future payment performance under the terms of the restructuring. Satisfactory payment performance is generally no less than six consecutive months of timely payments. At December 31, 2022, we had no loans or leases classified as accruing troubled debt restructurings. 
 Foreclosed assets consist of property acquired through formal foreclosure, in-substance foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, and are recorded at the lower of recorded investment or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Write-downs from recorded investment to fair value, which are required at the time of foreclosure, are charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses. After transfer, adjustments to the carrying value of the properties that result from subsequent declines in value are charged to operations in the period in which the declines occur. We had 57,000 in foreclosed assets at December 31, 2022. 
 The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of our non-performing assets at the dates indicated.

 Classified Assets . Our regulators require that we classify loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered to be of lesser quality, as substandard, doubtful or loss. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. 
 When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances for loan and lease losses in an amount deemed prudent by management and approved by the board of directors. General allowances represent loss allowances that have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss, it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100 of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount. Our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances is subject to review by our regulators, which may order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances. 
 15 

In accordance with our loan policy, we regularly review the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Loans are listed on the watch list initially because of emerging financial weaknesses even though the loan is currently performing as agreed, or if the loan possesses weaknesses although currently performing. If a loan deteriorates in asset quality, the classification is changed to special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss depending on the circumstances and the evaluation. Generally, loans 90 days or more past due are placed on nonaccrual status and classified substandard. Management reviews the status of each impaired loan on our watch list on a quarterly basis. 
 On the basis of this review of our assets, our classified assets at the dates indicated were as follows: 
 At December 31, 2022 2021 (In thousands) Special mention 4,034 12,222 Substandard 12,710 8,453 Doubtful 29 42 Loss Total classified assets 16,773 20,717 
 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 
 The allowance for loan and lease losses is maintained at a level which, in management s judgment, is adequate to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. The amount of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of the collectability of the loan and lease portfolio, including the nature of the portfolio, credit concentrations, trends in historical loss experience, specific impaired loans, and economic conditions. Allowances for impaired loans are generally determined based on collateral values or the present value of estimated cash flows. Because of uncertainties associated with regional economic conditions, collateral values, and future cash flows on impaired loans, it is reasonably possible that management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio and the related allowance may change materially in the near-term. The allowance is increased by a provision for loan and lease losses, which is charged to expense and reduced by full and partial charge-offs, net of recoveries. Changes in the allowance relating to impaired loans and leases are charged or credited to the provision for loan and lease losses. Management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on various factors, including, but not limited to, management s ongoing review and grading of loans and leases, facts and issues related to specific loans and leases, historical loan and lease loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans and leases, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. 
 As an integral part of their examination process, the IDFI and the FDIC will periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses, and as a result of such reviews, we may have to adjust our allowance for loan and lease losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in the process for establishing the allowance for loan and lease losses as the process is our responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of management.

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses . The following table sets forth an analysis of our allowance for loan and lease losses at the dates and for the periods indicated. Average balances of residential loans include loans held for sale. 
 At and For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (Dollars in thousands) Allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans outstanding 1.27 1.43 Allowance for loan and lease losses 12,413 12,108 Total loans outstanding 975,000 845,951 Nonaccrual loans to total loans outstanding 0.62 0.73 Nonaccrual loans 6,003 6,184 Total loans outstanding 975,000 845,951 Allowance for loan and lease losses to nonaccrual loans 206.78 195.80 Allowance for loan and lease losses 12,413 12,108 Nonaccrual loans 6,003 6,184 Net charge-offs/(recoveries) during the period to average loans outstanding: Commercial mortgage (0.02) Net recoveries during the period (53) (3) Average amount outstanding 285,404 253,938 Commercial and industrial (0.13) (0.09) Net recoveries during the period (130) (104) Average amount outstanding 98,630 117,528 Construction and development Net charge-offs/(recoveries) during the period Average amount outstanding 112,058 63,634 Multi-family Net charge-offs/(recoveries) during the period Average amount outstanding 106,813 81,429 Residential mortgage (0.01) (0.21) Net recoveries during the period (13) (273) Average amount outstanding 138,147 129,205 Home equity (0.11) Net recoveries during the period (10) Average amount outstanding 9,212 6,488 Leases 0.29 0.21 Net charge-offs during the period 371 257 Average amount outstanding 129,252 119,827 Consumer 0.71 0.21 Net charge-offs during the period 130 31 Average amount outstanding 18,402 14,637 Total loans 0.03 (0.01) Net charge-offs/(recoveries) during the period 295 (92) Average amount outstanding 897,918 786,686 
 The increase in our allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 primarily was driven by a 129.0 million increase in our loan portfolio. The growth in the balance of loans and leases primarily occurred in the construction and development and commercial mortgage categories, which is in line with management's strategy to expand these portfolios. See Management s Discussion and Analysis-Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 Compared

to December 31, 2021 contained in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding changes in our loans, leases, and related allowances. 
 Allocation of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses. The following table sets forth the allowance for loan and lease losses allocated by category, the total balances by category, and the percent of loans and leases in each category to total loans and leases at the dates indicated. The allowance for loan and lease losses allocated to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses in any particular category and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in other categories. At the dates indicated, we had no unallocated allowance for loan and lease losses. 
 At December 31, 2022 2021 Amount Percent of loans and leases in each category to total loans Amount Percent of loans and leases in each category to total loans (Dollars in thousands) Allocated at end of period to: Real estate loans: Residential mortgage 76 15.0 263 15.9 Home equity lines of credit 23 1.1 29 0.8 Multi-family 1,955 12.8 1,875 12.7 Commercial mortgage 4,776 30.5 4,742 30.9 Construction and development 2,855 14.4 2,286 11.1 Total real estate loans 9,685 73.8 9,195 71.4 Consumer loans 241 2.2 195 1.9 Commercial business loans and leases: Commercial and industrial 1,291 10.3 1,639 11.8 Leases 1,196 13.7 1,079 15.0 Total commercial business loans and leases 2,487 24.0 2,718 26.8 Total loans and leases 12,413 100.0 12,108 100.0 
 Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan and lease losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, the existing allowance for loan and lease losses may not be adequate and management may determine that increases in the allowance are necessary if the quality of any portion of our loan or lease portfolio deteriorates as a result. Any material increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 For additional information regarding our allowance for loan and lease losses, see "Note 5: Loans, Leases and Allowance" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
 Investment Activities 
 General . First Bank Richmond has the legal authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-sponsored enterprises and municipal governments, deposits at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions, investment grade corporate bonds and investment grade marketable equity securities. We also are required to maintain an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis stock. 
 The objectives of our investment policy are to provide and maintain liquidity to meet deposit withdrawal and loan funding needs, to help mitigate interest rate and market risk, to diversify our assets, and to maximize the rate of return on 
 18 

invested funds within the context of our interest rate and credit risk objectives. Various factors are considered when making decisions regarding our investment portfolio, including the marketability, maturity and tax consequences of the proposed investment. The maturity structure of investments will be affected by various market conditions, including the current and anticipated slope of the yield curve, the level of interest rates, the trend of new deposit inflows, and the anticipated demand for funds via deposit withdrawals and loan originations and purchases. Our investment securities are usually classified as available-for-sale; however, the purchasing officer has the option, at the time of purchase, to designate individual securities as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading. 
 
 In April 2020, First Bank Richmond created a wholly-owned subsidiary, FB Richmond Holdings, Inc. FB Richmond Holdings to hold a majority of its investment portfolio and take advantage of certain tax benefits. FB Richmond Holdings, a Nevada corporation, holds, services, manages and invests that portion of First Bank Richmond s investment portfolio as may be transferred from time to time by First Bank Richmond to FB Richmond Holdings. FB Richmond Holdings investment policy, for the most part, mirrors that of First Bank Richmond s investment policy. FB Richmond Holdings has hired a third-party investment advisor to manage its securities portfolio, subject to the oversight of its Board of Directors. The President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company serve on the board of directors of FB Richmond Holdings. At December 31, 2022, we had, on a consolidated basis, 284.9 million of securities, at fair value, classified as available-for-sale, 6.7 million of securities, at cost, classified as held-to-maturity, and no securities classified as trading. At that date, FB Richmond Holding managed 290.6 million of our total investment portfolio. 
 We may from time to time invest in special situation investments in order to earn profits or to hedge against interest rate risk. These investments may include interest rate swaps and/or interest rate caps. These investments are handled on a case-by-case basis requiring the advice and counsel of the Asset/Liability Committee. The President and/or Chief Financial Officer can act on his own authority for investments under 400,000. However, once this authority is utilized, it must be reauthorized at the next Asset/Liability Committee meeting. While we have the authority under applicable law to invest in derivative securities, we had no investments in derivative securities at December 31, 2022. 
 We held common stock of the FHLB of Indianapolis in connection with our borrowing activities totaling 9.9 million at December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, First Bank Richmond received a total of 399,000 in dividends from the FHLB. Our required investment in the stock of the FHLB is based on a predetermined formula, carried at cost and evaluated for impairment. We may be required to purchase additional FHLB stock if we increase borrowings in the future. 
 Portfolio Maturities and Yields. The following table sets forth the weighted average yields of investment securities at various ranges of maturities, excluding Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB stock, at December 31, 2022. Weighted average yields on tax-exempt securities are presented on a tax-equivalent basis using a federal tax rate of approximately 21.0 . Certain mortgage-backed securities have adjustable interest rates and will reprice annually within the various maturity ranges. These repricing schedules are not reflected in the table below. Weighted average yield calculations on investment securities available for sale do not give effect to changes in fair value that are reflected as a component of equity. 
 At December 31, 2022 Weighted-Average Yield Due in 1 Year or Less Due After 1 Through 5 Years Due After 5 Through 10 Years Due After 10 Years Securities available for sale: U.S. government, SBA pools and federal agency 3.94 2.33 1.73 1.86 State and municipal obligations 2.90 2.15 2.25 2.43 Government sponsored mortgage-backed securities 1.18 1.78 1.64 Corporate obligations 3.97 4.09 Total securities available for sale 3.11 2.09 2.37 2.06 Securities held to maturity: State and municipal obligations 2.79 3.14 4.88 5.05 Total securities held to maturity 2.79 3.14 4.88 5.05 Total investment securities 3.00 2.26 2.42 2.07

 Sources of Funds 
 General. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also use borrowings, primarily FHLB advances, to supplement cash flow needs, lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk purposes and to manage the cost of funds. In addition, we receive funds from scheduled loan payments, loan and mortgage-backed securities prepayments, maturities and calls of available-for-sale securities, retained earnings and income on earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition. 
 Deposits. We offer deposit accounts to consumers and businesses having a wide range of interest rates and terms. Our deposits consist of savings deposit accounts, money market accounts, NOW and demand accounts and certificates of deposit. We solicit deposits in our market areas as well as online through our website. We also participate in reciprocal deposit services for our customers through the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service CDARS and Insured Cash Sweep ICS networks. We primarily rely on competitive pricing policies, marketing and customer service to attract and retain these deposits. We also accept brokered deposits from deposit brokers. At December 31, 2022, our brokered deposits totaled 257.9 million, or 25.7 of total deposits, with an average interest rate of 1.78 and a 12-month weighted-average maturity, compared to 121.8 million, or 13.5 of total deposits, with an average interest rate of 0.62 and a 27-month weighted-average maturity at December 31, 2021. Our reliance on brokered deposits may increase our overall cost of funds. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, our core deposits, which are deposits other than certificates of deposit of 250,000 or more and brokered deposits, totaled 702.9 million, representing 69.9 of total deposits, compared to 716.4 million, representing 79.6 of total deposits, at December 31, 2021. 
 Our largest banking office based on deposits is our main office in Richmond, Indiana, which had total deposits of 539.7 million or 53.7 of our total deposits at December 31, 2022. Approximately 76.5 769.5 million) of our total deposits were held in our Wayne County, Indiana offices as of December 31, 2022, with 88.3 679.7 million) of those deposits held in our five Richmond, Indiana offices. Overall, 810.4 million or 80.6 of our total deposits were held in Indiana branches and 194.8 million or 19.4 were held in Ohio branches as of December 31, 2022. 
 The Federal Reserve Board generally requires all depository institutions to maintain noninterest-bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts, primarily checking, NOW and Super NOW checking accounts. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic the Federal Reserve reduced the reserve requirement ratio to zero percent effective on March 26, 2020.

 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 219.7 million and 225.3 million, respectively, of our deposit portfolio was uninsured. The uninsured amounts are estimated based on the methodologies and assumptions used for First Bank Richmond's regulatory reporting requirements. The following table sets forth the portion of our time deposits that are in excess of the FDIC insurance limit, by remaining time until maturity, as of December 31, 2022 (dollars in thousands).

 For additional information regarding our deposits, see "Note 9: Deposits" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
 Borrowed Funds. We utilize borrowings as a source of funds, especially when they are less costly than deposits and can be invested at a positive interest rate spread, when we desire additional capacity to fund loan demand or when they meet our asset/liability management goals. Our borrowings historically have consisted of advances from the FHLB of Indianapolis. We may obtain advances from the FHLB of Indianapolis upon the security of the capital stock we own in the FHLB and certain of our mortgage loans and investment securities. Such advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. To the extent such borrowings have different terms to repricing than our deposits, they can change our interest rate risk profile. At December 31, 2022, we had 180.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding. Based on current collateral levels, at December 31, 2022 we could borrow an additional 57.7 million from the FHLB of Indianapolis at prevailing interest rates. 
 22 

We also have an available line of credit with the FHLB of Indianapolis totaling 10.0 million. 
 The following table presents the maturity of term borrowings, which consist entirely of FHLB advances, along with associated weighted average rates as of December 31, 2022.

 Trust and Financial Services 
 We provide a variety of fee-based financial services, including trust and estate administration, investment management services, retirement plan administration and private banking services, in our market areas. Trust services are provided to both individual and corporate customers, including personal trust and agency accounts, and employee benefit plans. We also manage private investment accounts for individuals and institutions. Total wealth management assets under management and administration were 138.8 million at December 31, 2022. These activities provide an additional source of fee income to First Bank Richmond and in 2022 constituted 12.8 of our total non-interest income. 
 Subsidiary and Other Activities 
 
 At December 31, 2022, Richmond Mutual Bancorporation had two subsidiaries, First Bank Richmond and First Insurance Management, Inc. First Bank Richmond is our wholly owned banking subsidiary. First Insurance Management, Inc. was formed in 2022 as a pooled captive insurance company subsidiary of the Company, incorporated in the State of Nevada, for the purpose of providing additional insurance coverage for the Company and its subsidiaries related to the operations of the Company for which insurance may not be economically feasible. As of December 31, 2022, First Insurance Management provided us with various liability and property damage policies for the Company and its related subsidiaries. First Insurance Management is regulated by the State of Nevada Division of Insurance. 
 At December 31, 2022, First Bank Richmond had an active investment subsidiary, FB Richmond Holdings, which is a Nevada corporation that holds substantially all of First Bank Richmond's investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2022, the market value of securities managed was 290.5 million. FB Richmond Holdings has one active subsidiary, FB Richmond Properties, Inc., which is a Delaware corporation holding approximately 101.8 million in loans. 
 Competition 
 We face significant competition within our market both in making loans and leases and attracting deposits. Our market area has a high concentration of financial institutions, including large money center and regional banks, community banks and credit unions. Our competition for loans and deposits comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, equipment financing companies, consumer finance companies and credit unions. We face additional competition for deposits from short-term money market funds, brokerage firms, mutual funds and insurance companies. We also compete with financial technology, or fintech companies. Recent technology advances and other changes have allowed parties to effect financial transactions that previously required the involvement of banks. For example, consumers can maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. 
 
 Based on the most recent data provided by the FDIC, there are approximately 11 and 19 other commercial banks and savings banks operating in our Indiana and Ohio market areas, respectively. Additionally, there are approximately 14 and seven credit unions operating in these same respective market areas. As of June 30, 2022 (the most recent branch deposit data provided by the FDIC), First Bank Richmond s share of bank deposits in Wayne and Shelby Counties, in Indiana, was 
 23 

approximately 22.1 and 1.3 , respectively, and in Shelby and Miami Counties, in Ohio, was approximately 8.7 and 4.2 , respectively. We do not accept deposits at our loan production office located in Columbus, Ohio. 
 How We Are Regulated 
 General. First Bank Richmond is an Indiana-chartered commercial bank. Its deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. First Bank Richmond is subject to extensive regulation by the IDFI, as its chartering agency, and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as its deposit insurer and primary federal regulator. First Bank Richmond is required to file reports with, and is periodically examined by, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the IDFI concerning its activities and financial condition and must obtain regulatory approvals before entering into certain transactions, including, but not limited to, mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions. In addition, First Bank Richmond is a member of and owns stock in the FHLB of Indianapolis, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. 
 As a bank holding company, Richmond Mutual Bancorporation is subject to examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. Richmond Mutual Bancorporation is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws. 
 Set forth below is a description of certain laws and regulations that are applicable to First Bank Richmond and Richmond Mutual Bancorporation. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on First Bank Richmond and Richmond Mutual Bancorporation. Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by Congress or the applicable regulatory agencies, could have a material adverse impact on Richmond Mutual Bancorporation, First Bank Richmond and their operations. 
 Indiana Banking Regulation. First Bank Richmond, as an Indiana commercial bank, is regulated and supervised by the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions, or the IDFI. The IDFI is required to regularly examine each state-chartered bank. The approval of the IDFI is required to establish or close branches, to merge with another bank, to issue stock and to undertake many other activities. Any Indiana bank that does not operate according to the regulations, policies and directives of the IDFI may be sanctioned. 
 The powers that Indiana-chartered banks can exercise under these laws include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 Lending Activities. An Indiana-chartered commercial bank may make a wide variety of mortgage loans including fixed-rate loans, adjustable-rate loans, variable-rate loans, participation loans, graduated payment loans, construction and development loans, condominium and co-operative loans, second mortgage loans and other types of loans that may be made according to applicable regulations. Commercial loans may be made to corporations and other commercial enterprises with or without security. Consumer and personal loans may also be made with or without security. 
 Investment Activities. In general, First Bank Richmond may invest in certain types of debt securities, certain types of corporate equity securities, and certain other assets. However, these investment authorities are constrained by federal law. See - Federal Banking Regulation Investment Activities for such federal restrictions. 
 Loans to One Borrower Limitations. Under Indiana law, First Bank Richmond s total loans or extensions of credit to a single borrower or group of related borrowers cannot exceed, with specified exceptions, 15 of its capital stock, surplus fund and undivided profits. First Bank Richmond may lend additional amounts up to 10 if the loans or extensions of credit are fully secured by readily-marketable collateral. At December 31, 2022, First Bank Richmond complied with these loans-to-one-borrower limitations. At December 31, 2022, First Bank Richmond s largest aggregate amount of loans to one borrower was 17.3 million. 
 Dividends. Under Indiana law, First Bank Richmond is permitted to declare and pay dividends out of its undivided profits. The prior approval of the IDFI is required if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years. See - Federal Banking Regulation Capital Requirements and - Holding Company Regulation for restrictions on dividends under federal law. 
 Assessments. As an Indiana state-chartered commercial bank, First Bank Richmond is required to pay to the IDFI a general assessment fee in connection with the regulation and supervision of First Bank Richmond. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as discussed below, charges all insured depository institutions deposit insurance assessments. 
 24 

Regulatory Enforcement Authority. Any Indiana bank that does not operate according to the regulations, policies and directives of the IDFI may be subject to sanctions for non-compliance, including seizure of the property and business of the bank and suspension or revocation of its charter. The IDFI may, under certain circumstances, suspend or remove officers or directors who have violated the law, conducted the bank s business in a manner which is unsafe, unsound or contrary to the depositors' interests or been negligent in the performance of their duties. In addition, upon finding that a bank has engaged in an unfair or deceptive act or practice, the IDFI may issue an order to cease and desist and impose a fine on the bank. Indiana consumer protection and civil rights statutes applicable to First Bank Richmond permit private individual and class action lawsuits and provide for the rescission of consumer transactions, including loans, and the recovery of statutory and punitive damages and attorney s fees in the case of certain violations of those statutes. 
 Federal Banking Regulation 
 Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions, including state-chartered banks, to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a total capital to risk-based assets and a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. 
 The capital standards require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5 , 6 and 8 , respectively. The regulations also establish a minimum required leverage ratio of at least 4 of Tier 1 capital. In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets more than 2.5 above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, First Bank Richmond s capital exceeded all applicable requirements. See Management s Discussion and Analysis-Capital Resources contained in Part II, Item 7 and Note 17: Regulatory Capital in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
 The Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard for US GAAP that will be effective for us beginning in 2023. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, requires FDIC-insured institutions and their holding companies (banking organizations) to recognize credit losses expected over the life of certain financial assets. CECL covers a broader range of assets than the current method of recognizing credit losses and generally results in earlier recognition of credit losses. Upon adoption of CECL, a banking organization must record a one-time adjustment to its credit loss allowances as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of credit loss allowances under the current methodology and the amount required under CECL. For a banking organization, implementation of CECL is generally likely to reduce retained earnings, and to affect other items, in a manner that reduces its regulatory capital. The federal banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC, have adopted a rule that gives a banking organization the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects of CECL on its regulatory capital. 
 Under the federal prompt corrective action rules, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is required to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions under its jurisdiction, the severity of which depends upon the institution's level of capital. An institution that has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10 or more, a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 8.0 or more, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5 or more and a leverage ratio of 5.0 or more is considered "well capitalized," provided that it is not subject to an agreement, order or directive issued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation requiring it to meet and maintain a specific capital level. Institutions that are not well capitalized are subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits and interest rates on deposits. At December 31, 2022, First Bank Richmond met the criteria to be considered "well capitalized." 
 Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease-and-desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties. 
 25 

Commercial Real Estate Lending Concentrations . The federal banking agencies have issued guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The particular focus is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be sensitive to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The purpose of the guidance is not to limit a bank s commercial real estate lending but to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The guidance directs the FDIC and other bank regulatory agencies to focus their supervisory resources on institutions that may have significant commercial real estate loan concentration risk. A bank that has experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending, has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate loan, or is approaching or exceeding the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis with respect to real estate concentration risk: 
 
 a. Total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100 or more of the bank s total regulatory capital; or 
 
 b. Total commercial real estate loans (as defined in the guidance) represent 300 or more of the bank s total regulatory capital and the outstanding balance of the bank s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50 or more during the prior 36 months. 
 
 The guidance provides that the strength of an institution s lending and risk management practices with respect to such concentrations will be taken into account in supervisory guidance on evaluation of capital adequacy. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank s aggregate recorded loan balances for construction, land development and land loans were 84.9 of total regulatory capital. In addition, at December 31, 2022, the Bank s loans secured by commercial real estate (as defined in the guidance) represented 338.5 of total regulatory capital. 
 Investment Activities. All state-chartered Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured banks, including commercial banks, are generally limited in their investment activities to principal and equity investments of the type and in the amount authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law, subject to certain exceptions. 
 In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is authorized to permit such a state bank to engage in state-authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) if it meets all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. 
 Interstate Banking and Branching. Federal law permits well capitalized and well managed bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state, subject to Federal Reserve Board approval, certain concentration limits and other specified conditions. Interstate mergers of banks are also authorized, subject to regulatory approval and other specified conditions. In addition, banks may establish de novo branches on an interstate basis provided that the branch location is permissible under the law of the host state for banks chartered by that state. 
 Transaction with Affiliates and Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Regulations. Transactions between banks and their affiliates are governed by federal law. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. In a holding company context, the parent bank holding company and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank (although subsidiaries of the bank itself, except financial subsidiaries, are generally not considered affiliates). Generally, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board s Regulation W limit the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10.0 of such institution s capital stock and surplus, and with all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20.0 of such institution s capital stock and surplus. Section 23B applies to covered transactions as well as to certain other transactions and requires that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the institution or subsidiary as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term covered transaction includes the making of loans to, purchase of assets from, and issuance of a guarantee to an affiliate, and other similar transactions. Section 23B transactions also include the provision of services and the sale of assets by a bank to an affiliate. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the financial institution to the affiliate are required to be collateralized according to the requirements set forth in Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. 
 Sections 22(h) and (g) of the Federal Reserve Act place restrictions on loans to a bank s insiders, i.e., executive officers, directors and principal shareholders. Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons and also requires prior board approval for certain loans. In addition, the aggregate amount of 
 26 

extensions of credit by a financial institution to insiders cannot exceed the institution s unimpaired capital and surplus. Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers. 
 Enforcement. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has extensive enforcement authority over insured state-chartered banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System (referred to as non-member banks), including First Bank Richmond. The enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations, breaches of fiduciary duty and unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is required, with certain exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state non-member bank if that bank was critically undercapitalized on average during the calendar quarter beginning 270 days after the date on which the institution became critically undercapitalized. It may also appoint itself as conservator or receiver for an insured state non-member bank under specified circumstances, including, among others: (1) insolvency; (2) substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices; (3) existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; (4) insufficient capital; or (5) the incurrence of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal assistance. 
 Insurance of Deposit Accounts. First Bank Richmond is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Deposit accounts in First Bank Richmond are insured up to a maximum of 250,000 for each separately insured depositor. 
 The FDIC assesses deposit insurance premiums on all FDIC-insured institutions quarterly based on annualized rates. Under these rules, assessment rates for an institution with total assets of less than 10 billion are determined by weighted average CAMELS composite ratings and certain financial ratios, and range from 1.5 to 30.0 basis points, subject to certain adjustments. 
 Extraordinary growth in insured deposits during the first and second quarters of 2020 caused the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio to decline below the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent as of June 30, 2020. In September 2020, the FDIC Board of Directors adopted a Restoration Plan to restore the reserve ratio to at least 1.35 percent within eight years, absent extraordinary circumstances, as required by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The Restoration Plan maintained the assessment rate schedules in place at the time and required the FDIC to update its analysis and projections for the deposit insurance fund balance and reserve ratio at least semiannually. 
 In the semiannual update for the Restoration Plan in June 2022, the FDIC projected that the reserve ratio was at risk of not reaching the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent by September 30, 2028, the statutory deadline to restore the reserve ratio. Based on this update, the FDIC Board approved an Amended Restoration Plan, and concurrently proposed an increase in initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules by 2 basis points, applicable to all insured depository institutions. In October 2022, the FDIC Board finalized the increase with an effective date of January 1, 2023, applicable to the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The revised assessment rate schedules are intended to increase the likelihood that the reserve ratio of the DIF reaches the statutory minimum level of 1.35 percent by September 30, 2028. 
 For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, First Bank Richmond paid 414,000 in FDIC premiums. Assessment rates are applied to an institution's assessment base, which is its average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity during the assessment period. 
 The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments, and in a banking industry emergency the FDIC may also impose a special assessment. Any significant increases in insurance assessment may have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Richmond Mutual Bancorporation and First Bank Richmond. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future. 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition, or violation that may lead to termination of First Bank Richmond s deposit insurance. 
 Community Reinvestment Act . Under the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, as implemented by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a state non-member bank, such as First Bank Richmond, has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions, nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are 
 27 

best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in connection with its examination of a state non-member bank, to assess the institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to acquire branches and other financial institutions. The CRA requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to provide a written evaluation of an institution s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. First Bank Richmond s latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation CRA rating was Satisfactory. 
 Consumer Protection and Fair Lending Regulations. Indiana chartered banks are subject to a variety of federal and Indiana statutes and regulations that are intended to protect consumers and prohibit discrimination in the granting of credit. These statutes and regulations provide for a range of sanctions for non-compliance with their terms, including imposition of administrative fines and remedial orders, and referral to the Attorney General for prosecution of a civil action for actual and punitive damages and injunctive relief. Certain of these statutes, including Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair and deceptive acts and practices against consumers, authorize private individual and class action lawsuits and the award of actual, statutory and punitive damages and attorneys fees for certain types of violations. The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices against consumers, which can be enforced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and state Attorneys General. 
 USA Patriot Act. First Bank Richmond is subject to the USA PATRIOT Act, which gives federal agencies additional powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. The USA PATRIOT Act includes measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies, and imposes affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents, and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act. 
 Other Regulations. Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by First Bank Richmond are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. First Bank Richmond s operations are also subject to state and federal laws applicable to credit and other transactions, such as the: 
 Truth in Lending Act, which requires lenders to disclose the terms and conditions of consumer credit; 
 Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, which requires lenders to disclose the nature and costs of the real estate settlement process and prohibits specific practices, such as kickbacks, and places limitations upon the use of escrow accounts; 
 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; 
 Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; 
 Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; and 
 Rules and regulations of the various federal and state agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal and state laws. 
 The deposit operations of First Bank Richmond also are subject to, among others, the: 
 Truth in Savings Act, which requires financial institutions to disclose the terms and conditions of their deposit accounts; 
 Expedited Funds Availability Act, which requires banks to make funds deposited in transaction accounts available to their customers within specified time frames; 
 Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; 
 Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as Check 21 ), which gives substitute checks, such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; 
 28 

Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; and 
 Indiana banking laws and regulations governing deposit powers and other matters. 
 
 Federal Home Loan Bank System. First Bank Richmond is a member of the FHLB of Indianapolis, one of the 11 regional FHLBs which provide a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Member institutions are required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB. This stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. First Bank Richmond reviews the cost basis of the FHLB stock for ultimate recoverability regularly. At December 31, 2022, no impairment of the value of the stock has been recognized. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank had 180.0 million of FHLB advances and 10.0 million available on its line of credit with the FHLB. 
 
 Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts, primarily checking accounts. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve reduced the reserve requirement ratio to zero percent effective on March 26, 2020, to support lending to households and businesses. At December 31, 2022, the Bank was in compliance with the reserve requirements. 
 The Bank is authorized to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank "discount window." An eligible institution need not exhaust other sources of funds before going to the discount window, nor are there restrictions on the purposes for which the institution can use primary credit. At December 31, 2022, the Bank had no outstanding borrowings from the discount window. 
 Acquisitions. An acquisition of Richmond Mutual Bancorporation or First Bank Richmond, an acquisition of control of either, or an acquisition by either of another bank holding company or depository institution or control of such a company or institution would generally be subject to prior approval by applicable federal and state banking regulators, as would certain acquisitions by Richmond Mutual Bancorporation or First Bank Richmond of other types of entities. "Control" is defined in various ways for this purpose, including but not limited to control of 10 of outstanding voting stock of an entity. See Holding Company Regulation below. 
 Holding Company Regulation. Richmond Mutual Bancorporation is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. As such, Richmond Mutual Bancorporation is registered with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements applicable to bank holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over Richmond Mutual Bancorporation and its non-bank subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary bank. 
 A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in non-banking activities, or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5 of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. 
 The Federal Reserve Board is required to establish for all bank and savings and loan holding companies, minimum consolidated capital requirements that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary banks apply to bank holding companies with less than 3.0 billion of consolidated assets. 
 A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10 or more of the company s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. There is an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions. 
 The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding capital distributions, including dividends, by bank holding companies. In general, the policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks (referred to as the source of strength doctrine) by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. 
 29 

However, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of Richmond Mutual Bancorporation to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
 Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, depository institutions are liable to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for losses suffered or anticipated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to such an institution in danger of default. 
 Federal Securities Laws. Richmond Mutual Bancorporation s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Richmond Mutual Bancorporation is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 Emerging Growth Company Status. The JOBS Act, which was enacted in April 2012, has made numerous changes to the federal securities laws to facilitate access to capital markets. Under the JOBS Act, a company with total annual gross revenues of less than 1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year qualifies as an emerging growth company. Richmond Mutual Bancorporation qualifies as and has elected to be an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. 
 An emerging growth company may choose not to hold non-binding advisory stockholder votes on annual executive compensation (more frequently referred to as say-on-pay votes) or on executive compensation payable in connection with a merger (more frequently referred to as say-on-golden parachute votes). An emerging growth company also is not subject to the requirement that its auditors attest to the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting and can provide scaled disclosure regarding executive compensation. Richmond Mutual Bancorporation is also not subject to the auditor attestation requirement or additional executive compensation disclosure so long as it remains a smaller reporting company under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. Finally, an emerging growth company may elect to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company. Such an election is irrevocable during the period a company is an emerging growth company. Richmond Mutual Bancorporation has elected to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company. 
 A company loses emerging growth company status on the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year of the company during which it had total annual gross revenues of 1.0 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the company pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933; (iii) the date on which such company has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which such company is deemed to be a large accelerated filer under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. 
 Taxation 
 The following discussion of federal and state taxation is intended only to summarize material income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Richmond Mutual Bancorporation and First Bank Richmond. 
 Federal Taxation. Richmond Mutual Bancorporation and First Bank Richmond are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. Our federal and state tax returns have not been audited for the past five years. 
 Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, we currently report our income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and use a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal income tax returns. Richmond Mutual Bancorporation and First Bank Richmond will file a consolidated federal income tax return. 
 Capital Loss Carryovers. A corporation cannot recognize capital losses in excess of capital gains generated. Generally, a financial institution may carry back capital losses to the preceding three taxable years and forward to the succeeding five taxable years. Any capital loss carryback or carryover is treated as a short-term capital loss for the year to which it is carried. As such, it is grouped with any other capital losses for the year to which it is carried and is used to offset any capital gains. Any loss remaining after the five-year carryover period is not deductible. At December 31, 2022, we had no capital loss carryovers. 
 Corporate Dividends. Richmond Mutual Bancorporation may generally exclude from its income 100 of dividends received from First Bank Richmond as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. 
 30 

State Taxation. First Bank Richmond is subject to Indiana s financial institutions tax, which is imposed at a flat rate as of December 31, 2022, of 5.0 on adjusted gross income apportioned to Indiana. Adjusted gross income, for purposes of the financial institutions tax, begins with taxable income as defined by Section 63 of the Internal Revenue Code and incorporates federal tax law to the extent that it affects the computation of taxable income. Federal taxable income is then adjusted by several Indiana modifications including only considering members of the combined group which have Indiana nexus. The Indiana legislature started reducing the financial institutions tax from 8.5 to 6.0 in 0.5 increments over a seven-year period that commenced in 2014. The full rate reduction to 4.9 will be phased in fully by 2023. First Bank Richmond is not currently under audit with respect to its Indiana tax returns. 
 First Bank Richmond is also subject to Ohio taxation in the same general manner as other financial institutions. In particular, Richmond Mutual Bancorporation and First Bank Richmond will be subject to the Ohio corporation franchise tax, which is an excise tax imposed on corporations for the privilege of doing business in Ohio, owning capital or property in Ohio, holding a charter or certificate of compliance authorizing the corporation to do business in Ohio, or otherwise having nexus with Ohio during a calendar year. For Ohio franchise tax purposes, financial institutions are currently taxed at a rate equal to 0.8 of apportioned net capital. 
 Other applicable state taxes include generally applicable sales and use taxes plus real and personal property taxes. 
 As a Maryland business corporation, Richmond Mutual Bancorporation is required to file an annual report with and pay franchise taxes to the State of Maryland. 
 Employees and Human Capital 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 181 full-time equivalent employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. Management believes that we have a good working relationship with our employees. 
 
 To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make First Bank Richmond an inclusive, safe and healthy workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits, health and welfare programs. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 73 of our workforce was female and 27 male, and our average tenure was 10.6 years. As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive total rewards programs for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent. In addition to healthy base wages, additional programs include annual bonus opportunities, a Company augmented Employee Stock Ownership Plan, Company matched 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, and employee assistance programs. 
 
 The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of flexible and convenient health and welfare programs, including benefits that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant operating environment changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes giving some employees the ability to work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. 
 
 A core tenet of our talent system is to both develop talent from within and supplement with external hires. This approach has yielded loyalty and commitment in our employee base which in turn grows our business, our products, and our customers, while adding new employees and external ideas supports a continuous improvement mindset. We believe that our 10.6 year average tenure reflects the engagement of our employees in this core talent system tenet.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 An investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit and is subject to risks inherent in our business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included and incorporated by reference in this report. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described 
 32 

below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, capital levels, cash flows, liquidity, results of operations and prospects. The market price of our common stock could decline significantly due to any of these identified or other risks, and you could lose some or all of your investment. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. 

Risks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions 
 
 A worsening of economic conditions in our market area could reduce demand for our products and services and/or result in increases in our level of non-performing loans, which could adversely affect our operations, financial condition and earnings. 
 
 Local economic conditions have a significant impact on the ability of our borrowers to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing loans. A return of recessionary conditions or adverse economic conditions in our market areas may reduce our rate of growth, affect our customers' ability to repay loans and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. A deterioration in economic conditions in the market areas we serve as a result of inflation, a recession, the effects of COVID-19 variants or other factors could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations: 
 
 demand for our products and services may decline; 
 loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase; 
 collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, thereby reducing customers future borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans; and 
 the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us. 
 
 Moreover, a significant decline in general local, regional or national economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, severe weather, natural disasters, widespread disease or pandemics, acts of terrorism, an outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, unemployment or other factors beyond our control could further impact these local economic conditions and could further negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance. 
 
 Future changes in interest rates could reduce our profits and affect the value of our assets and liabilities . 
 
 Net income is the amount by which net interest income and non-interest income exceed non-interest expense, the provision for loan and lease losses and taxes. Net interest income makes up a majority of our net income and is based on the difference between the interest income we earn on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. 
 
 The yields we earn on our assets and the rates we pay on our liabilities are generally fixed for a contractual period of time. Like many financial institutions, our liabilities generally have shorter contractual maturities than our assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility because market interest rates change over time. In addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. In a period of rising interest rates, the interest income we earn on our assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest we pay on our liabilities. A decline in interest rates results in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities as borrowers refinance their debt to reduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities. Furthermore, an inverted interest rate yield curve, where short-term interest rates (which are usually the rates at which financial institutions borrow funds) are higher than long-term interest rates (which are usually the rates at which financial institutions lend funds for fixed-rate loans) can reduce a financial institution s net interest margin and create financial risk for financial institutions that originate longer-term, fixed-rate mortgage loans. At December 31, 2022, 41.5 of our loan and lease portfolio consisted of fixed-rate loans and leases. 
 
 33 

As is the case with many banks our emphasis on increasing core deposits has resulted in an increasing percentage of our deposits being comprised of deposits bearing no or a relatively low rate of interest and having a shorter duration than our assets. At December 31, 2022, we had 314.3 million in certificates of deposit that mature within one year and 544.5 million in noninterest bearing, NOW checking, savings and money market accounts. We would incur a higher cost of funds to retain these deposits in a rising interest rate environment. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. 
 
 Any substantial prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect the value of our assets and liabilities and ultimately affect our earnings. 
 
 Inflationary pressures and rising prices may affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Inflation has risen sharply since the end of 2021 and throughout 2022 at levels not seen for over 40 years. Inflationary pressures are currently expected to remain elevated throughout 2023. Small to medium-sized businesses may be impacted more during periods of high inflation as they are not able to leverage economics of scale to mitigate cost pressures compared to larger businesses. Consequently, the ability of our business customers to repay their loans may deteriorate, and in some cases this deterioration may occur quickly, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, a prolonged period of inflation could cause wages and other costs to the Company to increase, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic could continue to pose risks and could harm our business, our results of operations and the prospects of the Company. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the global and national economy and certain industries and geographies in which our clients operate. Given its ongoing and dynamic nature, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business of the Company, its clients, employees and third-party service providers. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain. Additionally, the responses of various governmental and nongovernmental authorities and consumers to the pandemic may have material long-term effects on the Company and its clients which are difficult to quantify. 
 
 We could be subject to a number of risks as the result of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and COVID 19 variants, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, ability to execute our growth strategy and ability to pay dividends. These risks include, but are not limited to, changes in demand for our products and services; increased loan losses or other impairments in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for loan losses; a decline in collateral for our loans, especially real estate; unanticipated unavailability of employees; increased cyber security risks as employees work remotely; a prolonged weakness in economic conditions resulting in a reduction of future projected earnings could necessitate a valuation allowance against our current outstanding deferred tax assets and increased costs as the Company and our regulators, customers and vendors adapt to evolving pandemic conditions. 

Risks Related to Our Business 
 
 We have a substantial amount of commercial and multi-family real estate and commercial and industrial loans, and intend to continue to increase originations of these types of loans. These loans involve credit risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, our commercial real estate, multi-family real estate and commercial and industrial loans totaled 523.4 million, or 53.7 of our total loans and leases. While these types of loans are potentially more profitable than residential mortgage loans, they are generally more sensitive to regional and local economic conditions, making loss levels more difficult to predict. These loans also generally have relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Given their larger balances and the complexity of the underlying collateral, commercial and multi-family real estate and commercial and industrial loans generally have more risk than the one- to four-family residential real estate loans we originate. Because the repayment of these types of loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower s properties or related businesses, repayment can be affected by factors outside the borrower's control, such as adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy, disruptions in supply chains, or change in government regulations. 
 34 

In recent years, commercial real estate markets have been experiencing substantial growth, and increased competitive pressures have contributed significantly to historically low capitalization rates and rising property values. Furthermore, commercial real estate markets have been particularly impacted by the economic disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has also been a catalyst for the evolution of various remote work options which could impact the long-term performance of some types of office properties within our commercial real estate portfolio. Accordingly, the federal banking regulatory agencies have expressed concerns about weaknesses in the current commercial real estate market. Further, unlike residential mortgage loans, commercial and industrial loans may be secured by collateral other than real estate, such as inventory and accounts receivable, the value of which may depreciate over time, may be more difficult to appraise or liquidate and may be more susceptible to fluctuation in value at default. Failures in our risk management policies, procedures and controls could adversely affect our ability to manage this portfolio going forward and could result in an increased rate of delinquencies in, and increased losses from, this portfolio, which, accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We have focused on growing our construction and development loan portfolio in recent years which adds additional risks to our loan portfolio. 
 
 Construction and development loans totaled 139.9 million, or 14.4 of total loans, as of December 31, 2022, of which 127.0 million were commercial construction loans and 12.9 million were residential real estate construction loans, compared to total construction and development loans of 58.4 million, or 7.8 of total loans, at December 31, 2020. Construction lending generally involves greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. In the event a loan is made on property that is not yet approved for the planned development or improvements, there is a risk that necessary approvals will not be granted or will be delayed. Risk of loss on a construction loan also depends upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction cost is inaccurate, we may be required to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Moreover, if the estimated value of the completed project is inaccurate, the borrower may hold a property with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the construction loan upon the sale of the property. Construction loans also carry the risk that construction will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs. In addition, repayment of these loans can be dependent on the sale or rental of the property to third parties, and the ultimate sale or rental of the property may not occur as anticipated. Properties under construction are often difficult to sell and typically must be completed in order to be successfully sold, which complicates the process of working with our problem construction loans. Further, in the case of speculative construction loans, there is the added risk associated with the borrower obtaining a take-out commitment for a permanent loan. Loans on land under development or held for future construction also pose additional risk because of the lack of income production by the property and the potential illiquid nature of the collateral. Other risks may include the fraudulent diversion of construction funds, the filing of mechanics liens by contractors, subcontractors or suppliers, or the contractor s failure to complete the construction of the project. 
 
 Our portfolio of loans with a higher risk of loss is increasing and the unseasoned nature of our commercial loan portfolio may result in errors in judging its collectability, which may lead to additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs, which would hurt our profits. 
 
 Our commercial loan portfolio, which includes commercial and multi-family real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans and construction loans, has increased to 663.3 million, or 68.0 of total loans and leases, at December 31, 2022 from 226.9 million, or 48.5 of total loans and leases, at December 31, 2016. A large portion of our commercial loan portfolio is unseasoned, meaning they were originated recently. Our limited experience with these borrowers does not provide us with a significant payment history pattern with which to judge future collectability. Further, these loans have not been subjected to unfavorable economic conditions. As a result, it is difficult to predict the future performance of this part of our loan portfolio. These loans may have delinquency or charge-off levels above our historical experience, which could adversely affect our future performance. 
 
 If we are unable to maintain and grow revenue from our leasing business our future revenue and earnings may be adversely impacted. 
 
 Our lease financing operation consists of direct financing leases which are used by commercial customers to finance purchases such as medical, computer and manufacturing equipment, audio/visual equipment, industrial assets, construction and transportation equipment, and a wide variety of other commercial equipment. Revenue generated from our leasing business accounted for 15.4 and 16.3 of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 35 

We rely solely on brokers and other third-party originators to generate our lease transactions. To generate deal flow, we work with over 100 brokers and third-party originators across the country, some of which are one-person shops and others more established companies, with most of the volume coming from fewer than 25 referral sources. None of our relationships are exclusive and any may be terminated at any time. During 2022, of our total 70.3 million in lease originations, the top five brokers/third party originators accounted for approximately 50.3 of our total volume of lease originations, one of whom accounted for approximately 15.6 of our total volume of lease originations. At December 31, 2022, our top 25 brokers/third party originators collectively accounted for 80 of our total direct financing lease portfolio, with our largest broker/third party originator accounting for 12.4 of the portfolio. If our highest producing brokers/third party originators cease to do business with us, or if their customers cease to do business with them, and we or they are unable to find alternative customers with comparable financing needs, we may experience decreased leasing volume and our revenues may decline as a result, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our leasing business exposes us to different credit risks than our real estate secured lending. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, direct financing leases totaled 133.5 million, or 13.7 of our total loan and lease portfolio. Our direct financing leases, while short term in nature, are inherently risky as they are secured by assets that depreciate rapidly. In some cases, repossessed collateral may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding lease balance and the remaining deficiency may not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. Also, if a lessee under a defaulted lease files for protection under the bankruptcy laws, then: (i) we may experience difficulties and delays in recovering the equipment from the defaulting party; (ii) the equipment may be returned in poor condition; and (iii) we may be unable to enforce important contract provisions against the insolvent party. We do not expect to be able to recover software that we lease or finance for a customer that is not on a computer s hard drive and, even if we could do so, we generally would not be able to lease or sell the same software again under the terms of use required by the software vendors. 
 
 Finance leasing collections depend on the customer's continuing financial stability, and therefore are more likely to be adversely affected by the cash flows of the business within certain industries. Factors that may adversely affect the ability of our customers to meet their repayment plans include, among other things, their inability to implement their business plans or to meet their sales targets, any downturn in the markets or industries in which they operate, or any declines in general economic conditions. There is no guarantee that the financial condition of our customers will remain healthy in the future, that our customers will continue to fulfill their repayment obligations on time, or that any of our customers will not ultimately default on their leases. As a result, we cannot assure you that our profitability or the demand for our leasing services from our customers will be maintained at historical levels. 
 
 Moreover, approximately 41.7 million or 31.2 of our total lease portfolio is to customers located in California, New York, Florida, and Arkansas. A return of recessionary conditions or adverse economic conditions within these market areas may reduce our leasing volume and affect our customers' ability to make lease payments, resulting in higher defaults, which may result in our inability to fully recover our investment in the related equipment and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 If our allowance for loan and lease losses is not sufficient to cover actual losses, our earnings could decrease. 
 
 We periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses for adequacy considering economic conditions and trends, collateral values and credit quality indicators, including past charge-off experience and levels of past due loans and nonperforming assets. We cannot be certain that our allowance for loan and lease losses will be adequate over time to cover credit losses in our portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries or markets, and changes in borrower behaviors. Differences between our actual experience and assumptions and the effectiveness of our models may adversely affect our business, financial condition, including liquidity and capital, and results of operations. 
 
 In addition, the FASB has adopted an accounting standard referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, which will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for credit losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for credit losses only when they have been incurred and are probable, which is expected to require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and greatly increase the types of data we need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses. This accounting pronouncement is applicable to us effective January 1, 2023. As of the adoption and day one measurement date of January 1, 2023, the Company expects to record a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings, net of income taxes, on the consolidated balance sheet. The allowance will increase between 
 36 

2.3 million and 3.0 million from December 31, 2022. CECL also requires the establishment of a reserve for potential losses from unfunded commitments that is recorded in other liabilities, separate from the allowance for credit losses, which will be approximately 1.8 million to 2.5 million. Also, as required by CECL, the Company reviewed the held-to-maturity debt securities portfolio and determined the expected losses were immaterial. The magnitude of the change in the Company s allowance for credit losses at the adoption date will depend upon the nature and characteristics of the portfolio at the adoption date, as well as macroeconomic conditions and forecasts at that time, other management judgements, and continued refinement and validation of the model and methodologies. See also, Note 2 Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10 K. 
 
 The federal banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, have adopted a rule that gives a banking organization the option to phase in over a three- year period the day-one adverse effects of CECL on its regulatory capital. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination. Any increases in the provision for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and capital. 
 
 Changes in the valuation of our securities portfolio could hurt our profits and reduce our capital levels. 
 
 Our securities portfolio may be impacted by fluctuations in market value, potentially reducing accumulated other comprehensive income and/or earnings. Fluctuations in market value may be caused by changes in market interest rates, lower market prices for securities and limited investor demand. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis, with more frequent evaluation for selected issues. In analyzing a debt issuer s financial condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, industry analysts reports and, to a lesser extent given the relatively insignificant levels of depreciation in our debt portfolio, spread differentials between the effective rates on instruments in the portfolio compared to risk-free rates. In analyzing an equity issuer s financial condition, management considers industry analysts reports, financial performance and projected target prices of investment analysts within a one-year time frame. If this evaluation shows impairment to the actual or projected cash flows associated with one or more securities, a potential loss to earnings may occur. Changes in interest rates can also have an adverse effect on our financial condition, as our available-for-sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value, and therefore are impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. We increase or decrease our stockholders equity by the amount of change in the estimated fair value of the available-for-sale securities, net of taxes. Declines in market value could result in other-than-temporary impairments of these assets, which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels. As of December 31, 2022, we had no securities that were deemed impaired. 
 
 A tightening of credit markets and liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition. 
 
 Liquidity is essential to our business. A tightening of the credit markets and the inability to obtain adequate funding to replace deposits and fund continued loan growth may affect asset growth, our earnings capability and capital levels negatively. We rely on a number of different sources in order to meet our potential liquidity demands. Our primary sources of liquidity are increases in deposit accounts, including brokered deposits, as well as cash flows from loan payments and our securities portfolio. Borrowings, especially from the Federal Home Loan Bank and repurchase agreements, also provide us with a source of funds to meet liquidity demands. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically, or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include adverse regulatory action against us or a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated. Our ability to borrow also could be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets, negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry or deterioration in credit markets. 
 
 We use estimates in determining the fair value of certain assets, such as mortgage servicing rights MSRs ). If our estimates prove to be incorrect, we may be required to write down the value of these assets which could adversely affect our earnings. 
 
 We sell a portion of our one- to four-family loans in the secondary market. We generally retain the right to service these loans through First Bank Richmond. At December 31, 2022, the book value of our MSRs was 2.0 million. We use a 
 37 

financial model that uses, wherever possible, quoted market prices to value our MSRs. This model is complex and also uses assumptions related to interest and discount rates, prepayment speeds, delinquency and foreclosure rates and ancillary fee income. Valuations are highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictability of the relationships that drive the results of the model. The primary risk associated with MSRs is that they will lose a substantial portion of their value as a result of higher than anticipated prepayments occasioned by declining interest rates. Conversely, these assets generally increase in value in a rising interest rate environment to the extent that prepayments are slower than anticipated. If prepayment speeds increase more than estimated, or delinquency and default levels are higher than anticipated, we may be required to write down the value of our MSRs which could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels. We obtain independent valuations quarterly to determine if impairment in the asset exists. 
 
 If our investment in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis becomes impaired, our earnings and stockholders equity could decrease. 
 
 At December 31, 2022, we owned 9.9 million in Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB of Indianapolis stock. We are required to own this stock to be a member of and to obtain advances from the FHLB of Indianapolis. This stock is not marketable and can only be redeemed by the FHLB of Indianapolis. The most recent stock buyback initiated by the FHLB of Indianapolis was in 2015. The FHLB of Indianapolis financial condition is linked, in part, to the eleven other members of the FHLB System and to accounting rules and asset quality risks that could materially lower their capital, which would cause our FHLB of Indianapolis stock to be deemed impaired, resulting in a decrease in our earnings and assets. 
 
 Our size makes it more difficult for us to compete. 
 
 Our asset size makes it more difficult to compete with other financial institutions that are larger and can more easily afford to invest in the marketing and technologies needed to attract and retain customers. Because our principal source of income is the net interest income we earn on our loans and investments after deducting interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds, our ability to generate the revenues needed to cover our expenses and finance such investments is limited by the size of our loan and investment portfolios. Accordingly, we are not always able to offer new products and services as quickly as our competitors. Our lower earnings may also make it more difficult to offer competitive salaries and benefits. In addition, our smaller customer base may make it difficult to generate meaningful non-interest income from such activities as securities brokerage or the sale of insurance products. Finally, as a smaller institution, we are disproportionately affected by the continually increasing costs of compliance with new banking and other regulations. 
 
 As a community bank, maintaining our reputation in our market area is critical to the success of our business, and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance. 
 
 We are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. A key component of our business strategy is to rely on our reputation for customer service and knowledge of local markets to expand our presence by capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in our current market and contiguous areas. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. We operate in many different financial service businesses and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a significant number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss from operations, including fraud by employees or outside persons, employees execution of incorrect or unauthorized transactions, data processing and technology errors or hacking and breaches of internal control systems. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected. 
 
 We face significant operational risks because the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions and because of our reliance on technology. 
 
 Our business requires us to collect, process, transmit and store significant amounts of confidential information regarding our customers, employees and our own business, operations, plans and business strategies. Our operational and security systems infrastructure, including our computer systems, data management and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our performance. Our operational risks include the risk of malfeasance by employees or persons outside our company, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, systems failures or interruptions, breaches of our internal control systems and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes 
 38 

the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of operational deficiencies or as a result of non-compliance with applicable regulatory standards or customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. 
 
 In the event of a breakdown in our internal control systems, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, or a breach of our security systems, including if confidential or proprietary information were to be mishandled, misused or lost, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action, civil litigation and/or suffer damage to our reputation. Although we have not experienced any material technology failures, cyber-attacks or other information or security breaches, or material losses related to any such events to date, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such events, losses or other consequences in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats and our role as a provider of financial services, our continuous transmission of sensitive information to, and storage of such information by, third parties, including our vendors and regulators, the outsourcing of some of our business operations, threats of cyber-terrorism, and system and customer account updates and conversions. As a result, cyber-security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority. 
 
 Our information systems may experience failure, interruption or breach in security. 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to store sensitive data. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in significant disruption to our operations. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, including customer and company information, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, theft, misuse, loss, release or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events. These types of threats may derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties, or may result from accidental technological failure. Our technologies, systems, networks and software have been and continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and attacks. Any failures related to upgrades and maintenance of our technology and information systems could further increase our information and system security risk. Our increased use of cloud and other technologies, such as remote work technologies, also increase our risk of being subject to a cyber-attack. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. 
 
 Our customers, employees and third parties that we do business with have been, and will continue to be, targeted by parties using fraudulent e-mails and other communications in attempts to misappropriate passwords, bank account information or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware programs to our information systems, the information systems of our merchants or third-party service providers and/or our customers' personal devices, which are beyond our security control systems. Though we endeavor to mitigate these threats through product improvements, use of encryption and authentication technology and customer and employee education, such cyber-attacks against us, our merchants, our third-party service providers and our customers remain a serious issue and have been successful in the past. 
 
 Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information systems and have implemented various measures to manage the risks of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Even well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable to attempted security breaches or disruptions because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. Furthermore, in the event of a cyber-attack, we may be delayed in identifying or responding to the attack, which could increase the negative impact of the cyber-attack on our own business, financial condition and results of operations. While we maintain specific "cyber" insurance coverage, which would apply in the event of various breach scenarios, the amount of coverage may not be adequate in any particular case. Furthermore, because cyber threat scenarios are inherently difficult to predict and can take many forms, some breaches may not be covered under our cyber insurance coverage. A security breach or other significant disruption of our information systems or those related to our customers, merchants or our third-party vendors, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could (i) disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of our customers; (ii) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers; (iii) result in a violation of applicable privacy, data breach and other laws, subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny and exposing us to civil litigation, enforcement actions, governmental fines and possible financial liability; (iv) require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; or (v) harm our reputation or cause a 
 39 

decrease in the number of customers that choose to do business with us. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our operations rely on certain external vendors. 
 
 We rely on certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations. These third-party vendors are sources of operational and informational security risks to us, including risks associated with operational errors, information system failures, interruptions or breaches and unauthorized disclosures of sensitive or confidential client or customer information. If these vendors encounter any of these issues, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, we could be exposed to disruption of operations, loss of service or connectivity to customers, reputational damage, and litigation risk that could have a material adverse effect on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 In addition, our operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements. Although we have selected these external vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. The failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements, because of changes in the vendor's organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services or strategic focus or for any other reason, could be disruptive to our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, and in turn, our financial condition and results of operations. Replacing these external vendors could also entail significant delay and expense. 
 
 We will be required to transition from the use of the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") in the future. 
 
 We have certain loans indexed to LIBOR to calculate the interest rate. ICE Benchmark Administration, the authorized and regulated administrator of LIBOR, ended publication of the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR tenors on December 31, 2021 and the remaining USD LIBOR tenors will end publication in June 2023. Financial services regulators and industry groups have collaborated to develop alternate reference rate indices or reference rates. The transition to a new reference rate requires changes to contracts, risk and pricing models, valuation tools, systems, product design and hedging strategies. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR (with the exception of overnight repurchase agreements, which are expected to be based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"). Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, alternative reference rates, the elimination or replacement of LIBOR, or other reforms may adversely affect the value of, and the return on our loans and our investment securities, and may impact the availability and cost of borrowings. 
 
 The language in our LIBOR-based contracts and financial instruments has developed over time and may have various events that trigger when a successor rate to the designated rate would be selected. If a trigger is satisfied, contracts and financial instruments may give the calculation agent discretion over the substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates to be selected. The implementation of a substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our borrowers may result in our incurring significant expenses in implementing the transition, may result in reduced loan balances if borrowers do not accept the substitute index or indices, and may result in disputes or litigation with customers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute index or indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 
 We are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities or properties we own. 
 
 A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and we could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to one or more of these properties, or with respect to properties that we own in operating our business. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing defaulted loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous conditions or toxic substances are found on these properties, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage, civil fines and criminal penalties regardless of when the hazardous conditions or toxic substances first affected any particular property. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses to address unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Our policies, which require us to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on non-residential real property, may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 40 

Regulatory and Accounting Related Risks 
 
 We operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and state laws and regulations that could increase our costs of operations. 
 
 The banking industry is extensively regulated. Federal banking regulations are designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers, not to benefit a company's shareholders. These regulations may sometimes impose significant limitations on our operations. These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, and monetary laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. These laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time. Any new regulations or legislation, change in existing regulation or oversight, whether a change in regulatory policy or a change in a regulator's interpretation of a law or regulation, could have a material impact on our operations, increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business and adversely affect our profitability. Further, our failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in civil or criminal sanctions and money penalties by state and federal agencies, and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See "Part I, Item 1. Business - How We Are Regulated." for more information about the regulations to which we are subject. 
 
 Changes in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and/or increase our costs of operations. 
 
 First Bank Richmond is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the FDIC and the IDFI, and Richmond Mutual Bancorporation is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the federal deposit insurance fund and the depositors of First Bank Richmond, rather than for our stockholders. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan and lease losses. These regulations, along with existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance and monetary laws, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations, control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. Further, changes in accounting standards can be both difficult to predict and involve judgment and discretion in their interpretation by us and our independent accounting firm. These changes could materially impact, potentially even retroactively, how we report our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The Company s reported financial results depend on management s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates, which, if incorrect, could cause unexpected losses in the future. 
 
 The Company s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. The Company s management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management s judgment regarding the most appropriate manner to report the Company s financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances, yet might result in the Company s reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative. 
 
 Certain accounting policies are critical to presenting the Company s financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. These critical accounting policies include the allowance for loan losses, estimations of fair value and income taxes. Because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters, the Company may be required to do one or more of the following: significantly increase the allowance for loan losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the reserve provided, recognize significant losses on the remeasurement of certain asset and liability balances, or significantly increase its accrued taxes liability. For more information, refer to Critical Accounting Estimates included in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K. 
 
 41 

Climate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may materially affect the Company s business and results of operations. 
 
 The effects of climate change continue to create an alarming level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, the global business community has increased its political and social awareness surrounding the issue, and the United States has entered into international agreements in an attempt to reduce global temperatures, such as reentering the Paris Agreement. Further, the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies continue to propose numerous initiatives to supplement the global effort to combat climate change. Similar and even more expansive initiatives are expected under the current administration, including potentially increasing supervisory expectations with respect to banks risk management practices, accounting for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systemic risk assessments, revising expectations for credit portfolio concentrations based on climate-related factors and encouraging investment by banks in climate-related initiatives and lending to communities disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change. The lack of empirical data surrounding the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change render it difficult, or even impossible, to predict how specifically climate change may impact our financial condition and results of operations; however, the physical effects of climate change may also directly impact us. Specifically, unpredictable and more frequent weather disasters may adversely impact the real property, and/or the value of the real property, securing the loans in our portfolios. Additionally, if insurance obtained by our borrowers is insufficient to cover any losses sustained to the collateral, or if insurance coverage is otherwise unavailable to our borrowers, the collateral securing our loans may be negatively impacted by climate change, natural disasters and related events, which could impact our financial condition and results of operations. Further, the effects of climate change may negatively impact regional and local economic activity, which could lead to an adverse effect on our customers and impact the communities in which we operate. Overall, climate change, its effects and the resulting, unknown impact could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Other Risks 
 
 We may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or on terms acceptable to us. 
 
 We are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. We believe the net proceeds of our recent initial public offering will be sufficient to permit us to maintain regulatory compliance for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, we may elect to raise more capital to support our business or to finance acquisitions, if any, or we may otherwise elect or be required to raise additional capital in the future. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. We cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, or if the terms of such a capital raise are not advantageous, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
 Increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks. 
 
 Companies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance ESG practices and disclosure. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to the environment, health and safety, diversity, labor conditions and human rights. Increased ESG related compliance costs could result in increases to our overall operational costs. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our reputation, ability to do business with certain partners, and our stock price. New government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure. 
 
 There may be future sales of additional common stock or preferred stock or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
 
 We are not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities. The market value of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by us of a large number of shares of common stock or preferred stock or similar securities in the market or the perception that such sales could occur. 
 
 42 

Our board of directors is authorized to allow us to issue additional common stock, as well as classes or series of preferred stock, generally without any action on the part of the stockholders. In addition, the board has the power, generally without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights and preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends or upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our business and other terms. If we issue additional preferred stock in the future that has a preference over the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or if we issue additional preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock, the rights of holders of the common stock or the market value of the common stock could be adversely affected. 
 
 You may not receive dividends on our common stock. 
 
 Holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. The declaration and payment of future cash dividends will be subject to, among other things, regulatory restrictions, our then current and projected consolidated operating results, financial condition, tax considerations, future growth plans, general economic conditions, and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. Richmond Mutual Bancorporation will depend primarily upon the proceeds it retained from the offering as well as earnings of First Bank Richmond to provide funds to pay dividends on our common stock. The payment of dividends by First Bank Richmond also is subject to certain regulatory restrictions. Federal law generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be or continue to be undercapitalized, and dividends by a depository institution are subject to additional limitations. As a result, any payment of dividends in the future by Richmond Mutual Bancorporation may depend on First Bank Richmond s ability to satisfy these regulatory restrictions and its earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors. 

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 2. Properties 
 We currently operate out of our corporate headquarters/financial center and 12 full-service offices, all of which are owned by us, and one drive through facility used for existing customer transaction purposes only and one loan production office, both of which are leased. As of December 31, 2022, the net book value of our real properties, including land, was 13.7 million. See also Note 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the facilities are adequate and suitable for our current needs. We may open additional banking offices to better serve current clients and to attract new clients in subsequent years. 
 
 Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 We are not involved in any pending legal proceedings as a plaintiff or defendant other than routine legal proceedings occurring in the ordinary course of business, and at December 31, 2022, we were not involved in any legal proceedings, the outcome of which would be material to our financial condition or results of operations.

PART II 
 
 Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 The common stock of Richmond Mutual Bancorporation is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol "RMBI." There were approximately 453 shareholders of record of our common stock as of March 29, 2023. 
 Our cash dividend payout policy is reviewed regularly by management and the Board of Directors. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company paid cash dividends equal to 0.40 per common share. Any dividends declared and paid in the future would depend upon a number of factors, including capital requirements, our financial condition and results of operations, tax considerations, statutory and regulatory limitations, and general economic conditions. No assurances can be given that any dividends will be paid or that, if paid, will not be reduced or eliminated in future periods. Our future payment of dividends may depend, in part, upon receipt of dividends from First Bank Richmond, which are restricted by federal regulations. 
 Equity Compensation Plan Information. The equity compensation plan information presented in Part III, Item 12 of this Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.

 General 
 Our principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public, as well as brokered deposits, and investing those funds primarily in loans secured by first mortgages on owner-occupied, one- to four-family residences, a variety of consumer loans, direct financing leases, commercial and industrial loans, and loans secured by commercial and multi-family real estate. We also obtain funds by utilizing FHLB advances. Funds not invested in loans generally are invested in investment securities, including mortgage-backed and mortgage-related securities and agency and municipal bonds. 
 Our results of operations are primarily dependent on net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, which is the income that is earned on loans and investments, and interest expense, which is the interest that is paid on deposits and borrowings. Other significant sources of pre-tax income are service charges (mostly from service charges on deposit accounts and loan servicing fees), and fees from the sale of residential mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary market. We may also recognize income from the sale of investment securities. 
 At December 31, 2022, on a consolidated basis, we had 1.3 billion in assets, 961.7 million in loans, 1.0 billion in deposits and 133.0 million in stockholders equity. First Bank Richmond s risk-based capital ratio at December 31, 2022 was 14.3 , exceeding the 10.0 requirement for a well-capitalized institution. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we reported net income of 13.0 million, compared with net income of 11.1 million for 2021. 
 46 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of uncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We have reviewed our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our Board of Directors. 
 
 See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements. 
 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses . We maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses to cover probable incurred credit losses at the balance sheet date. Loan and lease losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in our judgment, should be charged-off. A provision for loan and lease losses is charged to operations based on our periodic evaluation of the necessary allowance balance. 
 We have an established process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses. The determination of the allowance is inherently subjective, as it requires significant estimates, including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on other classified loans and pools of homogeneous loans, and consideration of past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions and other factors, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. 
 Securities . Under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Codification Topic 320 (ASC 320), Investments-Debt, investment securities must be classified as held to maturity, available for sale or trading. Management determines the appropriate classification at the time of purchase. The classification of securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities. Debt securities are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and we have the ability to hold the securities to maturity. Securities not classified as held to maturity are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized holding gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income and which do not affect earnings until realized. 
 The fair values of our securities are generally determined by reference to quoted prices from reliable independent sources utilizing observable inputs. Certain of our fair values of securities are determined using models whose significant value drivers or assumptions are unobservable and are significant to the fair value of the securities. These models are utilized when quoted prices are not available for certain securities or in markets where trading activity has slowed or ceased. When quoted prices are not available and are not provided by third party pricing services, management judgment is necessary to determine fair value. As such, fair value is determined using discounted cash flow analysis models, incorporating default rates, estimation of prepayment characteristics and implied volatilities. 
 We evaluate all securities on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic conditions warrant additional evaluations, for determining if any other-than-temporary-impairments OTTI exist pursuant to guidelines established in ASC 320. In evaluating the possible impairment of securities, consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and our ability and intent to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. In analyzing an issuer s financial condition, we may consider whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies or government sponsored agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and the results of reviews of the issuer s financial condition. 
 If management determines that an investment experienced an OTTI, we must then determine the amount of the OTTI to be recognized in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss, the OTTI will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors. The amount of OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings. The amount of the OTTI related to other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. The previous 
 47 

amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment. If management intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss, the OTTI will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. Any recoveries related to the value of these securities are recorded as an unrealized gain (as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity) and not recognized in income until the security is ultimately sold. 
 From time to time we may dispose of an impaired security in response to asset/liability management decisions, future market movements, business plan changes, or if the net proceeds can be reinvested at a rate of return that is expected to recover the loss within a reasonable period of time. 
 Deferred Tax Asset . We have evaluated our deferred tax asset to determine if it is more likely than not that the asset will be utilized in the future. Our most recent evaluation has determined that we will more likely than not be able to utilize our remaining deferred tax asset. 
 
 Management Strategy 
 We are a community-oriented financial institution dedicated to serving the needs of customers in our primary market area. Our commitment is to offer a full array of consumer and commercial banking products and services to meet the needs of our customers. We offer mortgage lending products to qualified borrowers to give them the broadest access to home ownership in our markets. We offer commercial lending products and services tailored to complement their businesses. Our goal is to maintain asset quality while continuing to build our strong capital position while looking for growth opportunities in the markets we serve. To achieve these goals, we will focus on the following strategies: 
 Lending. We believe that commercial lending offers an opportunity to enhance our profitability while managing credit, interest rate and operational risk. We seek quality commercial loan opportunities in our existing markets and purchase loan participations that complement our existing portfolios. We will continue to focus our efforts on our existing markets as well as to further develop the Columbus, Ohio market through our loan production office. We anticipate that the majority of our commercial and multi-family real estate and commercial construction loan originations will range in size from 1.0 million to 8.0 million, while the majority of our commercial and industrial loan originations will range in size from 250,000 to 1.5 million. At December 31, 2022, our commercial loan portfolio, which includes commercial and multi-family real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans and construction loans, totaled 663.3 million, or 68.0 of total loans and leases, with approximately 210.1 million of these loans, or 21.6 of our total loans and leases, located in the Columbus, Ohio market. 
 Deposit Services. Deposits are our primary source of funds for lending and investment. We intend to continue to focus on increasing core deposits (which we define as all deposits except for certificates of deposit of 250,000 or more and brokered certificates of deposit) in our primary market area, with a particular emphasis on noninterest-bearing deposits. We will continue to enhance our offering of retail deposit products to maintain and increase our market share, while continuing to build our product offering of commercial deposit products to strengthen our relationships with our business customers. Core deposits represented 69.9 of our total deposits as of December 31, 2022. 
 Balance Sheet Growth . As a result of our efforts to build our management and infrastructure, we believe we are well-positioned to increase the size of our balance sheet without a proportional increase in overhead expense or operating risk. Accordingly, we intend to increase, on a managed basis, our assets and liabilities, particularly loans and deposits. 
 Asset Quality. We believe that strong asset quality is a key to long-term financial success. Our strategy for credit risk management focuses on an experienced team of credit professionals, well-defined credit policies and procedures, appropriate loan underwriting criteria and active credit monitoring. Our non-performing loans to total loans ratio was 0.94 at December 31, 2022. 
 Capital Position. Our policy has always been to protect the safety and soundness of First Bank Richmond through credit and operational risk management, balance sheet strength, and sound operations. The end result of these activities has been a capital ratio in excess of the well-capitalized standards set by our regulators. We believe that maintaining a strong capital position safeguards the long-term interests of First Bank Richmond. 
 Interest Rate Risk Management. Changes in interest rates are our primary market risk as our balance sheet is almost entirely comprised of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. As such, fluctuations in interest rates have a significant impact not only upon our net income but also upon the cash flows related to those assets and liabilities and the market value of our assets and liabilities. In order to maintain what we believe to be acceptable levels of net interest income in 
 48 

varying interest rate environments, we actively manage our interest rate risk and assume a moderate amount of interest rate risk consistent with board policies.

Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 Compared to December 31, 2021 
 
 General. Total assets increased 61.0 million, or 4.8 , to 1.3 billion at December 31, 2022 from December 31, 2021. This increase was driven by a 128.8 million, or 15.5 , increase in the loan and lease portfolio, net of allowance for loan and lease losses, partially offset by a 75.0 million, or 20.5 decrease in investment securities, and a 7.1 million, or 30.9 decrease in cash and cash equivalents. The increase in loans was primarily funded by a 105.1 million, or 11.7 , increase in deposits. 
 
 Loans and Leases. Our loan and lease portfolio, net of allowance for loan and lease losses, increased 128.8 million, or 15.5 , to 961.7 million at December 31, 2022 from 832.8 million at December 31, 2021. The majority of the growth occurred in construction and development loans which increased 46.2 million, or 49.4 , to 139.9 million, and in commercial real estate loans which increased 36.9 million, or 14.1 , to 298.1 million at December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year. We also experienced a 17.5 million, or 16.3 , increase in multi-family loans, a 15.8 million, or 11.2 , increase in residential real estate loans (including home equity lines of credit), a 6.7 million, or 5.3 , increase in direct financing leases, and a 5.1 million, or 32.3 , increase in consumer loans. Commercial and industrial loans increased by 700,000, or 0.7 at December 31, 2022 compared to a year ago, in spite of an 8.4 million, or 89.4 , decrease in outstanding PPP loans to 994,000 at December 31, 2022 from 9.4 million at December 31, 2021. 
 
 The following table presents information concerning the composition of our loan and lease portfolio in dollar amounts and in percentages (before deductions for loans in process, deferred fees and discounts and allowances for loan and lease losses) as of the dates indicated.

 _____________________ 
 (1) Includes 4.7 million and 3.2 million of loans secured by second mortgages on residential properties at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Nonperforming loans and leases, consisting of nonaccrual loans and leases and accruing loan and leases more than 90 days past due, totaled 9.2 million, or 0.94 , of total loans and leases at December 31, 2022, compared to 8.0 million, or 
 51 

0.95 of total loans and leases at December 31, 2021. The increase in nonperforming loans was primarily attributable to a 1.3 million increase in commercial and industrial loans, primarily due to one loan of 1.3 million secured by business assets and a second mortgage past due more than 90 days and still accruing. At December 31, 2022, our largest nonperforming loan was a 4.9 million nonaccrual commercial construction and development loan that is currently subject to litigation between the developer and other parties. At the time of origination, this loan had a loan to value ratio of 73 . 
 
 At December 31, 2022, TDRs totaled 428,000 compared to 456,000 at December 31, 2021, all of which were nonaccrual loans at those dates. 
 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses. Our allowance for loan and lease losses increased 305,000, or 2.5 , to 12.4 million at December 31, 2022 from 12.1 million at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, the allowance for loan and lease losses totaled 1.27 of total loans and leases outstanding compared to 1.43 at December 31, 2021. Net charge-offs during the year ended 2022 were 295,000, or 0.03 of average loans and leases outstanding, compared to net recoveries of 92,000, or 0.01 of average loans and leases outstanding, during 2021. The allowance for loan and lease losses to non-performing loans and leases was 135.3 at December 31, 2022, compared to 150.8 at December 31, 2021. 
 Management regularly analyzes conditions within its geographic markets and evaluates its loan and lease portfolio. The Company evaluated its exposure to potential loan and lease losses as of December 31, 2022, which evaluation included consideration of a potential recession due to inflation, rising interest rates, stock market volatility, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Credit metrics are being reviewed and stress testing is being performed on the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis. Potentially higher risk segments of the portfolio, such as hotels and restaurants, continue to be closely monitored. 
 Investment Securities. Investment securities decreased 75.0 million, or 20.5 , to 291.6 million at December 31, 2022, from 366.6 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a 61.4 million downward mark-to-market adjustment in the fair value of securities available for sale and proceeds from maturities and paydowns of securities of 32.2 million, partially offset by the purchase of 22.5 million in securities. 
 Deposits. Total deposits increased 105.1 million, or 11.7 , to 1.0 billion at December 31, 2022 from 900.2 million at December 31, 2021. This increase in deposits was primarily due to an increase in brokered deposits of 136.1 million, or 111.8 , as well as an increase in savings and money market accounts of 26.7 million, or 10.5 . These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 7.9 million, or 6.9 , in noninterest-bearing demand deposits, a 6.9 million, or 4.2 , decrease in interest-bearing demand deposits, and a 42.9 million, or 17.5 , decrease in non-brokered time deposits. At December 31, 2022, brokered deposits equaled 25.7 of total deposits compared to 121.8 million, or 13.5 of total deposits at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, noninterest-bearing deposits totaled 106.4 million, or 10.6 of total deposits, compared to 114.3 million, or 12.7 , of total deposits at December 31, 2021. 
 Borrowings. Total borrowings, consisting solely of FHLB advances, totaled 180.0 million at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 Stockholders Equity. Stockholders equity totaled 133.0 million at December 31, 2022, a decrease of 47.5 million, or 26.3 , from December 31, 2021. The decrease in stockholders equity from December 31, 2021 primarily was the result of a reduction in accumulated comprehensive income of 48.5 million due to a greater mark-to-market adjustment to the investment portfolio as a result of higher interest rates, the payment of 4.4 million in dividends to Company stockholders, and the repurchase of 9.9 million of Company common stock, partially offset by net income of 13.0 million. First Bank Richmond s tangible common equity ratio and its risk-based capital ratios exceeded well-capitalized levels as defined by all regulatory standards as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 
 General . Net income totaled 13.0 million for 2022 compared to 11.1 million in 2021, an increase of 1.8 million or 16.3 . The increase in net income was due to a 5.9 million, or 12.9 , increase in interest income, an 830,000, or 58.0 , reduction in the provision for loan losses, partially offset by a 2.5 million, or 33.0 , increase in interest expense, a 549,000, or 10.1 , decrease in non-interest income, and a 1.5 million, or 5.3 , increase in non-interest expense. 
 Interest Income . Total interest income for 2022 increased 5.9 million or 12.9 over 2021. The increase primarily was a result of a 111.2 million increase in the average balance of loans and leases outstanding year-over-year, partially offset by a 19 basis point decrease in average yield on loans and leases, resulting in a 4.0 million increase in interest income on loans and leases. Interest earned on investment securities, including FHLB stock, increased 1.8 million, or 34.3 , due to a 58 basis point increase in the average yield, partially offset by a 5.5 million decrease in the average balance of the portfolio. Interest on 
 52 

cash and cash equivalents increased 101,000 due to an 89 basis point increase in the average yield, partially offset by a 10.0 million decrease in average balances. 
 Interest Expense . Total interest expense increased 2.5 million, or 33.0 , to 10.2 million during 2022 compared to 7.7 million during 2021. The increase was the result of an increase in the average balance in all categories of interest-bearing liabilities, and a 12 basis point increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The average balance of savings and money market accounts increased 37.3 million, or 15.1 , to 284.7 million in 2022 compared to 247.4 million in 2021, while the rate paid on these accounts increased 25 basis points to 0.76 in 2022 from 0.51 in 2021, resulting in a 897,000 increase in interest expense. The average balance of interest-bearing checking accounts increased 10.3 million, or 6.6 , to 165.2 million in 2022 from 154.9 million in 2021, while the average rate paid on interest-bearing checking accounts increased nine basis points to 0.32 in 2022 from 0.23 in 2021, resulting in a 172,000 increase in interest expense. Average balances of certificates of deposit increased 97.0 million, or 33.8 in 2022 from 287.1 million in 2021, while the rate paid on certificates of deposit remained the same in 2022 as 2021, resulting in a 1.1 million increase in interest expense. The growth in certificates of deposit balances was due to a 112.7 million, or 231.6 increase in brokered certificates of deposit. The average rate paid on brokered certificates of deposit increased to 1.17 in 2022 from 0.72 in 2021. Interest expense on borrowings, consisting solely of FHLB advances, increased 345,000, or 12.6 , due to an 18 basis point increase on the average rate paid to 1.72 in 2022 from 1.54 in 2021, and a 1.4 million, or 0.8 , increase in the average balance of borrowings to 180.0 million in 2022 from 178.5 million in 2021. 
 Net Interest Income . Net interest income before provision for loan and lease losses increased 3.4 million, or 8.9 , to 41.6 million in 2022 compared to 38.2 million in 2021, primarily due to a five basis point increase in the average interest rate spread, partially offset by the growth in average interest-bearing liabilities exceeding the growth in average interest-bearing assets. Our net interest margin in 2022 was 3.36 , an increase of two basis points compared to 2021. During the year, the recognition of deferred fees related to PPP loan forgiveness had a positive impact on the net interest margin. The average yield on PPP loans was 9.41 , including the recognition of deferred fees, resulting in a positive impact to loan yield of three basis points during 2022, compared to an average yield of 8.62 with a positive impact to loan yield of 15 basis points during 2021. 
 Since March 2022, in response to inflation, the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC of the Federal Reserve System has increased the target range for the federal funds rate by 425 basis points, including 125 basis points during the fourth quarter of 2022, to a range of 4.25 to 4.50 . While net interest income benefited from the repricing impact of the higher interest rate environment on earning asset yields, the benefits were offset by the higher cost of interest-bearing deposit accounts and borrowings which tend to be shorter in duration than our assets and re-price or reset faster than assets. 
 Provision for Loan and Lease Losses . The provision for loan and lease losses in 2022 was 600,000, an 830,000, or 58.0 , decrease compared to 1.4 million in 2021. The provision for loan and lease losses reflects the amount required to maintain the allowance for loan and leases losses at an appropriate level based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of collective and individual loss reserves. The provision for loan and leases losses for the current year primarily reflects loan growth and, to a lesser extent, a deterioration in forecasted economic conditions and indicators utilized to estimate loan and leases losses, partially offset by an improvement in the level of adversely classified loans. Beginning in 2023, we will be required to adopt CECL, the FASB s standard on accounting for expected credit losses. The CECL impairment model is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses, which is what we currently use. Under the new guidance, we must recognize our estimate of expected credit losses as an allowance. The CECL model incorporates forward-looking information and results in earlier loss recognition than incurred loss models do. Future assessments of the expected credit losses on loans and leases will not only be impacted by changes to the reasonable and supportable forecast, but will also include an updated assessment of qualitative factors, as well as consideration of any required changes in the reasonable and supportable forecast and the period following the reasonable and supportable forecast period through the end of the asset s contractual life. As of the CECL adoption and day one measurement date of January 1, 2023, the Company expects to record a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings, net of income taxes, on the consolidated balance sheet. The allowance will increase between 2.3 million and 3.0 million from December 31, 2022. CECL also requires the establishment of a reserve for potential losses from unfunded commitments that is recorded in other liabilities, separate from the allowance for credit losses, which will be approximately 1.8 million to 2.5 million. Also, as required by CECL, the Company reviewed the held-to-maturity debt securities portfolio and determined the expected losses were immaterial. 
 Net charge-offs in 2022 were 295,000 compared to net recoveries of 92,000 in 2021. The allowance as a percentage of the total loan and lease portfolio was 1.27 at year-end 2022, compared to 1.43 at year-end 2021. Net charge-offs in 2022 equaled 0.03 of total average loans and leases outstanding compared to net recoveries of 0.01 of total average loans and leases outstanding in 2021. 
 
 53 

Non-interest Income . Total non-interest income decreased 549,000, or 10.1 , to 4.9 million for 2022 compared to 5.4 million for 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in net gains on loan and lease sales of 1.8 million, or 73.9 , to 639,000 in 2022 from 2.5 million in 2021, as mortgage banking activity declined due to lower refinancing activity, a lower supply of houses for sale in the Bank s market area, and increases in residential mortgage rates. Net gains on securities decreased 56,000, or 100.0 , as no securities were sold during 2022 compared to 5.3 million of securities sold in 2021. Partially offsetting these decreases were loan and lease servicing fees, including mortgage servicing right impairment, of 862,000 during 2022, an increase of 946,000 compared to a loss of 84,000 during 2021, primarily due to a recovery of mortgage servicing rights of 380,000 in 2022 as a result of continued rising interest rates increasing the expected duration of our loans compared to recording a mortgage servicing rights impairment charge of 360,000 in 2021. Service charges on deposit accounts increased 168,000, or 19.1 , to 1.0 million during 2022 compared to 882,000 during 2021 as a result of higher overdraft fees and ATM fees. In addition, card fee income increased 123,000, or 11.3 , due to an overall increase in debit card usage and other income increased 81,000, or 7.9 , primarily due to increased wealth management income during 2022 compared to 2021. 
 Non-Interest Expenses . Total non-interest expense increased 1.5 million, or 5.3 , to 30.2 million during 2022 compared to 2021, with increases occurring in all non-interest expense categories other than equipment expenses and other expenses. 
 Salaries and employee benefits increased 335,000, or 1.8 , to 18.5 million in 2022 from 18.1 million in 2021, primarily due to increases in salaries resulting from the net addition of eight full-time-equivalent hires in 2022 and annual merit increases, partially offset by a 665,000 expense recorded in 2021 to complete the termination of the Company s defined benefit pension plan which was not required in 2022. Data processing expenses increased 532,000, or 24.4 , to 2.7 million in 2022 from 2.2 million in 2021 due to higher software expenses associated with the Company's continued investment in digital banking services. Legal and professional fees increased 193,000, or 15.8 , to 1.4 million during 2022, compared to 1.2 million during 2021 due to expenses associated with the formation of First Insurance Management, Inc. Deposit insurance expenses increased 193,000, or 64.1 , to 494,000 during 2022, compared to 301,000 during 2021 due to lower capital levels, a change in our loan composition and a greater use of wholesale certificates of deposit during 2022. Net occupancy expenses increased 188,000, or 15.2 , to 1.4 million during 2022, compared to 1.2 million during 2021, due to increased building maintenance expenses. 
 
 These increases in non-interest expense were partially offset by a 38,000, or 2.9 , decrease in equipment expenses to 1.3 million in 2022 compared to 2021 due to depreciation charges, and a 12,000 decrease in other expenses. 
 
 Income Tax Expense . Income tax expense increased 348,000 in 2022 compared to 2021. This increase in income tax expense was primarily due to pretax income increasing 2.2 million, or 16.0 , partially offset by a lower effective tax rate in 2022. The effective tax rate for the year ended 2022 was 17.7 compared to 17.9 in 2021.

Rate/Volume Analysis 
 The following schedule presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. It distinguishes between the changes related to outstanding balances and that due to the changes in interest rates. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (i.e., changes in volume multiplied by old rate) and (ii) changes in rate (i.e., changes in rate multiplied by old volume). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate. Years Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 2021 Increase/ (decrease) due to Total increase/ (decrease) Volume Rate (In thousands) Interest-earning assets: Loans and leases receivable 5,713 (1,698) 4,015 Securities (86) 1,776 1,690 FHLB stock 17 109 126 Cash and cash equivalents and other (22) 123 101 Total interest-earning assets 5,622 310 5,932 Interest-bearing liabilities: Savings and money market accounts 189 708 897 Interest-bearing checking accounts 24 148 172 Certificate accounts 1,123 1,123 Borrowings 22 323 345 Total interest-bearing liabilities 1,358 1,179 2,537 Change in net interest income 3,395 
 
 Capital and Liquidity 
 
 Capital. Shareholders' equity totaled 133.0 million at December 31, 2022 and 180.5 million at December 31, 2021. In addition to net income of 13.0 million, other sources of capital during 2022 included 799,000 related to the allocation of ESOP shares during the year and 1.5 million related to stock-based compensation. Uses of capital during 2022 included 4.4 million of dividends paid on common stock, other comprehensive loss, net of tax, of 48.5 million and 9.9 million of stock repurchases. The accumulated other comprehensive loss component of shareholders' equity was caused by changes to the unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities as a result of the increase in market interest rates during 2022. 
 We paid regular quarterly cash dividends of 0.10 per common share during 2022, and regular quarterly cash dividends of 0.07 per share and a special dividend of 0.50 per share during 2021. This equates to a dividend payout ratio of 34.0 in 2022 and 83.8 in 2021. We currently expect to continue the current practice of paying quarterly cash dividends on common stock subject to the Board of Directors' discretion to modify or terminate this practice at any time and for any reason without prior notice. Assuming continued payment during 2023 at the current dividend rate of 0.10 per share, our average total dividend paid each quarter would be approximately 1.2 million based on the number of our current outstanding shares at December 31, 2022. The amount of dividends, if any, we may pay may be limited as more fully discussed in "Note 17: Regulatory Capital" in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 
 56 

Stock Repurchase Plans. From time to time, our board of directors has authorized stock repurchase plans. In general, stock-repurchase plans allow us to proactively manage our capital position and return excess capital to shareholders. On May 19, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized a third stock repurchase program for up to 1,263,841 shares, or approximately 10 of its outstanding shares. This repurchase program expired on July 3, 2022 with a total of 817,984 shares being repurchased. On July 21, 2022, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a fourth stock repurchase program for up to 1,184,649 shares, or approximately 10 of its then outstanding shares. The fourth stock repurchase program will expire in July 2023, unless completed sooner. See Part II, Item 5 - Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. 
 Liquidity. Liquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due. The liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan requests, to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities. The ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of its balance sheet structure, its ability to liquidate assets and its access to alternative sources of funds. The objective of our liquidity management is to manage cash flow and liquidity reserves so that they are adequate to fund our operations and to meet obligations and other commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. We seek to achieve this objective and ensure that funding needs are met by maintaining an appropriate level of liquid funds through asset/liability management, which includes managing the mix and time to maturity of financial assets and financial liabilities on our balance sheet. Our liquidity position is enhanced by our ability to raise additional funds as needed in the wholesale markets. 
 Asset liquidity is provided by liquid assets which are readily marketable or pledgeable or which will mature in the near future. Liquid assets generally include cash, interest-bearing deposits in banks, securities available for sale, maturities and cash flow from securities held to maturity, sales of fixed rate residential mortgage loans in the secondary market, and federal funds sold and resell agreements. Liability liquidity generally is provided by access to funding sources which include core deposits and advances from the FHLB and other borrowing relationships with third party financial institutions. 
 Our liquidity position is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate. Liquidity risk management is an important element in our asset/liability management process. We regularly model liquidity stress scenarios to assess potential liquidity outflows or funding problems resulting from economic disruptions, volatility in the financial markets, unexpected credit events or other significant occurrences deemed problematic by management. These scenarios are incorporated into our contingency funding plan, which provides the basis for the identification of our liquidity needs. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 5.6 million held in an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve. We also have the ability to borrow funds as a member of the FHLB. As of December 31, 2022, based upon available, pledgeable collateral, our total remaining borrowing capacity with the FHLB was approximately 66.7 million. Furthermore, at December 31, 2022, we had approximately 198.5 million in securities that were unencumbered by a pledge and could be used to support additional borrowings through repurchase agreements or the Federal Reserve discount window, as needed. As of December 31, 2022, management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources or operations. In addition, management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity that would have a material adverse effect on us. 
 In the ordinary course of business we have entered into contractual obligations and have made other commitments to make future payments. Refer to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for the expected timing of such payments as of December 31, 2022. These include payments related to (i) long-term borrowings (Note 10 - Federal Home Loan Bank Advances), (ii) time deposits with stated maturity dates (Note 9 - Deposits) and (iii) commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit (Note 13 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities). 
 Richmond Mutual Bancorporation is a separate legal entity from First Bank Richmond and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to its own operating expenses, Richmond Mutual Bancorporation is responsible for paying for any stock repurchases, dividends declared to its stockholders and other general corporate expenses. Since Richmond Mutual Bancorporation is a holding company and does not conduct operations, its primary sources of liquidity are interest on investment securities purchased with proceeds from our initial public offering, dividends up streamed from First Bank Richmond and borrowings from outside sources. Banking regulations may limit the amount of dividends that may be to us paid by First Bank Richmond. "Note 17: Regulatory Capital" in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 and "How We Are Regulated - Dividends" contained in Part I, Item I of this Form 10-K. At December 31, 2022, Richmond Mutual Bancorporation, on an unconsolidated basis, had 26.2 million in cash, noninterest-bearing deposits and liquid investments generally available for its cash needs.

 Regulatory Capital Requirements. First Bank Richmond is subject to minimum capital requirements imposed by the FDIC. The FDIC may require us to have additional capital above the specific regulatory levels if it believes we are subject to increased risk due to asset problems, high interest rate risk and other risks. At December 31, 2022, First Bank Richmond s regulatory capital exceeded the FDIC regulatory requirements, and First Bank Richmond was well-capitalized under regulatory prompt corrective action standards. Consistent with our goals to operate a sound and profitable organization, our policy is for First Bank Richmond to maintain well-capitalized status. 
 Actual Minimum for Capital Adequacy Purposes Minimum to be Categorized as "Well-Capitalized" Under Prompt Corrective Action Provisions Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio As of December 31, 2022 (Dollars in thousands) Total risk-based capital (to risk weighted assets) 164,804 14.3 92,134 8.0 115,168 10.0 Tier 1 risk-based capital (to risk weighted assets) 152,391 13.2 69,101 6.0 92,134 8.0 Common equity tier 1 capital (to risk weighted assets) 152,391 13.2 51,826 4.5 74,859 6.5 Tier 1 leverage (core) capital (to adjusted tangible assets) 152,391 11.2 54,421 4.0 68,026 5.0 As of December 31, 2021 Total risk-based capital (to risk weighted assets) 169,589 17.3 78,590 8.0 98,238 10.0 Tier 1 risk-based capital (to risk weighted assets) 157,481 16.0 58,943 6.0 78,590 8.0 Common equity tier 1 capital (to risk weighted assets) 157,481 16.0 44,207 4.5 63,855 6.5 Tier 1 leverage (core) capital (to adjusted tangible assets) 157,481 12.5 50,284 4.0 62,855 5.0 
 Pursuant to the capital regulations of the FDIC and the other federal banking agencies, First Bank Richmond must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional common equity tier 1 CET1 capital greater than 2.5 of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels of risk-based CET1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, repurchasing shares, and paying discretionary bonuses. At December 31, 2022, the Bank s CET1 capital exceeded the required capital conservation buffer. 
 For a bank holding company with less than 3.0 billion in assets, the capital guidelines apply on a bank only basis and the Federal Reserve Board expects the holding company s subsidiary banks to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations. If Richmond Mutual Bancorporation was subject to regulatory guidelines for bank holding companies with 3.0 billion or more in assets, at December 31, 2022, it would have exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. 
 
 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Management of Market Risk 
 Our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk as the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. A principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. Our Asset/Liability Committee is responsible for 
 58 

evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our balance sheet, for determining the appropriate level of risk given our business strategy, operating environment, capital and liquidity, and for managing this risk consistent with our policies and guidelines. 
 Our strategy attempts to manage the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income, which is our primary source of earnings. Among the actions taken are: 
 Originate commercial and commercial real estate loans, which generally have shorter terms and higher yields than owner-occupied one-to four-family residential real estate loans. 
 Sell substantially all longer-term fixed-rate residential real estate loans in the secondary market. 
 Cultivate stable deposit relationships with business and consumer customers. 
 Acquire longer-term, fixed-rate borrowings when appropriate to reduce our sensitivity to changing interest rates. 
 Interest Rate Risk. The Asset/Liability Committee monitors First Bank Richmond s interest rate risk IRR position and meets quarterly to review pricing, liquidity needs, and to assess our interest rate risk. We currently utilize a third-party modeling program prepared quarterly to evaluate our sensitivity to changing interest rates. 
 The table below sets forth, as of December 31, 2022, the calculation of the estimated changes in our net interest income that results from the designated immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve.

 _________________________ 
 (1) Assumes an immediate uniform change in interest rates at all maturities. 
 59 

Economic Value of Equity. Interest rate risk is monitored through the use of a simulation model that also estimates the amounts by which the fair value of our assets and liabilities (Economic Value of Equity, or EVE would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. The reports that are prepared quarterly in the simulation assist the Asset/Liability Committee in measuring and monitoring interest rate risk over a longer-term than the interest rate risk model does when looking at earnings simulations. 
 The table below sets forth, as of December 31, 2022, the estimated changes in our EVE that would result from instantaneous changes in market interest rates. This table assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities.

 _____________________ 
 (1) Assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities. 
 (2) EVE is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. 
 In evaluating our exposure to interest rate movements, certain shortcomings inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing tables must be considered. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or re-pricing periods, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a significant change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed above. Finally, the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase. We consider all of these factors in monitoring our exposure to interest rate risk. 
 The Asset/Liability committee annually reviews reinvestment rate assumptions, along with the betas used in the IRR and EVE modeling. We generally manage our balance sheet based on potential changes to net interest income under various rate scenarios. The EVE ratio is useful in long-term planning; but management gives more weight to changes in net interest income under various rate scenarios. IRR projections are tested annually, and the model is subject to a third-party review annually.

 (Table Dollar Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts) 
 
 Note 1: 
 million. In conjunction with the corporate reorganization, the Company contributed shares and million of cash to a newly formed charitable foundation, First Bank Richmond, Inc. Community Foundation (the Foundation ). Additionally, a liquidation account was established for the benefit of certain depositors of the Bank in an amount equal to the MHC s ownership interest in the retained earnings of RMB-Delaware as of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2019. 
 First Bank is an Indiana state-chartered commercial bank headquartered in Richmond, Indiana. The bank was originally established in 1887 as an Indiana state-chartered mutual savings and loan association and in 1935 converted to a federal mutual savings and loan association, operating under the name First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Richmond. In 1993, the bank converted to a state-chartered mutual savings bank and changed its name to First Bank Richmond, S.B. In 1998, the bank, in connection with its non-stock mutual holding company reorganization, converted to a national bank charter operating as First Bank Richmond, National Association. In July 2007, Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Delaware, the bank s then current holding company, acquired Mutual Federal Savings Bank headquartered in Sidney, Ohio. Mutual Federal Savings Bank was operated independently as a separately chartered, wholly owned subsidiary of Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Delaware until 2016 when it was combined with the bank through an internal merger transaction that consolidated both banks into a single, more efficient commercial bank charter. In 2017, the bank converted to an Indiana state-chartered commercial bank and changed its name to First Bank Richmond. The former Mutual Federal Savings Bank continues to operate in Ohio under the name Mutual Federal, a division of First Bank Richmond. 
 First Bank generates commercial, mortgage and consumer loans and leases, and receives deposits from customers located primarily in Wayne and Shelby Counties in Indiana, and Shelby, Miami, and Franklin Counties in Ohio. First Bank s loans and leases are generally secured by specific items of collateral including real property, consumer assets and business assets. When the word "loan" or "loans" is used in these financial statements it includes leases, unless the context indicates otherwise. 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, loan servicing rights, and fair values of financial instruments.

days past due unless the credit is well-secured and in process of collection. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. For all loan classes, the entire balance of the loan is considered past due if the minimum payment contractually required to be paid is not received by the contractual due date. For all loan classes, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. 
 68 

before returning a nonaccrual loan to accrual status. 
 When cash payments are received on impaired loans in each loan class, the Company records the payment as interest income unless collection of the remaining recorded principal amount is doubtful, at which time payments are used to reduce the principal balance of the loan. Troubled debt restructured loans recognize interest income on an accrual basis at the renegotiated rate if the loan is in compliance with the modified terms, no principal reduction has been granted and the loan has demonstrated the ability to perform in accordance with the renegotiated terms for a period of at least six months. 
 69 

. Management believes the three year historical loss experience methodology, on a weighted basis, is appropriate in the current economic environment. Other adjustments (qualitative/environmental considerations) for each segment may be added to the allowance for each loan segment after an assessment of internal or external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss or risk rating data. 
 A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due based on the loan s current payment status and the borrower s financial condition including available sources of cash flows. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for nonhomogeneous type loans such as commercial, nonowner residential and construction loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the loan s obtainable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. For impaired loans where the Company utilizes the discounted cash flows to determine the level of impairment, the Company includes the entire change in the present value of cash flows as bad debt expense. 
 The fair values of collateral dependent impaired loans are based on independent appraisals of the collateral. In general, the Company acquires an updated appraisal upon identification of impairment and annually thereafter for commercial, commercial real estate and multi-family loans. If the most recent appraisal is over a year old, and a new appraisal is not performed, due to lack of comparable values or other reasons, the existing appraisal is utilized and discounted based on the age of the appraisal, condition of the subject property, and overall economic conditions. After determining the collateral value as described, the fair value is calculated based on the determined collateral value, less selling expenses. The potential for outdated appraisal values is considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses through an analysis of various trends and conditions including the local economy, trends in charge-offs and delinquencies, etc. and the related qualitative adjustments assigned by the Company. 
 Segments of loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated for impairment based on the segment s historical loss experience adjusted for changes in trends, conditions and other relevant factors that affect repayment of the loans. Accordingly, the Company does not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment measurements, unless such loans are the subject of a restructuring agreement due to financial difficulties of the borrower. 
 In the course of working with borrowers, the Company may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain loans. In this scenario, the Company attempts to work-out an alternative payment schedule with the borrower in order to optimize collectability of the loan. Any loans that are modified are reviewed by the Company to identify if a troubled debt restructuring TDR has occurred, which is when, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties, the Company grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. Terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with its current financial status and the restructuring of the loan may include the transfer of assets from the borrower to satisfy the debt, a modification of loan terms, or a combination of the two. If such efforts by the Company do not result in a satisfactory arrangement, the loan is referred to legal counsel, at which time

asset impairment was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

modified loans outstanding under the CARES Act guidance. 
 The CARES Act also approved the Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP"), administered by the Small Business Administration ("SBA") with funding provided by financial institutions. The 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act approved a new round of PPP loans in 2021. The PPP provides loans to eligible businesses through financial institutions like First Bank, with loans being eligible for forgiveness of some or all of the principal amount by the SBA if the borrower meets certain requirements. The SBA guarantees repayment of the loans to First Bank if the borrower's loan is not forgiven and is then not repaid by the member. The Bank earns a 1 interest rate on PPP loans, plus a processing fee from the SBA for processing and originating a loan. The PPP expired on May 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, PPP loans outstanding totaled . 
 The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, which was enacted in April 2012, has made numerous changes to the federal securities laws to facilitate access to capital markets. Under the JOBS Act, a company with total annual gross revenues of less than 1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year qualifies as an emerging growth company. The Company qualifies as and has elected to be an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may elect to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company, but must make such election when the company is first required to file a registration statement. Such an election is irrevocable during the period a company is an emerging growth company. The Company has elected to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company. 
 million and million from December 31, 2022. CECL also requires the establishment of a reserve for potential losses from unfunded commitments that is recorded in other liabilities, separate from the allowance for credit losses, which will be approximately million to

 In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. This ASU applies to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") or other rate references expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The ASU permits an entity to make necessary modifications to eligible contracts or transactions without requiring contract remeasurement or reassessment of a previous accounting determination. This ASU is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2020-04 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
 In October 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-08, Receivables Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs . ASU No. 2020-08 clarifies that the Company should reevaluate whether a callable debt security is within the scope of paragraph 310-20-35-33 for each reporting period. ASU No. 2020-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU No. 2020-08 on January 1, 2021. The adoption of ASU No. 2020-08 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
 In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes . ASU No. 2019-12 provides that state franchise or similar taxes that are based, at least in part on an entity s income, be included in an entity s income tax recognized as income-based taxes. The ASU further clarifies that the effect of any change in tax laws or rates used in the computation of the annual effective tax rate are required to be reflected in the first interim period that includes the enactment date of the legislation. Technical changes to eliminate exceptions to Topic 740 related to intra-period tax allocations for entities with losses from continuing operations, deferred tax liabilities related to change in ownership of foreign entities, and interim-period tax allocations for businesses with losses where the losses are expected to be realized. The amendments in ASU No. 2019-12 are effective for public business entities with fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company adopted ASU No. 2019-12 on January 1, 2021. The adoption of ASU No. 2019-12 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
 In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement . This ASU contains some technical adjustments related to the fair value disclosure requirements of public companies. Included in this ASU is the additional disclosure requirement of unrealized gains and losses for the period in recurring level 3 fair value disclosures and the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs, among other technical changes. The Company adopted ASU No. 2018-13 on January 1, 2020. The adoption of ASU No. 2018-13 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases, at the commencement date: (1) a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis and (2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. For the Company, the amendments in this update became effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. Based on leases outstanding as of December 31, 2021, this standard did not have a material impact on the Company s balance sheet or income statement. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842), Targeted Improvements, which provide entities with an additional (and optional) transition method to adopt the new lease standard. Under this new transition method, an entity initially applies the new lease standard at the adoption date and recognizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. Consequently, an entity s reporting for the comparative periods presented in the financial statements in which it adopts the new lease standard will continue to be in accordance with current

The risk characteristics of each loan portfolio segment are as follows: 
 81 

segments - residential mortgage loans, brokered mortgage loans and personal loans. For residential mortgage loans that are secured by 1-4 family residences and are generally owner-occupied, the Company generally establishes a maximum loan-to-value ratio and requires private mortgage insurance if that ratio is exceeded. Brokered mortgages are purchased residential mortgage loans meeting the Company's criteria established for originating residential mortgage loans. Home equity loans are typically secured by a subordinate interest in 1-4 family residences, and consumer personal loans are secured by consumer personal assets, such as automobiles or recreational vehicles. Some consumer personal loans are unsecured, such as small installment loans and certain lines of credit. Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income of the borrowers, which can be impacted by economic conditions in their market areas, such as unemployment levels. Repayment can also be impacted by changes in property values on residential properties. Risk is mitigated by the fact that the loans are of smaller individual amounts and spread over a large number of borrowers.

 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, largely based on available tax planning strategies and its projections of future taxable income. Therefore, no valuation reserve was recorded at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning the evaluation of both positive and negative evidence, the forecasts of future income, applicable tax planning strategies and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions. Positive evidence includes current positive earnings trends and the probability that taxable income will be generated in future periods, while negative evidence includes any cumulative losses in the current year and prior two years and general business and economic trends. Failure to achieve sufficient projected taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets.

 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The subsidiary evaluates each customer's credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis.

 Following is a description of the valuation methodologies and inputs used for assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as the general classification of such assets pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. There have been no significant changes in the valuation techniques during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 Available-for-Sale Securities 
 Where quoted market prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy, which includes equity securities. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. Level 2 securities include agency securities, obligations of state and political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities, and SBA pools. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique widely used in the banking industry to value investment securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for specific investment securities but rather relying on the investment securities relationship to other benchmark quoted investment securities. In certain cases where Level 1 or Level 2 inputs are not available, securities are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy.

 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 An evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Act )) as of December 31, 2022, was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and several other members of our senior management. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures in effect as of December 31, 2022, were effective. We intend to continually review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and to improve the Company's controls and procedures over time and to correct any deficiencies that we may discover in the future. The goal is to ensure that senior management has timely access to all material financial and non-financial information concerning the Company's business. While we believe the present design of the disclosure controls and procedures is effective to achieve its goal, future events affecting its business may cause the Company to modify its disclosure controls and procedures. 
 (b) Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 
 The management of Richmond Mutual Bancorporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Act. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company's management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error and circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, we concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. 
 (c) Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(d), our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, also conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls may be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by override of the control. The design of any control procedure is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 105 

Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
