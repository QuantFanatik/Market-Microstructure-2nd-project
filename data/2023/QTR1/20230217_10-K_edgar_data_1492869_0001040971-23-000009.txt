EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 
 This report combines the annual reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 of SL Green Realty Corp. and SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to "SL Green Realty Corp.," the "Company" or "SL Green" mean SL Green Realty Corp. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P.; and references to "SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P.," the "Operating Partnership" or "SLGOP" mean SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P. and its consolidated subsidiaries. The terms "we," "our" and "us" mean the Company and all the entities owned or controlled by the Company, including the Operating Partnership. 
 The Company is a Maryland corporation which operates as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, and is the sole managing general partner of the Operating Partnership. As a general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Company has full, exclusive and complete responsibility and discretion in the day-to-day management and control of the Operating Partnership. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company owns 94.61 of the outstanding general and limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership and owns 9,200,000 Series I Preferred Units of the Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2022, noncontrolling investors held, in aggregate a 5.39 limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. We refer to these interests as the noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership. 
 The Company and the Operating Partnership are managed and operated as one entity. The financial results of the Operating Partnership are consolidated into the financial statements of the Company. The Company has no significant assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Substantially all of our assets are held by, and our operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the Company and the Operating Partnership are substantially the same. 
 Noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership, stockholders' equity of the Company and partners' capital of the Operating Partnership are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of the Company and those of the Operating Partnership. The common limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership not owned by the Company are accounted as noncontrolling interests, within mezzanine equity, in the Company's and the Operating Partnership's consolidated financial statements. 
 We believe combining the annual reports on Form 10-K of the Company and the Operating Partnership into this single report results in the following benefits: 
 Combined reports enhance investors' understanding of the Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 
 Combined reports eliminate duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation since a substantial portion of the Company's disclosure applies to both the Company and the Operating Partnership; and 
 Combined reports create time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 
 To help investors understand the significant differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership, this report presents the following separate sections for each of the Company and the Operating Partnership: 
 consolidated financial statements; and 
 the following notes to the consolidated financial statements: 
 Note 11, Noncontrolling Interests on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements; 
 Note 12, Stockholders' Equity of the Company; and 
 Note 13, Partners' Capital of the Operating Partnership; 
 
 This report also includes separate Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrants' Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, and Item 9A. Controls and Procedures sections and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications for each of the Company and the Operating Partnership, respectively, in order to establish that the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, in both their capacity as the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company and the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the general partner of the Operating Partnership, have made the requisite certifications and that the Company and the Operating Partnership are compliant with Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General 
 SL Green Realty Corp. is a self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, engaged in the acquisition, development, redevelopment, repositioning, ownership, management and operation of commercial real estate properties, principally office properties, located in the New York metropolitan area, principally in Manhattan, a borough of New York City. We were formed in June, 1997 for the purpose of continuing the commercial real estate business of S.L. Green Properties, Inc., our predecessor entity. S.L. Green Properties, Inc., which was founded in 1980 by Stephen L. Green, who serves as a member and the chairman emeritus of the Company's board of directors, had been engaged in the business of owning, managing, leasing, and repositioning office properties in Manhattan. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we owned the following interests in properties in the New York metropolitan area, primarily in midtown Manhattan. Our investments located outside of Manhattan are referred to as the Suburban properties: 
 Consolidated Unconsolidated Total Location Property Type Number of Properties Approximate Square Feet Number of Properties Approximate Square Feet Number of Properties Approximate Square Feet Weighted Average Occupancy (1) 
 Commercial: Manhattan Office 13 9,963,138 12 13,998,381 25 23,961,519 90.7 Retail 2 17,888 9 301,996 11 319,884 91.2 Development/Redevelopment (1) 5 1,685,215 3 2,746,241 8 4,431,456 N/A 20 11,666,241 24 17,046,618 44 28,712,859 90.7 Suburban Office 7 862,800 7 862,800 79.3 Total commercial properties 27 12,529,041 24 17,046,618 51 29,575,659 90.3 Residential: Manhattan Residential (2) 1 140,382 1 140,382 89.5 Total portfolio 28 12,669,423 24 17,046,618 52 29,716,041 90.3 
 (1) The weighted average occupancy for commercial properties represents the total occupied square feet divided by total square footage at acquisition. The weighted average occupancy for residential properties represents the total occupied units divided by total available units. Properties under construction are not included in the calculation of weighted average occupancy. 
 (2) As of December 31, 2022, we owned a building at 7 Dey Street / 185 Broadway that was comprised of approximately 140,382 square feet (unaudited) of residential space and approximately 50,206 square feet (unaudited) of office and retail space. For the purpose of this report, we have included this building in the number of residential properties we own. However, we have included only the residential square footage in the residential approximate square footage, and have listed the balance of the square footage as development square footage. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we also managed one office building owned by a third party encompassing approximately 0.3 million square feet, and held debt and preferred equity investments with a book value of 623.3 million, excluding debt and preferred equity investments and other financing receivables totaling 8.5 million that are included in balance sheet line items other than the Debt and preferred equity investments line item. 
 Our corporate offices are located in midtown Manhattan at One Vanderbilt Avenue, New York, New York 10017. As of December 31, 2022, we employed 1,137 employees, 303 of whom were employed in our corporate offices. We can be contacted at (212) 594-2700. We maintain a website at www.slgreen.com . On our website, you can obtain, free of charge, a copy of our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such material electronically with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. We have also made available on our website our audit committee charter, compensation committee charter, nominating and corporate governance committee charter, code of business conduct and ethics and corporate governance principles. We do not intend for information contained on our website to be part of this annual report on Form 10-K. The SEC maintains a website (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.

Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to the "Company," "SL Green," "we," "our" and "us" in this annual report means SL Green Realty Corp., a Maryland corporation, and one or more of its subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership, or, as the context may require, SL Green only or the Operating Partnership only, and "S.L. Green Properties" means S.L. Green Properties, Inc., a New York corporation, as well as the affiliated partnerships and other entities through which Stephen L. Green historically conducted commercial real estate activities. 
 
 Corporate Structure 
 In connection with the Company's initial public offering, or IPO, in August 1997, the Operating Partnership received a contribution of interests in real estate properties as well as a 95 economic, non-voting interest in the management, leasing and construction companies affiliated with S.L. Green Properties. We refer to these management, leasing and construction entities, which are owned by S.L. Green Management Corp, as the "Service Corporation." The Company is organized so as to qualify, and has elected to qualify as a REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. 
 Substantially all of our assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership. We are the sole managing general partner of the Operating Partnership, and as of December 31, 2022, we owned 94.61 of its economic interests. All of the management and leasing operations with respect to our wholly-owned properties are conducted through SL Green Management LLC, or Management LLC. The Operating Partnership owns 100 of Management LLC. 
 In order to maintain the Company's qualification as a REIT while realizing income from management, leasing and construction contracts with third parties and joint venture properties, all of these service operations are conducted through the S.L. Green Management Corp, or the Service Corporation, a consolidated variable interest entity. We, through our Operating Partnership, receive substantially all of the cash flow from the Service Corporation's operations. All of the voting common stock of the Service Corporation is held by an entity owned and controlled by Stephen L. Green, who serves as a member and as the chairman emeritus of the Company's Board of Directors. 
 
 Business and Growth Strategies 
 SL Green, Manhattan's largest owner of office real estate, is focused primarily on the acquisition, development, redevelopment, repositioning, ownership, management, and operation of Manhattan commercial properties, principally office properties. 
 Our primary business objective is to maximize the total return to stockholders, through net income attributable to common stockholders, funds from operations, or FFO, and through asset value appreciation. The commercial real estate expertise resulting from owning, operating, investing, developing, redeveloping and lending on real estate in Manhattan for many decades has enabled us to invest in a collection of premier office properties, selected retail and residential assets, and high-quality debt and preferred equity investments. 
 We are led by a strong, experienced management team that provides a foundation of skills in all aspects of real estate. It is with this team that we have achieved a market leading position in our targeted submarkets. 
 We seek to enhance the value of our company by executing strategies that include the following: 
 Leasing and property management, which capitalizes on our extensive presence and knowledge of the marketplaces in which we operate; 
 Acquiring properties and employing our local market skills to reposition these assets to create incremental cash flow and value appreciation; 
 Identifying properties well suited for development/redevelopment in order to maximize the value of those properties through development/redevelopment or reconfiguration to match current workplace, retail and housing trends; 
 Investing in debt and preferred equity positions that generate consistently strong risk-adjusted returns, increase the breadth of our market insight, foster key market relationships and source potential future investment opportunities; 
 Executing dispositions through sales or joint ventures that harvest embedded equity which has been generated through management's value enhancing activities; and 
 Maintaining a prudently levered, liquid balance sheet with consistent access to diversified sources of property level and corporate capital.

Table of Contents 

Leasing and Property Management 
 We seek to capitalize on our management's extensive knowledge of Manhattan and the New York metropolitan area and the needs of our tenants through proactive leasing and management programs, which include: (i) use of in-depth market experience resulting from managing and leasing tens of millions of square feet of office, retail and residential space since the Company was founded; (ii) careful tenant management, which results in a high tenant retention rate, long average lease terms and a manageable lease expiration schedule; (iii) utilization of an extensive network of third-party brokers to supplement our in-house leasing team; (iv) use of comprehensive building management analysis and planning; and (v) a commitment to tenant satisfaction by understanding and appreciating our tenant's businesses and the environment in which they are operating, while providing high quality tenant services at competitive rental rates. 
 Property Acquisitions 
 We acquire properties for long-term value appreciation and earnings growth. This strategy has resulted in capital gains that increase our investment capital base. In implementing this strategy, we continually evaluate potential acquisition opportunities. These opportunities may come from new properties as well as the acquisition of properties in which we already hold a joint venture interest or, from time to time, from our debt and preferred equity investments. 
 Through intimate knowledge of our market, we have developed an ability to source transactions with superior risk-adjusted returns by capturing off-market opportunities. In rising markets, we primarily seek to acquire strategic vacancies that provide the opportunity to take advantage of our exceptional leasing and repositioning capabilities to increase cash flow and property value. In stable or falling markets, we primarily target assets featuring credit tenancies with fully escalated in-place rents to provide cash flow stability near-term and the opportunity for increases over time. 
 We believe that we have many advantages over our competitors in acquiring core and non-core properties, both directly and through our joint venture program that includes a predominance of high-quality institutional investors. Those advantages include: (i) senior management's long-tenured experience leading a full-service, fully integrated real estate company focused, principally, on the Manhattan market; (ii) the ability to offer tax-efficient structures to sellers through the exchange of ownership interests, including units in our Operating Partnership; and (iii) the ability to underwrite and close transactions on an expedited basis even when the transaction involves a complicated structure. 
 Property Dispositions 
 We continually evaluate our portfolio to identify those properties that are most likely to meet our long-term earnings and cash flow growth objectives and contribute to increasing portfolio value. Properties that no longer meet our objectives are evaluated for sale or joint venture, to release equity created through management's value enhancement programs or to take advantage of attractive market valuations. 
 We seek to efficiently deploy the capital proceeds generated from these dispositions into other property acquisitions, development or redevelopment projects or debt and preferred equity investments that we expect will provide enhanced future capital gains and earnings growth opportunities. Management may also elect to utilize the capital proceeds from these dispositions to repurchase shares of our common stock, repay existing indebtedness of the Company or its subsidiaries, or increase cash liquidity. 
 Property Repositioning 
 Our extensive knowledge of the market in which we operate and our ability to efficiently plan and execute capital projects provide the expertise to enhance returns by repositioning properties that are underperforming. Many of the properties we own or seek to acquire feature unique architectural design elements or other amenities and characteristics that can be appealing to tenants when fully exploited. Our strategic investment in these properties, combined with our active management and pro-active leasing, provide the opportunity to creatively meet market needs and generate favorable returns. 
 Development / Redevelopment 
 Our constant interactions with tenants and other market participants keep us abreast of innovations in workplace layout, store design and smart living. We leverage this information to identify properties primed for development or redevelopment to meet these demands and unlock value. The expertise and relationships that we have built from managing complex construction projects in New York City and its surrounding areas allow us to cost efficiently add new and renovated assets of the highest quality and desirability to our operating portfolio.

Debt and Preferred Equity Investments 
 We invest in well-collateralized debt and preferred equity investments in the markets in which we operate, principally New York City, that generate attractive yields. See Note 5, "Debt and Preferred Equity Investments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Knowledge of our markets and our leasing and asset management expertise provide underwriting capabilities that enable a highly educated assessment of risk and return. The benefits of this investment program, which has a carefully managed aggregate size, include the following: 
 Our typical investments provide high current returns at conservative exposure levels and, in certain cases, the potential for future capital gains. Our expertise and operating capabilities provide both insight and operating skills that mitigate risk. 
 In certain instances, these investments may serve as a potential source of real estate acquisitions for us. Property owners may also provide us the opportunity to consider off-market transactions involving other properties because we have previously provided debt or preferred equity financing to them. 
 Our debt and preferred equity investment strategy is concentrated in Manhattan, which helps us gain market insight, awareness of upcoming investment opportunities and foster key relationships that may provide access to future investment opportunities. 
 Capital Resources 
 Our objective is to maintain multiple sources of efficient corporate and property level capital. This objective is supported by: 
 Property operations that generally provide stable cash flows through market cycles, long average lease terms, high credit quality tenants and superior leasing, operating and asset management skills; 
 Concentration of our activities in a Manhattan market that is consistently attractive to property investors and lenders through market cycles relative to other markets; 
 Maintaining strong corporate liquidity and careful management of future debt maturities; and 
 Maintaining access to corporate capital markets through balanced financing and investment activities that result in strong balance sheet and cash flow metrics. 
 
 Manhattan Office Market Overview 
 Manhattan is the largest office market in the United States containing more rentable square feet than the next four largest central business district office markets combined. According to Cushman and Wakefield Research Services as of December 31, 2022, Manhattan has a total office inventory of approximately 414.6 million square feet, including approximately 258.4 million square feet in midtown. The properties in our portfolio are primarily concentrated in some of Manhattan's most prominent midtown locations. 
 While the near-term addition of new supply to the Manhattan office inventory is expected to be nominal relative to the size of the overall market, we view new supply in locations near a variety of transportation options as a positive to the Manhattan office market given the older vintage of the majority of Manhattan s office inventory and the increasing desire of tenants to occupy new, high quality, efficient office space that provides for easy commutability for their employees.

Leasing activity in Manhattan improved significantly in 2022. According to Cushman and Wakefield Research Services, the total volume of leases signed in Manhattan for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 24.3 million and 18.6 million square feet, respectively. Manhattan's diverse tenant base is exemplified by the following tables, which show the percentage of leasing volume attributable to each industry:

 General Terms of Leases in the Manhattan Markets 
 Leases entered into for space in Manhattan typically contain terms that may not be contained in leases in other U.S. office markets. The initial term of leases entered into for space in Manhattan is generally seven to fifteen years. Tenants leasing space in excess of 10,000 square feet for an initial term of 10 years or longer often will negotiate an option to extend the term of the lease for one or two renewal periods, typically for a term of five years each. The base rent during the initial term often will provide for agreed-upon periodic increases over the term of the lease. Base rent for renewal terms is most often based upon the then fair market rental value of the premises as of the commencement date of the applicable renewal term (generally determined by binding arbitration in the event the landlord and the tenant are unable to mutually agree upon the fair market value), though base rent for a renewal period may be set at 95 of the then fair market rent. Very infrequently, leases may contain termination options whereby a tenant can terminate the lease obligation before the lease expiration date with payment of a penalty together with repayment of the unamortized portion of the landlord's transaction costs (e.g., brokerage commissions, free rent periods, tenant improvement allowances, etc.). 
 In addition to base rent, a tenant will generally also pay its pro rata share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses for the building over a base year, which is typically the year during which the term of the lease commences, based upon the tenant's proportionate occupancy of the building. In some smaller leases (generally less than 10,000 square feet), in lieu of paying additional rent based upon increases in building operating expenses, base rent will be increased each year during the lease term by a set percentage on a compounding basis (though the tenant will still pay its pro rata share of increases in real estate taxes over a base year). 
 Tenants typically receive a free rent period following commencement of the lease term, which in some cases may coincide with the tenant's construction period. 
 The landlord most often supplies electricity either on a sub-metered basis at the landlord's cost plus a fixed percentage or on a rent inclusion basis (i.e., a fixed fee is added to the base rent for electricity, which amount may increase based upon increases in electricity rates or increases in electrical usage by the tenant). Base building services, other than electricity, such as heat, air conditioning, freight elevator service during business hours and base building cleaning typically are provided at no additional cost, but are included in the building's operating expenses. The tenant will typically pay additional amounts only for services that exceed base building services or for services that are provided other than during normal business hours. 
 In a typical lease for a new tenant renting in excess of 10,000 square feet, the landlord will deliver the premises with existing improvements demolished. In such instances, the landlord will typically provide a tenant improvement allowance, which is a fixed sum that the landlord makes available to the tenant to reimburse the tenant for all or a portion of the tenant's initial construction of its premises. Such sum typically is payable as work progresses, upon submission by the tenant of invoices for the cost of construction and lien waivers. However, in certain leases (most often for relatively small amounts of space), the landlord will construct the premises for the tenant at a cost to the landlord not to exceed an agreed upon amount with the tenant paying any amount in excess of the agreed upon amount. In addition, landlords may rent space to a tenant that is "pre-built" (i.e., space that was constructed by the landlord in advance of lease signing and is ready to for the tenant to move in with the tenant selecting paint and carpet colors).

 Market Rent Trajectory 
 We are constantly evaluating our schedule of future lease expirations to mitigate occupancy risk while maximizing net effective rents. We proactively manage future lease expirations based on our view of estimated current and future market conditions and asking rents. The following table sets forth our future lease expirations, excluding triple net leases, and management's estimates of market asking rents. Taking rents are typically lower than asking rents and may vary from building to building. There can be no assurances that our estimates of market rents are accurate or that market rents currently prevailing will not erode or outperform in the future.

 Industry Segments 
 The Company is a REIT that is engaged in the acquisition, development, redevelopment, repositioning, ownership, management and operation of commercial properties, principally office properties, located in the New York metropolitan area, principally Manhattan, and has two reportable segments: real estate and debt and preferred equity investments. Our industry segments are discussed in Note 21, "Segment Information," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Table of Contents 

As of December 31, 2022, our real estate portfolio was principally located in one geographical market, Manhattan, a borough of New York City. The Company's primary sources of real estate revenue are tenant rents, escalations and reimbursement revenue. Real estate property operating expenses consist primarily of cleaning, security, maintenance, utility costs, real estate taxes and, at certain properties, ground rent expense. As of December 31, 2022, one tenant in our office portfolio, Paramount Global (formerly ViacomCBS Inc.), contributed 5.4 of our share of annualized cash rent. No other tenant contributed more than 5.0 of our share of annualized cash rent. No property contributed in excess of 10.0 of our consolidated total revenue for 2022. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we held debt and preferred equity investments with a book value of 623.3 million, excluding debt and preferred equity investments and other financing receivables totaling 8.5 million that are included in balance sheet line items other than the Debt and preferred equity investments line item. As of December 31, 2022, the assets underlying our debt and preferred equity investments were located in New York City. The primary sources of debt and preferred equity revenue are interest and fee income. 
 
 Human Capital 
 Our employees are our most important asset. As we navigated through the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented new employee programs and physical office space enhancements to keep employees healthy, safe, and focused. Through the commitment of our employees, we have remained fully operational for all tenants, including the essential businesses that fill our buildings, and we were among the first employers in New York City to return 100 of our employees to the office in June 2020. 
 We are focused on fostering an inclusive workforce that attracts and retains highly talented and diverse individuals. We are dedicated to creating a diverse workplace where employees feel valued and accepted regardless of race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, or veteran status. We have a dual-track performance management program, which includes both ongoing goal setting and annual performance reviews for all employees. Communication, teamwork, and collaboration are the fundamental attributes that are the foundation of our company culture. We promote the professional development of our employees by offering opportunities to participate in trainings and continuing education programs. We also offer a leading benefits package that includes extensive medical coverage, mental health and wellness services, paternal benefits, and financial resources. 
 Our compensation program is designed to incentivize employees by offering competitive compensation comprised of fixed and variable pay including base salaries and cash bonuses. Many of our employees also receive equity awards that are subject to vesting over a multi-year period based on continued service. We believe these equity awards serve as an additional retention tool for our employees. By cultivating a work culture that prioritizes our people through training, diversity, education, and volunteerism, we have been able to retain a long-tenured staff with 44 of current employees having a tenure of five years or more and a management team that has an average tenure of 20.3 years. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we employed 1,137 employees, 303 of whom were employed in our corporate offices. There are currently five collective bargaining agreements which cover the union workforce that services substantially all of our properties. 
 
 Climate Change 
 Our assessment of climate-related issues includes physical risks, transitions risks, and associated opportunities. We believe our sustained focus on Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") issues has led to effective risk-management practices that influence strategic decisions. 
 The Company takes a proactive approach to climate-related risk management throughout the organization. ESG considerations are embedded into our governance structure and management responsibilities, driving our climate-related risk assessment processes and enabling comprehensive risk mitigation responses to be implemented in all relevant business segments across short-term (0-1 year), medium-term (1-15 years), and long-term (15-40 years) time horizons. 
 With our roots in New York City, we are at the center of one of the world's most ambitious climate legislative environments. Through the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act signed into law in 2019, New York State mandated the adoption of a net-zero carbon economy statewide by 2050, with a zero-carbon electricity grid by 2040. New York City enacted Local Law 97 (LL97) in 2019 under the Climate Mobilization Act, setting carbon caps for large buildings starting in 2024 as part of a broader commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 by 2030, and by 80 by 2050. We do not anticipate any material financial impact on our portfolio in the first compliance period of 2024 to 2029.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Declines in the demand for office space in the New York metropolitan area, and in particular midtown Manhattan, could adversely affect the value of our real estate portfolio and our results of operations and, consequently, our ability to service current debt and to pay dividends and distributions to security holders. 
 A significant majority of our property holdings are comprised of commercial office properties located in midtown Manhattan. Our property holdings also include some retail properties. As a result of the concentration of our holdings, our business is dependent on the condition of the New York metropolitan area economy in general and the market for office space in midtown Manhattan in particular. Future weakness and uncertainty in the New York metropolitan area economy could materially reduce the value of our real estate portfolio and our rental revenues, and thus adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our debt obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to security holders. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic caused severe disruptions with wide ranging impacts to virtually every segment of society and the global economy. Office companies in particular have been affected by the increased acceptance of flexible or hybrid work schedules, allowing employees to work remotely and collaborate through video or teleconferencing instead of in-office attendance. The continuation or further increase to remote work policies and flexible work arrangements may cause office tenants to reassess their long-term physical needs, which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity, cash flows, prospects, and our ability to achieve forward-looking targets and expectations. 
 We may be unable to renew leases or relet space as leases expire. 
 If tenants decide not to renew their leases upon expiration, we may not be able to relet the space. Even if tenants do renew or we can relet the space, the terms of a renewal or new lease, taking into account among other things, the cost of improvements to the property and leasing commissions, may be less favorable than the terms in the expired leases. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 40.8 of the rentable square feet at our consolidated properties and approximately 23.5 of the rentable square feet at our unconsolidated joint venture properties are scheduled to expire by December 31, 2027. As of December 31, 2022, these leases had annualized escalated rent totaling 305.2 million and 438.1 million, respectively. In addition, changes in space utilization by tenants may cause us to incur substantial costs in renovating or redesigning the internal configuration of the relevant property in order to renew or relet space. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the space at similar rates or if we incur substantial costs in renewing or reletting the space, our cash flow and ability to service our debt obligations and pay dividends and distributions to security holders could be adversely affected. 
 We face significant competition for tenants. 
 The leasing of real estate is highly competitive. The principal competitive factors are rent, location, lease term, lease concessions, services provided and the nature and condition of the property to be leased. We directly compete with all owners, developers and operators of similar space in the areas in which our properties are located. 
 Our commercial office properties are concentrated in highly developed areas of the New York metropolitan area. Manhattan is the largest office market in the United States. The number of competitive office properties in the New York metropolitan area, which may be newer or better located than our properties, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease office space at our properties, and on the effective rents we are able to charge. 
 The expiration of long term leases or operating sublease interests where we do not own a fee interest in the land could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Our interests in certain properties are entirely or partially comprised of either long-term leasehold or operating sublease interests in the land and the improvements, rather than by ownership of fee interest in the land. As of December 31, 2022, the expiration dates of these long-term leases range from 2043 to 2119, including the effect of our unilateral extension rights at each of these properties. Pursuant to the leasehold arrangements, we, as tenant under the long-term leasehold or the operating sublease, perform the functions traditionally performed by landlords with respect to our subtenants. We are responsible for not only collecting rent from our subtenants, but also maintaining the property and paying expenses relating to the property. Annualized cash rents, including our share of joint venture annualized cash rents, from properties held through long-term leases or operating sublease interests as of December 31, 2022 totaled 258.2 million, or 18.3 , of our share of total Portfolio annualized cash rent. Unless we purchase a fee interest in the underlying land or extend the terms of these leases prior to expiration, we will no longer operate these properties upon expiration of the leases, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Rent payments under leasehold or operating sublease interests are adjusted, within the parameters of the contractual arrangements, at certain intervals. Rent adjustments may result in higher rents that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.

We rely on five large properties for a significant portion of our revenue. 
 Five of our properties, One Vanderbilt Avenue, 245 Park Avenue, 11 Madison Avenue, 420 Lexington Avenue, and 1515 Broadway accounted for 40.0 of our Portfolio annualized cash rent, which includes our share of joint venture annualized cash rent, as of December 31, 2022. 
 Our revenue and cash available to service debt obligations and for distribution to our stockholders would be materially adversely affected if any of these properties were materially damaged or destroyed. Additionally, our revenue and cash available to service debt obligations and for distribution to our stockholders would be materially adversely affected if tenants at these properties fail to timely make rental payments due to adverse financial conditions or otherwise, default under their leases or file for bankruptcy or become insolvent. 
 Our results of operations rely on major tenants and insolvency or bankruptcy of these or other tenants could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Giving effect to leases in effect as of December 31, 2022 for consolidated properties and unconsolidated joint venture properties, as of that date, our five largest tenants, based on annualized cash rent, accounted for 14.1 of our share of Portfolio annualized cash rent, with one tenant, Paramount Global (formerly ViacomCBS Inc.), accounting for 5.4 of our share of Portfolio annualized cash rent. Our business and results of operations would be adversely affected if any of our major tenants became insolvent, declared bankruptcy, or otherwise refused to pay rent in a timely fashion or at all. In addition, if business conditions in the industries in which our tenants are concentrated deteriorate, or economic volatility has a disproportionate impact on our tenants, we may experience increases in past due accounts, defaults, lower occupancy and reduced effective rents across tenants in such industries, which could in turn have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 Construction is in progress at our development projects. 
 The Company's development projects are subject to internal and external factors which may affect construction progress. Unforeseen matters could delay completion, result in increased costs or otherwise have a material effect on our results of operations. In addition, the extended time frame to complete these projects could cause them to be subject to shifts and trends in the real estate market which may not be consistent with our current business plans for the properties. 
 We are subject to risks that affect the retail environment. 
 While only 3.5 of our Portfolio annualized cash rent is generated by retail properties, principally in Manhattan, we are subject to risks that affect the retail environment generally, including the level of consumer spending and preferences, consumer confidence, electronic retail competition, levels of tourism in Manhattan, and governmental measures aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19. These factors could adversely affect the financial condition of our retail tenants and the willingness of retailers to lease space in our retail properties, which could in turn have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 We are subject to the risk of adverse changes in economic and geopolitical conditions in general and the commercial office markets in particular. 
 Our business has been affected by the ongoing volatility in the U.S. financial and credit markets and other market, economic, or political challenges experienced by the U.S. economy or the real estate industry as a whole, including changes in law and policy and uncertainty in connection with any such changes. Periods of economic weakness or volatility result in reduced access to credit and/or wider credit spreads. Economic or political uncertainty, including concern about growth and the stability of the markets generally and changes in interest rates, have led lenders and institutional investors to reduce and, in some cases, cease to provide funding to borrowers, which adversely affects our liquidity and financial condition, and the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants. Specifically, our business, like other real estate businesses, is affected by the following conditions: 
 significant job losses or declining rates of job creation, which decrease demand for office space, causing market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted; 
 the ability to borrow on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, which reduces our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt, reducing our returns from both our existing operations and our acquisition and development activities and increasing our future interest expense; and 
 reduced values of our properties, which limits our ability to dispose of assets at acceptable prices and to obtain debt financing secured by our properties.

Leasing office space to smaller and growth-oriented businesses could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations. 
 Some of the tenants in our properties are smaller, growth-oriented businesses that may not have the financial strength of larger corporate tenants. Smaller companies generally experience a higher rate of failure than larger businesses. Growth-oriented firms may also seek other office space as they develop. Leasing office space to these companies creates a higher risk of tenant defaults, turnover and bankruptcies, which could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations. 
 We may suffer adverse consequences if our revenues decline since our operating costs do not decline in proportion to our revenue. 
 We earn a significant portion of our income from renting our properties. Our operating costs, however, do not fluctuate in proportion to changes in our rental revenue. If revenues decline more than expenses, we may be forced to borrow to cover our costs, we may incur losses or we may not have cash available to service our debt obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to security holders. 
 Competition for acquisitions may reduce the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and increase the costs of those acquisitions. 
 We may acquire properties when we are presented with attractive opportunities. We may face competition for acquisition opportunities from other investors, particularly those investors who are willing to incur more leverage, and this competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the following risks: 
 an inability to acquire a desired property because of competition from other well-capitalized real estate investors, including publicly traded and privately held REITs, private real estate funds, domestic and foreign financial institutions, life insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, pension trusts, partnerships and individual investors; and 
 an increase in the purchase price for such acquisition property. 
 If we are unable to successfully acquire additional properties, our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected. 
 We face risks associated with property acquisitions. 
 Our acquisition activities may not be successful if we are unable to meet required closing conditions or unable to finance acquisitions and developments of properties on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, we have less visibility into the future performance of acquired properties than properties that we have owned for a period of time, and therefore, recently acquired properties may not be as profitable as our existing portfolio. 
 Further, we may acquire properties subject to both known and unknown liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse to the seller. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us arising from our ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to properties acquired might include: 
 claims by tenants, vendors or other persons arising from dealing with the former owners of the properties; 
 liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; 
 claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties; and 
 liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination. 
 Limitations on our ability to sell or reduce the indebtedness on specific properties could adversely affect the value of our common stock. 
 In connection with past and future acquisitions of interests in properties, we have or may agree to restrictions on our ability to sell or refinance the acquired properties for certain periods. These limitations could result in us holding properties which we would otherwise sell, or prevent us from paying down or refinancing existing indebtedness, any of which may have adverse consequences on our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Potential losses may not be covered by insurance. 
 We maintain all-risk property and rental value coverage (including coverage regarding the perils of flood, earthquake and terrorism, excluding nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological terrorism ("NBCR")) within two property insurance programs and liability insurance. Separate property and liability coverage may be purchased on a stand-alone basis for certain assets, such as development projects. Additionally, one of our captive insurance companies, Belmont Insurance Company, or Belmont, provides coverage for NBCR terrorist acts above a specified trigger. Belmont's retention is reinsured by our other captive insurance company, Ticonderoga Insurance Company ("Ticonderoga"). If Belmont or Ticonderoga are required to pay a claim under our insurance policies, we would ultimately record the loss to the extent of required payments. There is no assurance that in the future we will be able to procure coverage at a reasonable cost. Further, if we experience losses that are uninsured or that exceed policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties. Additionally, our debt instruments contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance and we could default under our debt instruments if the cost and/or availability of certain types of insurance make it impractical or impossible to comply with such covenants relating to insurance. Belmont and Ticonderoga provide coverage solely on properties owned, in whole or in part, by the Company or its affiliates. 
 Furthermore, with respect to certain of our properties, including certain properties held by joint ventures or subject to triple net leases, insurance coverage is obtained by a third-party and we do not control the coverage. While we may have agreements with such third parties to maintain adequate coverage and we monitor these policies, such coverage ultimately may not be maintained or adequately cover our risk of loss. 
 The occurrence of a terrorist attack may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to generate cash flow. 
 Our operations are primarily concentrated in the New York metropolitan area. In the aftermath of a terrorist attack or other acts of terrorism or war, tenants in the New York metropolitan area may choose to relocate their business to less populated, lower-profile areas of the United States that those tenants believe are not as likely to be targets of future terrorist activity. In addition, economic activity could decline as a result of terrorist attacks or other acts of terrorism or war, or the perceived threat of such acts. Each of these impacts could in turn trigger a decrease in the demand for space in the New York metropolitan area, which could increase vacancies in our properties and force us to lease our properties on less favorable terms. While under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019, insurers must make terrorism insurance available under their property and casualty insurance policies, this legislation does not regulate the pricing of such insurance. The absence of affordable terrorism insurance coverage may adversely affect the general real estate lending market, lending volume and the market's overall liquidity and, in the event of an uninsured loss, we could lose all or a portion of our assets. Furthermore, we may also experience increased costs in relation to security equipment and personnel. As a result, the value of our properties and our results of operations could materially decline. 
 We face possible risks associated with the natural disasters and the effects of climate change. 
 We are subject to risks associated with natural disasters and the effects of climate change, which can include storms, hurricanes and flooding, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations and business. To the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns, our markets could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea-levels. Over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for office space in our buildings or our inability to operate the buildings at all. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable, increasing the cost of energy at our properties and requiring us to expend funds as we seek to repair and protect our properties against such risks. Any of these direct or indirect effects of climate change may have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations or business. 
 We may incur significant costs to comply with climate change initiatives, and in particular those implemented in New York City. 
 Numerous states and municipalities have adopted laws and policies on climate change and emission reduction targets. In particular, through the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act signed into law in 2019, New York State mandated the adoption of a net-zero carbon economy statewide by 2050, with a zero-carbon electricity grid by 2040. New York City enacted Local Law 97 (LL97) in 2019 under the Climate Mobilization Act, setting carbon caps for large buildings starting in 2024 as part of a broader commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 by 2030, and by 80 by 2050. As our portfolio is principally located in Manhattan, our business is subject to transition risks related to these climate change policies. If we are unable to meet the required emissions reductions, we may be subject to material fines that will continue to be assessed each year we fail to comply. Additionally, even if we can achieve compliance under LL97 in a given year, it is not a certainty that we will remain in compliance in subsequent years. And, costs of compliance or penalties may be significant.

We face potential conflicts of interest. 
 There are potential conflicts of interest between us and Stephen L. Green. 
 There is a potential conflict of interest relating to the disposition of certain property contributed to us by Stephen L. Green and affiliated entities in our initial public offering. Mr. Green serves as a member and as the chairman emeritus of our Board of Directors. If we sell a property in a transaction in which a taxable gain is recognized, for tax purposes the built-in gain would be allocated solely to him and not to us. As a result, Mr. Green has a conflict of interest if the sale of a property he contributed is in our best interest but not his. 
 In addition, Mr. Green's tax basis includes his share of debt, including mortgage indebtedness, owed by the Operating Partnership. If the Operating Partnership were to retire such debt, then he would experience a decrease in his share of liabilities, which, for tax purposes, would be treated as a distribution of cash to him. To the extent the deemed distribution of cash exceeded his tax basis, he would recognize gain. As a result, Mr. Green has a conflict of interest if the refinancing of indebtedness is in our best interest but not his. 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Debt financing, financial covenants, degree of leverage, and increases in interest rates could adversely affect our economic performance. 
 Scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Cash flow could be insufficient to meet the payments of principal and interest required under our current mortgages, our 2021 credit facility, 2022 term loan, our senior unsecured notes, our debentures and indebtedness outstanding at our joint venture properties. The total principal amount of our outstanding consolidated indebtedness was 5.6 billion as of December 31, 2022, consisting of 1.7 billion in unsecured bank term loans, 0.1 billion under our senior unsecured notes, 0.1 billion of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures, 3.2 billion of non-recourse mortgages and loans payable on certain of our properties and debt and preferred equity investments, 450.0 million drawn under our revolving credit facility, and 2.0 million of outstanding letters of credit. In addition, we could increase the amount of our outstanding consolidated indebtedness in the future, in part by borrowing under the revolving credit facility portion of our 2021 credit facility. As of December 31, 2022, the total principal amount of non-recourse indebtedness outstanding at the joint venture properties was 12.5 billion, of which our proportionate share was 6.2 billion. As of December 31, 2022, we had no recourse indebtedness outstanding at our unconsolidated joint venture properties. 
 If we are unable to make payments under our 2021 credit facility and 2022 term loan, all amounts due and owing at such time shall accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to 2 higher than the rate applicable immediately prior to the default. If we are unable to make payments under our senior unsecured notes, the principal and unpaid interest will become immediately payable. If a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, the mortgagee could foreclose on the property, resulting in loss of income and asset value. Foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to make payments under our 2021 credit facility, 2022 term loan or our senior unsecured notes could trigger defaults under the terms of our other financings, making such financings at risk of being declared immediately payable, and would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We may not be able to refinance existing indebtedness, which may require substantial principal payments at maturity. 260.1 million of consolidated mortgage debt and 1.1 billion of unconsolidated joint venture debt is scheduled to mature in 2023 after giving effect to our as-of-right extension options and repayments and refinancing of consolidated and joint venture debt between December 31, 2022 and February 15, 2023 as discussed in the "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" section. At the present time, we intend to repay, refinance, or exercise extension options on the debt associated with our properties on or prior to their respective maturity dates. At the time of refinancing, prevailing interest rates or other factors, such as the possible reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans, may result in higher interest rates. Increased interest expense on the extended or refinanced debt would adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service debt obligations and pay dividends and distributions to security holders. If any principal payments due at maturity cannot be repaid, refinanced or extended, our cash flow will not be sufficient to repay maturing or accelerated debt. 
 Financial covenants could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. 
 The mortgages and mezzanine loans on our properties generally contain customary negative covenants that limit our ability to further mortgage the properties, to enter into material leases without lender consent or materially modify existing leases, among other things. In addition, our 2021 credit facility, 2022 term loan and senior unsecured notes contain restrictions and requirements on our method of operations. Our 2021 credit facility and our unsecured notes also require us to maintain designated ratios, including but not limited to, total debt-to-assets, debt service coverage and unencumbered assets-to-unsecured debt. These restrictions could adversely affect operations (including reducing our flexibility and our ability to incur additional debt), our ability to pay debt obligations and our ability to pay dividends and distributions to security holders.

Rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow. 
 Advances under our 2021 credit facility, 2022 term loan and certain property-level mortgage debt bear interest at a variable rate. After giving effect to derivatives, our consolidated variable rate borrowings totaled 0.5 billion as of December 31, 2022. In addition, we could increase the amount of our outstanding variable rate debt in the future, in part by borrowing additional amounts under our 2021 credit facility. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility and three term loans bore interest at the adjusted term SOFR plus 10 basis points, and the applicable spreads of 105 basis points, 120 basis points, 125 basis points, and 140 basis points, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, borrowings under our term loans and junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures totaled 1.7 billion and 100.0 million, respectively. We may incur indebtedness in the future that also bears interest at a variable rate or may be required to refinance our debt at higher rates. If we were to incur variable rate indebtedness in the future, we may seek to enter into derivative instruments to mitigate the effect of such variable rate debt. However, such derivative instruments may not be available on favorable terms or at all. As of December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across each of our variable interest rate instruments, including our variable rate debt and preferred equity investments which mitigate our exposure to interest rate changes, would increase our net annual interest costs by 3.5 million and would increase our share of joint venture annual interest costs by 6.5 million. Our joint ventures may also incur variable rate debt and face similar risks. Accordingly, increases in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions and our ability to continue to pay dividends and distributions to security holders. 
 The planned phasing out of LIBOR may affect our financial results. 
 In March 2021, ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, with the support of the Federal Reserve Board and the FCA, announced plans to extend the publication of certain USD LIBOR settings until June 30, 2023 after which LIBOR reference rates will cease to be provided. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes or the establishment of alternative reference rates. 
 The Alternative Reference Rate Committee ("ARRC"), a committee convened by the Federal Reserve that includes major market participants, and on which the SEC staff and other regulators participate, has proposed an alternative rate, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), to replace U.S. Dollar LIBOR. Any changes announced by the FCA, ARRC, other regulators or any other successor governance or oversight body, or future changes adopted by such body, in the method pursuant to which U.S. Dollar LIBOR, SOFR, or any other alternative rates are determined may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in the reported LIBOR rates. If that were to occur, the levels of interest payments we incur and interest payments we receive may change. It is also uncertain whether SOFR or any other alternative rate will gain market acceptance and may result in, among other things, volatility or illiquidity in markets for instruments that currently rely on LIBOR. In addition, although certain of our LIBOR based obligations and investments provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate if LIBOR is not reported, uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher than, lower than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the interest rates and/or payments that would have been made on our obligations if LIBOR rate was available in its current form. We may also need to renegotiate our LIBOR based obligations, which we may not be successful in doing on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us. 
 Borrowings under our existing term loan and revolving credit facilities bear interest at a rate based on the term SOFR, which is a relatively new reference rate. The publication of SOFR began in April 2019, and, therefore, it has a very limited history. The future performance of SOFR cannot be predicted based on the limited historical performance. Since the initial publication of SOFR, changes in SOFR have, on occasion, been more volatile than changes in other benchmark or market rates, such as US dollar LIBOR. As a result, the amount of interest we may pay on our credit facilities is difficult to predict. 
 Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect results of operations. 
 The interest rate hedge instruments we use to manage some of our exposure to interest rate volatility involve risk and counterparties may fail to perform under these arrangements. In addition, these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes. When existing interest rate hedges terminate, we may incur increased costs in putting in place further interest rate hedges. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Increases in our leverage could adversely affect our stock price. 
 Our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness we may incur. We consider many factors when making decisions regarding the incurrence of indebtedness, such as the purchase price of properties to be acquired with debt financing, the estimated market value of our properties and the ability of particular properties and our business as a whole to generate cash flow to cover expected debt service. Any changes that increase our leverage could be viewed negatively by investors and could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, the trading price of our securities and our ability to pay dividends and distributions to security holders.

A downgrade in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition. 
 Our credit rating and the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities and our preferred stock could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and any rating could be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant such action. If any of the credit rating agencies that have rated our securities downgrades or lowers its credit rating, or if any credit rating agency indicates that it has placed any such rating on a watch list for a possible downgrading or lowering, or otherwise indicates that its outlook for that rating is negative, such action could have a material adverse effect on our costs and availability of funding, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, the trading price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to security holders. 
 Debt and preferred equity investments could cause us to incur expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 We held first mortgages, mezzanine loans, junior participations and preferred equity interests with an aggregate net book value of 623.3 million as of December 31, 2022. Some of these instruments may have some recourse to their sponsors, while others are limited to the collateral securing the loan. In the event of a default under these obligations, we may have to take possession of the collateral securing these interests. Borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies, seek bankruptcy protection against such enforcement and/or bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce their obligations to us. Declines in the value of the property may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our investment upon foreclosure or realization even if we make substantial improvements or repairs to the underlying real estate in order to maximize such property's investment potential. In addition, we may invest in mortgage-backed securities and other marketable securities. 
 Our debt and preferred equity investments are carried at the net amounts expected to be collected. We maintain and regularly evaluate the need for reserves to protect against potential future credit losses. Our reserves reflect management's judgment of the probability and severity of losses and the value of the underlying collateral. We cannot be certain that our judgment will prove to be correct and that our reserves will be adequate over time to protect against future credit losses because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or events adversely affecting specific properties, assets, tenants, borrowers, industries in which our tenants and borrowers operate or markets in which our tenants and borrowers or their properties are located. The ultimate resolutions may differ from our expectation, and we could suffer losses which would have a material adverse effect on our financial performance, the trading price of our securities and our ability to pay dividends and distributions to security holders. 
 Joint investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority and reliance upon a co-venturer's financial condition. 
 We co-invest with third parties through partnerships, joint ventures, co-tenancies or other structures, and by acquiring non-controlling interests in, or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of, a property, partnership, joint venture, co-tenancy or other entity. Therefore, we may not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding such property, partnership, joint venture or other entity. Investments in partnerships, joint ventures, or other entities may involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that our partners, co-tenants or co-venturers might file for bankruptcy protection or otherwise fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Additionally, our partners or co-venturers might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals which are competitive or inconsistent with our business interests or goals. These investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale, because neither we, nor the partner, co-tenant or co-venturer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture. In addition, we may in specific circumstances be liable for the actions of our third-party partners, co-tenants or co-venturers. As of December 31, 2022, we had an aggregate cost basis in joint ventures totaling 3.2 billion. 
 Certain of our joint venture agreements contain terms in favor of our partners that could have an adverse effect on the value of our investments in the joint ventures. 
 Each of our joint venture agreements has been individually negotiated with our partner in the joint venture and, in some cases, we have agreed to terms that are more favorable to our partner in the joint venture than to us. For example, our partner may be entitled to a specified portion of the profits of the joint venture before we are entitled to any portion of such profits. We may also enter into similar arrangements in the future.

We are dependent on external sources of capital. 
 We need a substantial amount of capital to operate and grow our business. This need is exacerbated by the distribution requirements imposed on us for SL Green to qualify as a REIT. We therefore rely on third-party sources of capital, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends on a number of things, including the market's perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings. In addition, we may raise money in the public equity and debt markets and our ability to do so will depend upon the general conditions prevailing in these markets. At any time, conditions may exist which effectively prevent us, or REITs in general, from accessing these markets. Moreover, additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of our stockholders' interests, and additional debt financing may substantially increase our leverage. 
 RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE 
 We depend on dividends and distributions from our direct and indirect subsidiaries. 
 Substantially all of our assets are held through subsidiaries of our Operating Partnership. We are, therefore, dependent on the results of operations of our subsidiaries and their ability to provide us with cash, whether in the form of dividends paid through our Operating Partnership, loans or otherwise, to meet our obligations and to pay any dividends to our equity holders. Any distributions to us from those subsidiaries may be subject to contractual and other restrictions, including such subsidiaries' obligations to their creditors, and could be subject to other business and operational considerations. Additionally, our Operating Partnership's ability to distribute to us any cash that it receives from our subsidiaries will also depend on its ability to first satisfy its obligations to its creditors and make distributions payable to holders of its outstanding preferred units and any additional preferred units it may issue from time to time. 
 In addition, our participation in any distribution of the assets of any of our direct or indirect subsidiaries upon any liquidation, reorganization or insolvency is only after the claims of the creditors, including trade creditors and preferred security holders, are satisfied. 
 Our charter documents, debt instruments and applicable law may hinder any attempt to acquire us, which could discourage takeover attempts and prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium over the market price of our stock. 
 Provisions of our charter and bylaws could inhibit changes in control. 
 A change of control of our company could benefit stockholders by providing them with a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our stock. However, provisions contained in our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions, discussed more fully below, are: 
 Ownership limitations; 
 Maryland takeover statutes that may prevent a change of control of our company; and 
 Contractual provisions that limit the assumption of certain of our debt. 
 We have a stock ownership limit. 
 To remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any taxable year. For this purpose, stock may be "owned" directly, as well as indirectly under certain constructive ownership rules, including, for example, rules that attribute stock held by one shareholder to another shareholder. In part to avoid violating this rule regarding stock ownership limitations and maintain our REIT qualification, our charter prohibits direct or indirect ownership by any single stockholder of more than 9.0 in value or number of shares of our common stock. Limitations on the ownership of preferred stock may also be imposed by us. 
 Our board of directors has the discretion to raise or waive this limitation on ownership for any stockholder if deemed to be in our best interest. Our board of directors has granted such waivers from time to time. To obtain a waiver, a stockholder must present the board and our tax counsel with evidence that ownership in excess of this limit will not affect our present or future REIT status. 
 Absent any exemption or waiver, stock acquired or held in excess of the limit on ownership will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary, and the stockholder's rights to distributions and to vote would terminate. The stockholder would be entitled to receive, from the proceeds of any subsequent sale of the shares transferred to the charitable trust, the lesser of: the price paid for the stock or, if the owner did not pay for the stock, the market price of the stock on the date of the event causing the stock to be transferred to the charitable trust; and the amount realized from the sale. 
 This limitation on ownership of stock could delay or prevent a change in control of our company.

Maryland takeover statutes may prevent a change of control of our company, which could depress our stock price. 
 Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, or the MGCL, "business combinations" between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities. An interested stockholder is defined as: 
 any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding voting stock; or 
 an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10 or more of the voting power of the then outstanding voting stock of the corporation. 
 A person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if the board of directors approves in advance the transaction by which he otherwise would have become an interested stockholder. 
 After the five year prohibition, any business combination between the Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by the board of directors of the corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least: 
 80 of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation, voting together as a single group; and 
 two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom or with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder. 
 The business combination statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer, including potential acquisitions that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. 
 In addition, the MGCL provides that holders of "control shares" of a Maryland corporation acquired in a "control share acquisition" will not have voting rights with respect to the control shares except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding shares of stock owned by the acquiror, by officers of the corporation or by directors who are employees of the corporation. "Control shares" means voting shares of stock that, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned by the acquiror or in respect of which the acquiror is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquiror to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of voting power: (i) one-tenth or more but less than one-third; (ii) one-third or more but less than a majority; or (iii) a majority or more of all voting power. A "control share acquisition" means the acquisition of ownership of, or the power to direct the exercise of voting power with respect to, issued and outstanding control shares, subject to certain exceptions. 
 We have opted out of the "business combinations" and "control shares" provisions of the MGCL by resolution of our board of directors and a provision in our bylaws, respectively. However, in the future, our board of directors may reverse its decision by resolution and elect to opt in to the MGCL's business combination provisions, or amend our bylaws and elect to opt in to the MGCL's control share provisions. 
 Additionally, other provisions of the MGCL permit our board of directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain other takeover defenses, some of which have been implemented through provisions in our charter or bylaws unrelated to the provisions of the MGCL. Such takeover defenses, to the extent implemented now or in the future, may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making us an acquisition proposal or of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in our control under circumstances that otherwise could provide our stockholders with an opportunity to realize a premium over the then-current market price. 
 Contractual provisions that limit the assumption of certain of our debt may prevent a change in control. 
 Certain of our consolidated debt is not assumable and may be subject to significant prepayment penalties. These limitations could deter a change in control of our company.

SL Green's failure to qualify as a REIT would be costly and would have a significant effect on the value of our securities. 
 We believe we have operated in a manner for SL Green to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and intend to continue to so operate. Many of the REIT compliance requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. The determination that SL Green is a REIT requires an analysis of factual matters and circumstances. These matters, some of which are not totally within our control, can affect SL Green's qualification as a REIT. For example, to qualify as a REIT, at least 95 of our gross income must come from designated sources that are listed in the applicable tax laws. We are also required to distribute to stockholders at least 90 of our REIT taxable income excluding capital gains. The fact that we hold our assets through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the REIT requirements. Even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our REIT status. Furthermore, Congress and the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, might make changes to the tax laws and regulations that make it more difficult, or impossible, for us to remain qualified as a REIT. 
 If SL Green fails to qualify as a REIT, the funds available for distribution to our stockholders would be substantially reduced as we would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to our stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates and possibly increased state and local taxes. 
 Also, unless the IRS grants us relief under specific statutory provisions, SL Green would remain disqualified as a REIT for four years following the year in which SL Green first failed to qualify. If SL Green failed to qualify as a REIT, SL Green would have to pay significant income taxes and would therefore have less money available for investments, to service debt obligations or to pay dividends and distributions to security holders. This would have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities. In addition, the REIT tax laws would no longer obligate us to make any distributions to stockholders. As a result of all these factors, if SL Green fails to qualify as a REIT, this could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital. 
 We may in the future pay taxable dividends on our common stock in common stock and cash. 
 In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, excluding net capital gains. In order to avoid taxation of our income, we are required to annually distribute to our stockholders all of our taxable income, including net capital gains. In order to satisfy these requirements, we have, and in the future may make distributions that are payable partly in cash and partly in shares of our common stock. If we pay such a dividend, taxable stockholders would be required to include the entire amount of the dividend, including the portion paid with shares of common stock, as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, and may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends received. 
 RISKS RELATED TO LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS 
 We may incur costs to comply with governmental laws and regulations. 
 We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws that can impose liability on current and former property owners or operators for the clean-up of certain hazardous substances released on a property or of contamination at any facility (e.g., a landfill) to which we have sent hazardous substances for treatment or disposal, without regard to fault or whether the release or disposal was in compliance with law. Being held responsible for such a clean-up could result in significant cost to us and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our properties may be subject to risks relating to current or future laws, including laws benefiting disabled persons, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, and state or local zoning, construction or other regulations. Compliance with such laws may require significant property modifications in the future, which could be costly. Non-compliance could result in fines being levied against us in the future. 
 Compliance with changing or new regulations applicable to corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses, or affect our operations. 
 Changing or new laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including SEC regulations and NYSE rules, can create uncertainty for public companies. These changed or new laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity. As a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, our reputation may be harmed. 
 22 

Table of Contents 

Our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. In particular, our continued efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors' audit of that assessment have required the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. We expect these efforts to require the continued commitment of significant resources. Further, our directors, chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties. As a result, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified directors and executive officers, which could harm our business. 
 Our property taxes could increase due to reassessment or property tax rate changes. 
 We are required to pay real property taxes or payments in lieu of taxes in respect of our properties and such taxes may increase as our properties are reassessed by taxing authorities or as property tax rates change. An increase in the assessed value of our properties or our property tax rates could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders. 
 GENERAL RISK FACTORS 
 The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. 
 Between January 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022, the closing sale price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, ranged from 32.94 to 83.95 per share. Our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as those described elsewhere in this "Risk Factors" section. Equity issuances or buybacks by us or the perception that such issuances or buybacks may occur may also affect the market price of our common stock. 
 Future issuances of common stock, preferred stock and convertible debt could dilute existing stockholders' interests. 
 Our charter authorizes our Board of Directors to issue additional shares of common stock, preferred stock and convertible equity or debt without stockholder approval and without the requirement to offer rights of pre-emption to existing stockholders. Any such issuance could dilute our existing stockholders' interests. Also, any future series of preferred stock may have voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company. 
 Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
 As with other publicly traded equity securities, the value of our common stock depends on various market conditions, which may change from time to time. In addition to the current economic environment and future volatility in the securities and credit markets, the following market conditions may affect the value of our common stock: 
 the general reputation of REITs and the attractiveness of our equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate-based companies; 
 our financial performance; and 
 general stock and bond market conditions. 
 The market value of our common stock is based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the market's perception of the current and future value of our assets, our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends. Consequently, our common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than our net asset value per share of common stock. 
 Changes to U.S. federal income tax laws could materially and adversely affect us and our stockholders. 
 U.S. federal income tax laws and the rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are continually under review by Congress, the IRS, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our shares or on the market value or the resale potential of our assets. 
 Loss of our key personnel could harm our operations and our stock price. 
 We are dependent on the efforts of Marc Holliday, our chairman and chief executive officer, and Andrew W. Mathias, our president. These officers have employment agreements which expire in January 2025 and December 2023, respectively. A loss of the services of either of these individuals could adversely affect our operations and could be negatively perceived by the market resulting in a decrease in our stock price.

Our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures or cyber security attacks. 
 Despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to a number of risks including energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures and cyber attacks and intrusions, such as computer viruses, malware, attachments to e-mails, intrusion and unauthorized access, including from persons inside our organization or from persons outside our organization with access to our systems. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attacks and intrusions, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and instructions from around the world have increased. Our systems are critical to the operation of our business and any system failure, accident or security breach that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business. We may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems and have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Any compromise of our security could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the information (which may be confidential, proprietary and/or commercially sensitive in nature) and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business.

 Historical Occupancy 
 Historically, we have consistently achieved materially higher occupancy rates in our Manhattan portfolio as compared to the overall midtown Manhattan market, as shown over the last five years in the following table: 
 Occupancy Rate of Manhattan Operating Portfolio(1) Occupancy Rate of Class A Office Properties in the Midtown Manhattan Markets(2)(3) Occupancy Rate of Class B Office Properties in the Midtown Manhattan Markets(2)(3) December 31, 2022 90.7 78.4 76.6 December 31, 2021 92.1 80.6 77.1 December 31, 2020 92.4 85.0 81.1 December 31, 2019 94.5 88.8 87.4 December 31, 2018 94.5 91.1 89.4 
 (1) Includes our consolidated and unconsolidated Manhattan office properties. 
 (2) Includes vacant space available for direct lease and sublease. Source: Cushman Wakefield. 
 (3) The term "Class B" is generally used in the Manhattan office market to describe office properties that are more than 25 years old but that are in good physical condition, enjoy widespread acceptance by high-quality tenants and are situated in desirable locations in Manhattan. Class B office properties can be distinguished from Class A properties in that Class A properties are generally newer properties with higher finishes and frequently obtain the highest rental rates within their markets. 
 Lease Expirations 
 Leases in our Manhattan portfolio, as at many other Manhattan office properties, typically have an initial term of seven to fifteen years, compared to typical lease terms of five to ten years in other large U.S. office markets. For the five years ending December 31, 2027, the average annual lease expirations at our Manhattan consolidated and unconsolidated operating properties is expected to be approximately 0.8 million square feet and approximately 0.6 million square feet, respectively, representing an average annual expiration rate of approximately 8.3 and approximately 4.6 , respectively, per year (assuming no tenants exercise renewal or cancellation options and there are no tenant bankruptcies or other tenant defaults). 
 The following tables set forth a schedule of the annual lease expirations at our Manhattan consolidated and unconsolidated operating properties, respectively, with respect to leases in place as of December 31, 2022 for each of the next ten years and thereafter (assuming that no tenants exercise renewal or cancellation options and that there are no tenant bankruptcies or other tenant defaults):

 Environmental Matters 
 Phase I environmental site assessments have been prepared on the properties in our portfolio, in order to assess existing environmental conditions. All of the Phase I assessments met the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard. Under the ASTM Standard, a Phase I environmental site assessment consists of a site visit, an historical record review, a review of regulatory agency data bases and records, and interviews with on-site personnel, with the purpose of identifying potential environmental concerns associated with real estate. These environmental site assessments did not reveal any known environmental liability that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company and the Operating Partnership were not involved in any material litigation nor, to management's knowledge, was any material litigation threatened against us or our portfolio which if adversely determined could have a material adverse impact on us.

 ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS' COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
 SL GREEN REALTY CORP. 
 Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, under the symbol "SLG." On February 15, 2023, the reported closing sale price per share of common stock on the NYSE was 40.14 and there were 475 holders of record of our common stock. 
 SL GREEN OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, L.P. 
 As of December 31, 2022, there were 3,670,343 units of limited partnership interest of the Operating Partnership outstanding and held by persons other than the Company, which received distributions per unit of the same amount and in the same manner as dividends per share were distributed to common stockholders. 
 There is no established public trading market for the common units of the Operating Partnership. On February 15, 2023, there were 54 holders of record and 68,563,622 common units outstanding, 64,365,509 of which were held by SL Green. 
 In order for SL Green to maintain its qualification as a REIT, it must make annual distributions to its stockholders of at least 90 of its taxable income (not including net capital gains). SL Green has adopted a policy of paying regular dividends on its common stock, and the Operating Partnership has adopted a policy of paying regular distributions to its common units in the same amount as dividends paid by SL Green. Cash distributions have been paid on the common stock of SL Green and the common units of the Operating Partnership since the initial public offering of SL Green. Distributions are declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors of SL Green and depend on actual and anticipated cash from operations, financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and other factors SL Green s Board of Directors may consider relevant. 
 Each time SL Green issues shares of stock (other than in exchange for common units of limited partnership interest of the Operating Partnership, or OP Units, when such OP Units are presented for redemption), it contributes the proceeds of such issuance to the Operating Partnership in return for an equivalent number of units of limited partnership interest with rights and preferences analogous to the shares issued. 
 ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
 In August 2016, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program under which we could buy up to 1.0 billion of shares of our common stock. The Board of Directors has since authorized five separate 500.0 million increases to the size of the share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2017, second quarter of 2018, fourth quarter of 2018, fourth quarter of 2019, and fourth quarter of 2020 bringing the total program size to 3.5 billion. 
 As of December 31, 2022, share repurchases, excluding the redemption of OP Units, executed under the program were as follows:

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Overview 
 SL Green Realty Corp., which is referred to as SL Green or the Company, a Maryland corporation, and SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P., which is referred to as SLGOP or the Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, were formed in June 1997 for the purpose of combining the commercial real estate business of S.L. Green Properties, Inc. and its affiliated partnerships and entities. The Company is a self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, engaged in the acquisition, development, redevelopment, repositioning, ownership, management and operation of commercial real estate properties, principally office properties, located in the New York metropolitan area, principally Manhattan. Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to "we," "our" and "us" means the Company and all entities owned or controlled by the Company, including the Operating Partnership. 
 The following discussion related to our consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 is included in Part II, Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 18, 2022, and is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Leasing and Operating 
 As of December 31, 2022, our same-store Manhattan office property occupancy inclusive of leases signed but not commenced, was 91.2 compared to 93.0 as of December 31, 2021. We signed office leases in Manhattan encompassing approximately 2.1 million square feet, of which approximately 0.8 million square feet represented office leases that replaced previously occupied space. 
 According to Cushman Wakefield, leasing activity in Manhattan improved significantly in 2022 totaling approximately 24.3 million square feet. Of the total 2022 leasing activity in Manhattan, the Midtown submarket accounted for approximately 16.5 million square feet, or approximately 67.9 . Manhattan's overall office vacancy went from 20.4 as of December 31, 2021 to 22.2 as of December 31, 2022. Overall average asking rents in Manhattan increased in 2022 by 2.8 from 69.67 per square foot as of December 31, 2021 to 71.62 per square foot as of December 31, 2022, while Manhattan Class A asking rents increased to 78.72 per square foot, up 3.2 from 76.29 as of December 31, 2021. 
 Acquisition and Disposition Activity 
 Overall Manhattan sales volume increased by 10.2 in 2022 to 23.0 billion as compared to 20.9 billion in 2021. In 2022, we continued to dispose of properties that were considered non-core or had a more limited growth trajectory, raising efficiently priced capital that was used primarily for debt reduction. During the year, we closed on the sales of all or a portion of our interests in 707 Eleventh Avenue, 1080 Amsterdam Avenue, the Stonehenge Portfolio, 1591-1597 Broadway, 609 Fifth Avenue and 885 Third Avenue - Office Condominium Units for total gross valuations of 660.6 million, generating net proceeds to the Company of 582.5 million. 
 Debt and Preferred Equity 
 In 2021 and 2022, in our debt and preferred equity portfolio we continued to focus on underwriting financings for owners, acquirers or developers of properties in New York City. At the same time, we selectively sold certain investments, some investments were repaid, and we converted some investments into equity ownership, the proceeds of which were utilized to repurchase shares of common stock or for debt repayment. Our investment strategy provides us with the opportunity to fill a need for additional debt financing, while achieving attractive risk adjusted returns to us on the investments and receiving a significant amount of additional information on the New York City real estate market. During 2022, our debt and preferred equity activities included funding of 100.5 million, inclusive of advances under future funding obligations, discount and fee amortization, and paid-in-kind interest, net of premium amortization, and 565.9 million of sales, redemptions and participations.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 
 Investment in Commercial Real Estate Properties 
 Real estate properties are presented at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Costs directly related to the development or redevelopment of properties are capitalized. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred; major investments, which improve or extend the life of the asset, are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. 
 We recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed (including contingencies) and any noncontrolling interests in an acquired entity by allocating the purchase price, including transaction costs, at their respective fair values on the acquisition date. 
 We allocate the purchase price of real estate to land and building (inclusive of tenant improvements) and, if determined to be material, intangibles, such as the value of above- and below-market leases and origination costs associated with the in-place leases. 
 The allocation of the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves subjectivity as the allocations are based on an analysis of the respective fair values. In determining the fair value of the real estate acquired, the Company will use a third-party valuation which primarily utilizes cash flow projections that apply, among other things, estimated revenue and expense growth rates, discount rates and capitalization rates, as well as sales comparison approach, which utilizes comparable sales, listings and sales contracts. We assess fair value of the acquired leases based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property. The determined and allocated fair values to the real estate acquired will affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the respective estimated useful lives or term of the lease. 
 The Company classifies those leases under which the Company is the lessee at lease commencement as finance or operating leases. Leases qualify as finance leases if i) the lease transfers ownership of the asset at the end of the lease term, ii) the lease grants an option to purchase the asset that we are reasonably certain to exercise, iii) the lease term is for a major part of the remaining economic life of the asset, or iv) the present value of the lease payments exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset. Leases that do not qualify as finance leases are deemed to be operating leases. On the consolidated statements of operations, operating leases are expensed through operating lease rent while financing leases are expensed through amortization and interest expense. 
 We incur a variety of costs in the development and leasing of our properties. After the determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. The costs of land and building under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include, but are not limited to, pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year after major construction activity ceases. We cease capitalization on the portions substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy and capitalize only those costs associated with the portions under construction.

Table of Contents 

On a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indications that the value of our real estate properties may be impaired or that their carrying value may not be recoverable. A property's value is considered impaired if management's estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted) to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property as calculated in accordance with ASC 820. We assess for impairment indicators based on factors such as, among other things, market conditions, occupancy rates, rental payment collections, and operating performance of the asset. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate real estate investments for potential impairment primarily utilizing cash flow projections that apply, among other things, estimated revenue and expense growth rates, discount rates and capitalization rates, as well as sales comparison approach, which utilizes comparable sales, listings and sales contracts. 
 We also evaluate our real estate properties for impairment when a property has been classified as held for sale. Real estate assets held for sale are valued at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell and depreciation expense is no longer recorded. See Note 4, "Properties Held for Sale and Dispositions." 
 Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
 We account for our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting in cases where we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities and are not considered to be the primary beneficiary. We consolidate those joint ventures that we control or which are variable interest entities (each, a "VIE") and where we are considered to be the primary beneficiary. In all these joint ventures, the rights of the joint venture partner are both protective as well as participating. Unless we are determined to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, these participating rights preclude us from consolidating these VIE entities. Determining control of the entities can be subjective in assessing which activities of the joint venture most significantly impact the economic performance and whether the rights of the joint venture partner are protective or participating. In making this determination, any new or amended joint venture agreement is assessed by the Company for the activities that most significantly impact the joint venture s economic performance based on the business purpose and design of the venture. We assess the rights that are conveyed to us in the agreement and evaluate whether we are provided with participating or protective rights over the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance. We also assess the rights of our joint venture partner. Such participating rights include, among other things, the right to approve/amend the annual budget, leasing of the property to a significant tenant, and approval of tax returns and auditors. If our joint venture partner has substantive participating rights and we are determined not to be the primary beneficiary, we do not consolidate the entity. 
 These investments are recorded initially at cost, as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in net income (loss) and cash contributions and distributions. Equity in net income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures is allocated based on our ownership or economic interest in each joint venture and includes adjustments related to basis differences in accounting for the investment. When a capital event (as defined in each joint venture agreement) such as a refinancing occurs, if return thresholds are met, future equity income will be allocated at our increased economic interest. We recognize incentive income from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures as income to the extent it is earned and not subject to a clawback feature. Distributions we receive from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures in excess of our basis in the investment are recorded as offsets to our investment balance if we remain liable for future obligations of the joint venture or may otherwise be committed to provide future additional financial support. We generally finance our joint ventures with non-recourse debt. In certain cases we may provide guarantees or master leases for tenant space, which terminate upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans. 
 We assess our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for recoverability, and if it is determined that a loss in value of the investment is other than temporary, we write down the investment to its fair value. We evaluate our equity investments for impairment based on each joint ventures' actual and projected cash flows. We do not believe that the values of any of our equity investments were impaired as of December 31, 2022. 
 We may originate loans for real estate acquisition, development and construction ("ADC loans") where we expect to receive some of the residual profit from such projects. When the risk and rewards of these arrangements are essentially the same as an investor or joint venture partner, we account for these arrangements as real estate investments under the equity method of accounting for investments. Otherwise, we account for these arrangements consistent with the accounting for our debt and preferred equity investments.

Lease Classification 
 Lease classification for leases under which the Company is the lessor is evaluated at lease commencement and leases not classified as sales-type leases or direct financing leases are classified as operating leases. Leases qualify as sales-type leases if the contract includes either transfer of ownership clauses, certain purchase options, a lease term representing a major part of the economic life of the asset, or the present value of the lease payments and residual guarantees provided by the lessee exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset. Additionally, leasing an asset so specialized that it is not deemed to have any value to the Company at the end of the lease term may also result in classification as a sales-type lease. Leases qualify as direct financing leases when the present value of the lease payments and residual value guarantees provided by the lessee and unrelated third parties exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset and collection of the payments is probable. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Rental revenue for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and we have determined that the collectability of substantially all of the lease payments are probable. If collectability of substantially all of the lease payments is assessed as not probably, rental revenue is recognized only upon actual receipt. The Company assesses the probability of collecting substantially all payments under its leases based on multiple factors, including, among other things, payment history of the lessee, the credit rating of the lessee, historical operations and trends within the lessee s industry, current and future economic conditions. If collectability of substantially all of the lease payments is assessed as not probable, any difference between the rental revenue recognized to date and the lease payments that have been collected is recognized as a current-period adjustment to rental revenue. A subsequent change in the assessment of collectability to probable may result in a current-period adjustment to rental revenue for any difference between the rental revenue that would have been recognized if collectability had always been assessed as probable and the rental revenue recognized to date. 
 Rental revenue recognition commences when the leased space is available for its intended use by the lessee. To determine whether the leased space is available for its intended use by the lessee, management evaluates whether we are the owner of tenant improvements for accounting purposes or the tenant is. When management concludes that we are the owner of tenant improvements, rental revenue recognition begins when the tenant takes possession of the finished space, which is when such tenant improvements are substantially complete. In certain instances, when management concludes that we are not the owner of tenant improvements, rental revenue recognition begins when the tenant takes possession of or controls the space. 
 The excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases are included in deferred rents receivable on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 In addition to base rent, our tenants also generally will pay their pro rata share of increases in real estate taxes and certain operating expenses for the building over a base year. In some leases, in lieu of paying additional rent based upon increases in certain building operating expenses, the tenant will pay additional rent based upon increases in the wage rate paid to porters over the porters' wage rate in effect during a base year or increases in the consumer price index over the index value in effect during a base year. In addition, many of our leases contain fixed percentage increases over the base rent to cover escalations. Electricity is most often supplied by the landlord either on a sub-metered basis, or rent inclusion basis (i.e., a fixed fee is included in the rent for electricity, which amount may increase based upon increases in electricity rates or increases in electrical usage by the tenant). Base building services other than electricity (such as heat, air conditioning and freight elevator service during business hours, and base building cleaning) are typically provided at no additional cost, with the tenant paying additional rent only for services which exceed base building services or for services which are provided outside normal business hours. These escalations are based on actual expenses incurred in the prior calendar year. If the expenses in the current year are different from those in the prior year, then during the current year, the escalations will be adjusted to reflect the actual expenses for the current year. 
 Rental revenue is recognized if collectability is probable. If collectability of substantially all of the lease payments is assessed as not probable, any difference between the rental revenue recognized to date and the lease payments that have been collected is recognized as a current-period adjustment to rental revenue. A subsequent change in the assessment of collectability to probable may result in a current-period adjustment to rental revenue for any difference between the rental revenue that would have been recognized if collectability had always been assessed as probable and the rental revenue recognized to date. 
 The Company provides its tenants with certain customary services for lease contracts such as common area maintenance and general security. We have elected to combine the non-lease components with the lease components of our operating lease agreements and account for them as a single lease component in accordance with ASC 842. 
 We record a gain or loss on sale of real estate assets when we no longer have a controlling financial interest in the entity owning the real estate, a contract exists with a third party and that third party has control of the assets acquired.

Investment income on debt and preferred equity investments is accrued based on the contractual terms of the instruments and when it is deemed collectible. Some debt and preferred equity investments provide for accrual of interest at specified rates, which differ from current payment terms. Interest is recognized on such loans at the accrual rate subject to management's determination that accrued interest is collectible. If management cannot make this determination, interest income above the current pay rate is recognized only upon actual receipt. 
 The Company assesses the probability of a borrower s ability to repay the debt and preferred equity investment similar to the factors noted above. We consider a debt and preferred equity investment to be past due when amounts contractually due have not been paid. Debt and preferred equity investments are placed on a non-accrual status at the earlier of the date at which payments become 90 days past due or when, in the opinion of management, a full recovery of interest income becomes doubtful. Interest income recognition is resumed on any debt or preferred equity investment that is on non-accrual status when such debt or preferred equity investment becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed. 
 Deferred origination fees, original issue discounts and loan origination costs, if any, are recognized as an adjustment to interest income over the terms of the related investments using the effective interest method. Fees received in connection with loan commitments are also deferred until the loan is funded and are then recognized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to yield. Discounts or premiums associated with the purchase of loans are amortized or accreted into interest income as a yield adjustment on the effective interest method based on expected cash flows through the expected maturity date of the related investment. If we purchase a debt or preferred equity investment at a discount, intend to hold it until maturity and expect to recover the full value of the investment, we accrete the discount into income as an adjustment to yield over the term of the investment. If we purchase a debt or preferred equity investment at a discount with the intention of foreclosing on the collateral, we do not accrete the discount. For debt investments acquired at a discount for credit quality, the difference between contractual cash flows and expected cash flows at acquisition is not accreted. Anticipated exit fees, the collection of which is expected, are also recognized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to yield. 
 We consider a debt and preferred equity investment to be past due when amounts contractually due have not been paid. Debt and preferred equity investments are placed on a non-accrual status when, in the opinion of management, a full recovery of interest income becomes doubtful. Interest income recognition is resumed on any debt or preferred equity investment when the performance of such non-accrual debt or preferred equity investment is demonstrated to be resumed. 
 We may syndicate a portion of the loans that we originate or sell the loans individually. When a transaction meets the criteria for sale accounting, we recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the sales price and the carrying value of the loan sold. Any related unamortized deferred origination fees, original issue discounts, loan origination costs, discounts or premiums at the time of sale are recognized as an adjustment to the gain or loss on sale, which is included in investment income on the consolidated statement of operations. Any fees received at the time of sale or syndication are recognized as part of investment income. 
 Asset management fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the asset management agreement. 
 Debt and Preferred Equity Investments 
 Debt and preferred equity investments are presented at the net amount expected to be collected in accordance with ASC 326. An allowance for loan losses is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected through the expected maturity date of such investments. The expense for loan loss and other investment reserves is the charge to earnings to adjust the allowance for loan losses to the appropriate level. Amounts are written off from the allowance when we de-recognize the related investment either as a result of a sale of the investment or acquisition of equity interests in the collateral. 
 The Company evaluates the amount expected to be collected based on current market and economic conditions, historical loss information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company's assumptions are derived from both internal data and external data which may include, among others, governmental economic projections for the New York City Metropolitan area, public data on recent transactions and filings for securitized debt instruments. This information is aggregated by asset class and adjusted for duration. Based on these inputs, loans are evaluated at the individual asset level. In certain instances, we may also use a probability-weighted model that considers the likelihood of multiple outcomes and the amount expected to be collected for each outcome. 
 The evaluation of the possible credit deterioration associated with the performance and/or value of the underlying collateral property as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower/sponsor requires significant judgment, which include both asset level and market assumptions over the relevant time period.

In addition, quarterly, the Company assigns each loan a risk rating. Based on a 3-point scale, loans are rated 1 through 3, from lower risk to higher risk, which ratings are defined as follows: 1 - Low Risk Assets - Low probability of loss, 2 - Watch List Assets - Higher potential for loss, 3 - High Risk Assets - Loss more likely than not. Loans with risk ratings of 2 or 3 are evaluated to determine whether the expected risk of loss is appropriately captured through the combination of our expectations of current conditions, historical loss information and supportable forecasts described above or whether risk characteristics specific to the loan warrant the use of a probability-weighted model. 
 Financing investments that are classified as held for sale are carried at the expected amount to be collected or fair market value using available market information obtained through consultation with dealers or other originators of such investments as well as discounted cash flow models based on Level 3 data pursuant to ASC 820-10. As circumstances change, management may conclude not to sell an investment designated as held for sale. In such situations, the investment will be reclassified at its expected amount to be collected. 
 Other financing receivables that are included in balance sheet line items other than the Debt and preferred equity investments line are also measured at the net amount expected to the be collected. 
 Accrued interest receivable amounts related to these debt and preferred equity investment and other financing receivables are recorded at the net amount expected to be collected within Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Write offs of accrued interest receivables are recognized as an expense for loan loss and other investment reserves.

 Investment Income 
 Investment income increased primarily as a result of an increase in the weighted average yield of our debt and preferred equity investments due to recognition of previously unrecorded default interest on our preferred equity investment at 245 Park Avenue in the third quarter of 2022. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the weighted average balance of our debt and preferred equity investment portfolio and the weighted average yield were 1.0 billion and 8.3 , respectively, compared to 1.1 billion and 7.1 , respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the debt and preferred equity investment portfolio had a weighted average term to maturity of 1.4 years excluding extension options. 
 Other Income 
 Other income decreased primarily due to lower lease termination income for the year ended December 31, 2022 5.4 million) as compared to the same period in 2021 22.6 million), and a decrease in acquisition fee income related to joint venture properties 2.5 million). This decrease was offset by an increase in construction fee income 6.2 million), and income related to the resolution of the Company's investment in 1591-1597 Broadway 5.0 million).

 Equity in net loss from unconsolidated joint ventures 
 Equity in net loss from unconsolidated joint ventures increased primarily as a result of increased interest expense across our joint venture portfolio 28.3 million) and a decrease in income from operations at Worldwide Plaza 3.7 million), 450 Park Avenue 3.2 million) and 919 Third Avenue 3.1 million). This was offset by an increase in income from operations at One Vanderbilt Avenue 28.6 million), 1515 Broadway 6.3 million) and 220 East 42nd Street 5.0 million). 
 Equity in net loss on sale of interest in unconsolidated joint venture/real estate 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a loss on the sale of our interest in the Stonehenge Portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized losses on the sales of our interest in One Madison Avenue 26.9 million), 55 West 46th Street 15.3 million) and 400 East 57th Street 1.5 million), offset by a gain on the sale of our interest in 605 West 42nd Street 8.3 million).

 Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 to the year ended December 31, 2020 
 For a comparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 to the year ended December 31, 2020, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the SEC on February 18, 2022. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We currently expect that the principal sources of funds to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements for working capital, acquisitions, development or redevelopment of properties, tenant improvements, leasing costs, share repurchases, dividends to shareholders, distributions to unitholders, repurchases or repayments of outstanding indebtedness and for debt and preferred equity investments will include: 
 (1) Cash flow from operations; 
 (2) Cash on hand; 
 (3) Net proceeds from divestitures of properties and redemptions, participations, dispositions and repayments of debt and preferred equity investments; 
 (4) Borrowings under the revolving credit facility; 
 (5) Other forms of secured or unsecured financing; and 
 (6) Proceeds from common or preferred equity or debt offerings by the Company or the Operating Partnership (including issuances of units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership and Trust preferred securities). 
 Cash flow from operations is primarily dependent upon the collectability of rent, the occupancy level of our portfolio, the net effective rental rates achieved on our leases, the collectability of rent, operating escalations and recoveries from our tenants and the level of operating and other costs. Additionally, we believe that our debt and preferred equity investment program will continue to serve as a source of operating cash flow.

 We estimate that for the year ending December 31, 2023, we expect to incur 82.0 million of recurring capital expenditures on existing consolidated properties and 117.5 million of development or redevelopment expenditures on existing consolidated properties, of which 1.2 million will be funded by construction financing facilities or loan reserves. We expect our share of capital expenditures at our joint venture properties will be 263.1 million, of which 160.7 million will be funded by construction financing facilities or loan reserves. We expect to fund capital expenditures from operating cash flow, existing liquidity, and borrowings from construction financing facilities. Future property acquisitions may require substantial capital investments for refurbishment and leasing costs. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had liquidity of 1.0 billion, comprised of 800.0 million of availability under our revolving credit facility and 214.5 million of consolidated cash on hand, inclusive of 11.2 million of marketable securities. This liquidity excludes 143.8 million representing our share of cash at unconsolidated joint venture properties. We may seek to divest of properties, interests in properties, or debt and preferred equity investments or access private and public debt and equity capital when the opportunity presents itself, although there is no guarantee that this capital will be made available to us at efficient levels or at all. Management believes that these sources of liquidity, if we are able to access them, along with potential refinancing opportunities for secured and unsecured debt, will allow us to satisfy our debt and other obligations, as described above, upon maturity, if not before. 
 We have investments in several real estate joint ventures with various partners who are generally considered to be financially stable. Most of our joint ventures are financed with non-recourse debt. We believe that property level cash flows along with unfunded committed indebtedness and proceeds from the refinancing of outstanding secured indebtedness will be sufficient to fund the capital needs of our joint venture properties. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on our consolidated statements of cash flows in "Item 1. Financial Statements" and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the years presented below. 
 Cash, restricted cash, and cash equivalents were 384.1 million and 337.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing a increase of 47.1 million. The increase was a result of the following changes in cash flows (in thousands): 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (Decrease) Increase Net cash provided by operating activities 276,088 255,979 20,109 Net cash provided by investing activities 425,805 993,581 (567,776) Net cash used in financing activities (654,823) (1,285,371) 630,548 
 Our principal sources of operating cash flow are the properties in our consolidated and joint venture portfolios and our debt and preferred equity portfolio. These sources generate a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service, and fund dividend and distribution requirements.

Cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development or redevelopment projects and recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures. We selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing and property management skills, and invest in existing buildings that meet our investment criteria. During the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, we used cash primarily for the following investing activities (in thousands): 
 Acquisitions of real estate 88,300 Capital expenditures and capitalized interest 1,716 Joint venture investments (95,646) Distributions from joint ventures (628,862) Proceeds from sales of real estate/partial interest in property (25,230) Cash and restricted cash assumed from acquisition of real estate investment 60,494 Cash assumed from consolidation of real estate investment (9,475) Debt and preferred equity and other investments 40,927 Decrease in net cash provided by investing activities (567,776) 
 Funds spent on capital expenditures, which are comprised of building and tenant improvements, decreased from 302.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 300.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 due to lower costs incurred in connection with our development and redevelopment properties. 
 We generally fund our investment activity through the sale of real estate, the sale of debt and preferred equity investments, property-level financing, our credit facilities, senior unsecured notes, and construction loans. From time to time, the Company may issue common or preferred stock, or the Operating Partnership may issue common or preferred units of limited partnership interest. During the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, we used cash for the following financing activities (in thousands): 
 Proceeds from our debt obligations 378,291 Repayments of our debt obligations 26,680 Net distribution to noncontrolling interests 53,237 Other financing activities 15,970 Proceeds from stock options exercised and DRSPP issuance (1,031) Repurchase of common stock 190,206 Redemption of preferred stock (11,927) Acquisition of subsidiary interest from noncontrolling interest (29,817) Dividends and distributions paid 8,939 Decrease in net cash used in financing activities 630,548

 Share Repurchase Program 
 In August 2016, our Board of Directors approved a 1.0 billion share repurchase program under which we could buy shares of our common stock. The Board of Directors has since authorized five separate 500.0 million increases to the size of the share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2017, second quarter of 2018, fourth quarter of 2018, fourth quarter of 2019, and fourth quarter of 2020 bringing the total program size to 3.5 billion.

 Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan ("DRSPP") 
 In February 2018, the Company filed a registration statement with the SEC for our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan, or DRSPP, which automatically became effective upon filing. The Company registered 3,500,000 shares of our common stock under the DRSPP. The DRSPP commenced on September 24, 2001. 
 The following table summarizes SL Green common stock issued, and proceeds received from dividend reinvestments and/or stock purchases under the DRSPP for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively (dollars in thousands):

 Fifth Amended and Restated 2005 Stock Option and Incentive Plan 
 The Fifth Amended and Restated 2005 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, or the 2005 Plan, was approved by the Company's Board of Directors in April 2022 and its stockholders in June 2022 at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders. Subject to adjustments upon certain corporate transactions or events, awards with respect to up to a maximum of 32,210,000 fungible units may be granted as options, restricted stock, phantom shares, dividend equivalent rights and other equity-based awards under the 2005 Plan. As of December 31, 2022, 6.3 million fungible units were available for issuance under the 2005 Plan after reserving for shares underlying outstanding restricted stock units and phantom stock units granted pursuant to our Non-Employee Directors' Deferral Program and LTIP Units. 
 Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors 
 Under our Non-Employee Director's Deferral Program, which commenced July 2004, the Company's non-employee directors may elect to defer up to 100 of their annual retainer fee, chairman fees, meeting fees and annual stock grant. Unless otherwise elected by a participant, fees deferred under the program shall be credited in the form of phantom stock units. The program provides that a director's phantom stock units generally will be settled in an equal number of shares of common stock upon the earlier of (i) the January 1 coincident with or the next following such director's termination of service from the Board of Directors or (ii) a change in control by us, as defined by the program. Phantom stock units are credited to each non-employee director quarterly using the closing price of our common stock on the first business day of the respective quarter. Each participating non-employee director is also credited with dividend equivalents or phantom stock units based on the dividend rate for each quarter, which are either paid in cash currently or credited to the director s account as additional phantom stock units. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, 27,436 phantom stock units and 9,571 shares of common stock were issued to our Board of Directors. We recorded compensation expense of 2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 related to the Deferred Compensation Plan. As of December 31, 2022, there were 192,638 phantom stock units outstanding pursuant to our Non-Employee Director's Deferral Program.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
 In 2007, the Company's Board of Directors adopted the 2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, to provide equity-based incentives to eligible employees. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" under Section 423 of the Code, and has been adopted by the board to enable our eligible employees to purchase the Company's shares of common stock through payroll deductions. The ESPP became effective on January 1, 2008 with a maximum of 500,000 shares of the common stock available for issuance, subject to adjustment upon a merger, reorganization, stock split or other similar corporate change. The Company filed a registration statement on Form S-8 with the SEC with respect to the ESPP. The common stock is offered for purchase through a series of successive offering periods. Each offering period will be three months in duration and will begin on the first day of each calendar quarter, with the first offering period having commenced on January 1, 2008. The ESPP provides for eligible employees to purchase the common stock at a purchase price equal to 85 of the lesser of (1) the market value of the common stock on the first day of the offering period or (2) the market value of the common stock on the last day of the offering period. The ESPP was approved by our stockholders at our 2008 annual meeting of stockholders. As of December 31, 2022, 191,845 shares of our common stock had been issued under the ESPP.

 Certain of our debt and equity investments and other investments, with carrying values of 144.1 million as of December 31, 2022 and 295.0 million as of December 31, 2021, are variable rate investments, which mitigate our exposure to interest rate changes on our unhedged variable rate debt. Inclusive of the mitigating effect of these investments, the net ratio of our variable rate debt to total debt was 7.0 and 13.4 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Mortgage Financing

 2021 Credit Facility 
 In December 2021, we entered into an amended and restated credit facility, referred to as the 2021 credit facility, that was previously amended by the Company in November 2017, or the 2017 credit facility, and was originally entered into by the Company in November 2012, or the 2012 credit facility. As of December 31, 2022, the 2021 credit facility consisted of a 1.25 billion revolving credit facility, a 1.05 billion term loan (or "Term Loan A"), and a 200.0 million term loan (or "Term Loan B") with maturity dates of May 15, 2026, May 15, 2027, and November 21, 2024, respectively. The revolving credit facility has two six-month as-of-right extension options to May 15, 2027. We also have an option, subject to customary conditions, to increase the capacity of the credit facility to 4.5 billion at any time prior to the maturity dates for the revolving credit facility and term loans without the consent of existing lenders, by obtaining additional commitments from our existing lenders and other financial institutions. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the 2021 credit facility bore interest at a spread over adjusted Term SOFR plus 10 basis points with an interest period of one or three months, as we may elect, ranging from (i) 72.5 basis points to 140 basis points for loans under the revolving credit facility, (ii) 80 basis points to 160 basis points for loans under Term Loan A, and (iii) 85 basis points to 165 basis points for loans under Term Loan B, in each case based on the credit rating assigned to the senior unsecured long term indebtedness of the Company. In instances where there are either only two ratings available or where there are more than two and the difference between them is one rating category, the applicable rating shall be the highest rating. In instances where there are more than two ratings and the difference between the highest and the lowest is two or more rating categories, then the applicable rating used is the average of the highest two, rounded down if the average is not a recognized category. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the applicable spread over adjusted Term SOFR plus 10 basis points was 105 basis points for the revolving credit facility, 120 basis points for Term Loan A, and 125 basis points for Term Loan B. We are required to pay quarterly in arrears a 12.5 to 30 basis point facility fee on the total commitments under the revolving credit facility based on the credit rating assigned to the senior unsecured long term indebtedness of the Company. As of December 31, 2022, the facility fee was 25 basis points. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 2.0 million of outstanding letters of credit, 450.0 million drawn under the revolving credit facility and 1.25 billion outstanding under the term loan facilities, with total undrawn capacity of 800.0 million under the 2021 credit facility. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the revolving credit facility had a carrying value of 443.2 million and 381.3 million, respectively, net of deferred financing costs. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the term loan facilities had a carrying value of 1.2 billion and 1.2 billion, respectively, net of deferred financing costs. 
 The Company and the Operating Partnership are borrowers jointly and severally obligated under the 2021 credit facility. 
 The 2021 credit facility includes certain restrictions and covenants (see Restrictive Covenants below). 
 2022 Term Loan 
 In October 2022, we entered into a term loan agreement, referred to as the 2022 term loan. As of December 31, 2022, the 2022 term loan consisted of a 400.0 million term loan with a maturity date of October 6, 2023. The 2022 term loan has one six-month as-of-right extension option to April 6, 2024. We also have an option, subject to customary conditions, to increase the capacity of the 2022 term loan to 500.0 million on or before January 7, 2023 without the consent of existing lenders, by obtaining additional commitments from our existing lenders and other financial institutions. In January 2023, the 2022 term loan was increased by 25.0 million to 425.0 million. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the 2022 term loan bore interest at a spread over adjusted Term SOFR plus 10 basis points, ranging from 100 basis points to 180 basis points, in each case based on the credit rating assigned to the senior unsecured long-term indebtedness of the Company. In instances where there are either only two ratings available or where there are more than two and the difference between them is one rating category, the applicable rating shall be the highest rating. In instances where there are more than two ratings and the difference between the highest and the lowest is two or more rating categories, then the applicable rating used is the average of the highest two, rounded down if the average is not a recognized category. As of December 31, 2022, the applicable spread over adjusted Term SOFR plus 10 basis points was 140 basis points. As of December 31, 2022, the 2022 term loan had a carrying value of 398.2 million, net of deferred financing costs. 
 The Company and the Operating Partnership are borrowers jointly and severally obligated under the 2022 term loan. 
 The 2022 term loan includes certain restrictions and covenants (see Restrictive Covenants below).

Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ("FHLB") Facility 
 As of December 31, 2020, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, Ticonderoga Insurance Company, or Ticonderoga, a Vermont licensed captive insurance company, was a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, or FHLBNY. As a member, Ticonderoga was able to borrow funds from the FHLBNY in the form of secured advances that bore interest at a floating rate. As a result of a Final Ruling from the Federal Housing Finance Authority, the regulator of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, all captive insurance company memberships were terminated as of February 2021. As such, all advances to Ticonderoga were repaid prior to such termination. 
 Master Repurchase Agreement 
 The Company entered into a Master Repurchase Agreement, or MRA, known as the 2017 MRA, which provided us with the ability to sell certain mortgage investments with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the same at a certain date or on demand. In April 2018, we increased the maximum facility capacity from 300.0 million to 400.0 million. The facility bore interest on a floating rate basis at a spread to 30-day LIBOR based on the pledged collateral and advanced rate. The facility matured in June 2022 and was not extended. 
 Senior Unsecured Notes 
 The following table sets forth our senior unsecured notes and other related disclosures as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, by scheduled maturity date (dollars in thousands):

 (2) Issued by the Company and the Operating Partnership as co-obligors. 
 (3) Issued by the Operating Partnership with the Company as the guarantor. 
 
 Restrictive Covenants 
 The terms of the 2021 credit facility, 2022 term loan and certain of our senior unsecured notes include certain restrictions and covenants which may limit, among other things, our ability to pay dividends, make certain types of investments, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens and enter into negative pledge agreements and dispose of assets, and which require compliance with financial ratios relating to the maximum ratio of total indebtedness to total asset value, a minimum ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges, a maximum ratio of secured indebtedness to total asset value and a maximum ratio of unsecured indebtedness to unencumbered asset value. The dividend restriction referred to above provides that we will not, during any time when a default is continuing, make distributions with respect to common stock or other equity interests, except to enable the Company to continue to qualify as a REIT for Federal income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we were in compliance with all such covenants. 
 Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures 
 In June 2005, the Company and the Operating Partnership issued 100.0 million in unsecured trust preferred securities through a newly formed trust, SL Green Capital Trust I, or the Trust, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership. The securities mature in 2035 and bear interest at a floating rate of 125 basis points over the three-month LIBOR. Interest payments may be deferred for a period of up to eight consecutive quarters if the Operating Partnership exercises its right to defer such payments. The Trust preferred securities are redeemable at the option of the Operating Partnership, in whole or in part, with no prepayment premium. We do not consolidate the Trust even though it is a variable interest entity as we are not the primary beneficiary. Because the Trust is not consolidated, we have recorded the debt on our consolidated balance sheets and the related payments are classified as interest expense.

Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our variable rate debt. Our exposure to interest rate fluctuations are managed through either the use of interest rate derivative instruments and/or through our variable rate debt and preferred equity investments. Based on the debt outstanding as of December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the floating rate interest rate curve would increase our consolidated annual interest cost, net of interest income from variable rate debt and preferred equity investments, by 3.5 million and would increase our share of joint venture annual interest cost by 6.5 million. As of December 31, 2022, 144.1 million, or 23.1 , of our 0.6 billion debt and preferred equity portfolio was indexed to LIBOR. 
 We recognize most derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through income. If a derivative is considered a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset, liability, or firm commitment through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. 
 Our long-term debt of 5.0 billion bears interest at fixed rates, and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in the market interest rates. Our variable rate debt and variable rate joint venture debt as of December 31, 2022 bore interest based on a spread to LIBOR of 145 basis points to 340 basis points, and adjusted Term SOFR of 115 basis points to 577 basis points. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have off-balance sheet investments, including joint ventures and debt and preferred equity investments. These investments all have varying ownership structures. A majority of our joint venture arrangements are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial decisions of these joint venture arrangements. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are discussed in Note 5, "Debt and Preferred Equity Investments" and Note 6, "Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Dividends/Distributions 
 We expect to pay dividends to our stockholders based on the distributions we receive from our Operating Partnership. 
 To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must pay annual dividends to our stockholders of at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined before taking into consideration the dividends paid deduction and net capital gains. 
 Any dividend we pay may be in the form of cash, stock, or a combination thereof, subject to IRS limitations on the use of stock for dividends. Additionally, if our REIT taxable income in a particular year exceeds the amount of cash dividends we pay in that year, we may pay stock dividends in order to maintain our REIT status and avoid certain REIT-level taxes. 
 Before we pay any cash dividend, whether for Federal income tax purposes or otherwise, which would only be paid out of available cash to the extent permitted under the 2021 credit facility, 2022 term loan and senior unsecured notes, we must first meet both our operating requirements and scheduled debt service on our mortgages and loans payable. 
 
 Related Party Transactions 
 Cleaning/ Security/ Messenger and Restoration Services 
 Alliance Building Services, or Alliance, and its affiliates, which provide services to certain properties owned by us, were previously partially owned by Gary Green, a son of Stephen L. Green, who serves as a member and as the chairman emeritus of our Board of Directors. Alliance s affiliates include First Quality Maintenance, L.P., or First Quality, Classic Security LLC, Bright Star Couriers LLC and Onyx Restoration Works, and provide cleaning, extermination, security, messenger, and restoration services, respectively. In addition, First Quality has the non-exclusive opportunity to provide cleaning and related services to individual tenants at our properties on a basis separately negotiated with any tenant seeking such additional services. The Service Corporation has entered into an arrangement with Alliance whereby it will receive a profit participation above a certain threshold for services provided by Alliance to certain tenants at certain buildings above the base services specified in their lease agreements. 
 Income earned from the profit participation, which is included in Other income on the consolidated statements of operations, was 1.4 million, 1.7 million and 1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 We also recorded expenses, inclusive of capitalized expenses, of 8.6 million, 14.0 million and 13.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for these services (excluding services provided directly to tenants).

Management Fees 
 S.L. Green Management Corp., a consolidated entity, receives property management fees from an entity in which Stephen L. Green owns an interest. We received management fees from this entity of 0.6 million, 0.7 million and 0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 respectively. 
 One Vanderbilt Avenue Investment 
 In December 2016, we entered into agreements with entities owned and controlled by our Chairman and CEO, Marc Holliday, and our President, Andrew Mathias, pursuant to which they agreed to make an investment in our One Vanderbilt project (inclusive of the property and Summit One Vanderbilt) at the appraised fair market value for the interests acquired. This investment entitles these entities to receive approximately 1.50 - 1.80 and 1.00 - 1.20 , respectively, of any profits realized by the Company from its One Vanderbilt project in excess of the Company s capital contributions. The entities have no right to any return of capital. Accordingly, subject to previously disclosed repurchase rights, these interests will have no value and will not entitle these entities to any amounts (other than limited distributions to cover tax liabilities incurred) unless and until the Company has received distributions from the One Vanderbilt project in excess of the Company s aggregate investment in the project. In the event that the Company does not realize a profit on its investment in the project (or would not realize a profit based on the value at the time the interests are repurchased), the entities owned and controlled by Messrs. Holliday and Mathias will lose the entire amount of their investment. The entities owned and controlled by Messrs. Holliday and Mathias paid 1.4 million and 1.0 million, respectively, which equaled the fair market value of the interests acquired as of the date the investment agreements were entered into as determined by an independent third party appraisal that we obtained. 
 Messrs. Holliday and Mathias have the right to tender their interests in the project upon stabilization (50 within three years after stabilization and 100 three years or more after stabilization). In addition, the agreement calls for us to repurchase these interests in the event of a sale of One Vanderbilt or a transactional change of control of the Company. We also have the right to repurchase these interests on the 7-year anniversary of the stabilization of the project or upon the occurrence of certain separation events prior to the stabilization of the project relating to each of Messrs. Holliday s and Mathias s continued service with us. The price paid upon a tender of the interests will equal the liquidation value of the interests at the time, with the value being based on the project's sale price, if applicable, or fair market value as determined by an independent third party appraiser. In 2022, stabilization of the property (but not Summit One Vanderbilt) was achieved. Therefore, Messrs. Holiday and Mathias exercised their rights to tender 50 of their interests in the property (but not Summit One Vanderbilt) for liquidation values of 17.9 million and 11.9 million, respectively, which were paid in July 2022. 
 One Vanderbilt Avenue Leases 
 In November 2018, we entered into a lease agreement with the One Vanderbilt Avenue joint venture covering certain floors at the property. In March 2021, the lease commenced and we relocated our corporate headquarters to the leased space. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 we recorded 3.0 million and 2.4 million, respectively, of rent expense under the lease. Additionally, in June 2021, we, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a lease agreement with the One Vanderbilt Avenue joint venture for Summit One Vanderbilt, which commenced operations in October 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded 33.0 million of rent expense under the lease, including percentage rent, of which 22.8 million was recognized as income as a component of Equity in net loss from unconsolidated joint ventures in our consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded 5.0 million of rent expense under the lease with no percentage rent. See Note 20, "Commitments and Contingencies." 
 Insurance 
 We maintain all-risk property and rental value coverage (including coverage regarding the perils of flood, earthquake and terrorism, excluding nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological terrorism ("NBCR")), within two property insurance programs and liability insurance. Separate property and liability coverage may be purchased on a stand-alone basis for certain assets, such as development projects. Additionally, one of our captive insurance companies, Belmont Insurance Company, or Belmont, provides coverage for NBCR terrorist acts above a specified trigger. Belmont's retention is reinsured by our other captive insurance company, Ticonderoga Insurance Company ("Ticonderoga"). If Belmont or Ticonderoga are required to pay a claim under our insurance policies, we would ultimately record the loss to the extent of required payments. However, there is no assurance that in the future we will be able to procure coverage at a reasonable cost. Further, if we experience losses that are uninsured or that exceed policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties. Additionally, our debt instruments contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance and we could default under our debt instruments if the cost and/or availability of certain types of insurance make it impractical or impossible to comply with such covenants relating to insurance. Belmont and Ticonderoga provide coverage solely on properties owned by the Company or its affiliates.

Furthermore, with respect to certain of our properties, including properties held by joint ventures or subject to triple net leases, insurance coverage is obtained by a third-party and we do not control the coverage. While we may have agreements with such third parties to maintain adequate coverage and we monitor these policies, such coverage ultimately may not be maintained or adequately cover our risk of loss. 
 
 Funds from Operations 
 FFO is a widely recognized non-GAAP financial measure of REIT performance. The Company computes FFO in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, or that interpret the NAREIT definition differently than the Company does. The revised White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in April 2002, and subsequently amended in December 2018, defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of properties , and real estate related impairment charges, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. 
 The Company presents FFO because it considers it an important supplemental measure of the Company s operating performance and believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, particularly those that own and operate commercial office properties. The Company also uses FFO as one of several criteria to determine performance-based compensation for members of its senior management. FFO is intended to exclude GAAP historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time. Historically, however, real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate, gains and losses from property dispositions, and real estate related impairment charges, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, and interest costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income.

 Inflation 
 Substantially all of our office leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations as well as operating expense recoveries based on increases in the CPI or other measures such as porters' wage. In addition, many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases. We believe that inflationary increases will be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and expense escalations described above.

Climate Change 
 With our roots in New York City, we are at the center of one of the world's most ambitious climate legislative environments. Through the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act signed into law in 2019, New York State mandated the adoption of a net-zero carbon economy statewide by 2050, with a zero-carbon electricity grid by 2040. New York City enacted Local Law 97 (LL97) in 2019 under the Climate Mobilization Act, setting carbon caps for large buildings starting in 2024 as part of a broader commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 by 2030, and by 80 by 2050. As our portfolio is principally located in Manhattan, these policy elements represent the most material sources of transition risks relevant to our business. We do not anticipate any material financial impact on our portfolio in the first compliance period of 2024 to 2029. 
 While SL Green's portfolio has not been substantially affected by climate-related events to New York City real estate, such as Hurricane Sandy in 2012, we have continued to develop our approach to physical climate risk assessment, management, and mitigation in order to manage and minimize the impacts of future events. We have conducted climate-related scenario analyses as part of our first Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ("TCFD") report published in 2021, which we made available on our website. The Company is also committed to setting near-term Scope 1 and Scope 2 science-based emissions reduction targets with the SBTi, which are currently in the validation process. Our goal is to reduce emissions for our operationally controlled portfolio to align it with the 1.5 degree Celsius climate scenario. 
 We consider the successful management and mitigation of climate-related risks across our portfolio as an opportunity to raise the financial value of our buildings and pass on these benefits to our stakeholders, tenants, and investors. We believe our investments over the last 20 years in energy efficiency improvements and greenhouse gas emissions reductions have minimized the impact of climate legislation on our portfolio and our active development pipeline sets the standard for sustainable new construction and responsible community engagement. We leverage years of operational excellence to incorporate innovative design and technological solutions. We also utilize recommendations from our portfolio-wide New York State Energy Research and Development Authority ("NYSERDA") emissions reduction study to help lower emissions from tenant spaces and base building operations. Together, these measures are expected to minimize our vulnerability to the physical risks of climate change, as well as transition risks covering policy and legal, market, technology, and reputational factors.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of SL Green Realty Corp. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SL Green Realty Corp. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 16, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Joint Venture Consolidation Assessment Description of the Matter The Company accounted for certain investments in real estate joint ventures under the equity method of accounting and consolidated certain other investments in real estate joint ventures. At December 31, 2022, the Company s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures was 3.2 billion and noncontrolling interests in consolidated other partnerships was 61.9 million. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, for each joint venture, the Company evaluated the rights provided to each party in the venture to assess the consolidation of the venture. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit Auditing management s joint venture consolidation analyses was complex and highly judgmental due to the subjectivity in assessing which activities most significantly impact a joint venture s economic performance based on the purpose and design of the entity over the duration of its expected life and assessing which party has rights to direct those activities. We tested the Company s controls over the assessment of joint venture consolidation. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the consolidation analyses for newly formed ventures as well as controls over management's identification of reconsideration events which could trigger modified consolidation conclusions for existing ventures. 
 
 To test the Company s consolidation assessment for real estate joint ventures, our procedures included, among others, reviewing new and amended joint venture agreements and discussing with management the nature of the rights conveyed to the Company through the joint venture agreements as well as the business purpose of the joint venture transactions. We reviewed management s assessment of the activities that would most significantly impact the joint venture s economic performance and evaluated whether the joint venture agreements provided participating or protective rights to the Company. We also evaluated transactions with the joint ventures for events which would require a reconsideration of previous consolidation conclusions.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Partners of SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SL Green Operating Partnership, L.P. (the Operating Partnership) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, capital and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Operating Partnership at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Operating Partnership's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 16, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Joint Venture Consolidation Assessment Description of the Matter The Operating Partnership accounted for certain investments in real estate joint ventures under the equity method of accounting and consolidated certain other investments in real estate joint ventures. At December 31, 2022, the Operating Partnership s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures was 3.2 billion and noncontrolling interests in consolidated other partnerships was 61.9 million. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, for each joint venture, the Operating Partnership evaluated the rights provided to each party in the venture to assess the consolidation of the venture. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit Auditing management s joint venture consolidation analyses was complex and highly judgmental due to the subjectivity in assessing which activities most significantly impact a joint venture s economic performance based on the purpose and design of the entity over the duration of its expected life and assessing which party has rights to direct those activities. We tested the Operating Partnership s controls over the assessment of joint venture consolidation. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the consolidation analyses for newly formed ventures as well as controls over management's identification of reconsideration events which could trigger modified consolidation conclusions for existing ventures. 
 
 To test the Operating Partnership s consolidation assessment for real estate joint ventures, our procedures included, among others, reviewing new and amended joint venture agreements and discussing with management the nature of the rights conveyed to the Operating Partnership through the joint venture agreements as well as the business purpose of the joint venture transactions. We reviewed management s assessment of the activities that would most significantly impact the joint venture s economic performance and evaluated whether the joint venture agreements provided participating or protective rights to the Operating Partnership. We also evaluated transactions with the joint ventures for events which would require a reconsideration of previous consolidation conclusions.

 We have served as the Operating Partnership's auditor since 2010.

 of the economic interest in the management, leasing and construction companies which are referred to as S.L. Green Management Corp, or the Service Corporation. All of the management, leasing and construction services that are provided to the properties that are wholly-owned by us and that are provided to certain joint ventures are conducted through SL Green Management LLC and S.L. Green Management Corp., respectively, which are owned by the Operating Partnership. The Company has qualified, and expects to qualify in the current fiscal year, as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and operates as a self-administered, self-managed REIT. A REIT is a legal entity that holds real estate interests and, through payments of dividends to stockholders, is permitted to minimize the payment of Federal income taxes at the corporate level. Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to "we," "our" and "us" means the Company and all entities owned or controlled by the Company, including the Operating Partnership. 
 Substantially all of our assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership. The Company is the sole managing general partner of the Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2022, noncontrolling investors held, in the aggregate, a limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. We refer to these interests as the noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership is considered a variable interest entity, or VIE, in which we are the primary beneficiary. See Note 11, "Noncontrolling Interests on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements."

 (1) The weighted average occupancy for commercial properties represents the total occupied square footage divided by the total square footage at acquisition. The weighted average occupancy for residential properties represents the total occupied units divided by the total available units. Properties under construction are not included in the calculation of weighted average occupancy. 
 (2) As of December 31, 2022, we owned a building at 7 Dey Street / 185 Broadway that was comprised of approximately square feet (unaudited) of residential space and approximately square feet (unaudited) of office and retail space that is under development. For the purpose of this report, we have included this building in the number of residential properties we own. However, we have included only the residential square footage in the residential approximate square footage, and have listed the balance of the square footage as development square footage.

 Partnership Agreement 
 In accordance with the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership, or the Operating Partnership Agreement, we allocate all distributions and profits and losses in proportion to the percentage of ownership interests of the respective partners, subject to the priority distributions with respect to preferred units and special provisions that apply to Long Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") Units. As the managing general partner of the Operating Partnership, we are required to take such reasonable efforts, as determined by us in our sole discretion, to cause the Operating Partnership to distribute sufficient amounts to enable the payment of sufficient dividends by us to minimize any Federal income or excise tax at the Company level. Under the Operating Partnership Agreement, each limited partner has the right to redeem units of limited partnership interests for cash, or if we so elect, shares of SL Green's common stock on a one-for- basis.

 years to years. We amortize the amount allocated to the above- and below-market leases over the remaining term of the associated lease, which generally range from year to years, and record it as either an increase (in the case of below-market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above-market leases) to rental income. We amortize the amount allocated to the values associated with in-place leases over the expected term of the associated lease, which generally ranges from year to years. If a tenant vacates its space prior to the contractual termination of the lease and no rental payments are being made on the lease, any unamortized balance of the related intangible will be written off. The tenant improvements and origination costs are amortized as an expense over the remaining life of the lease (or charged against earnings if the lease is terminated prior to its contractual expiration date). We assess fair value of the leases based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property. To the extent acquired leases contain fixed rate renewal options that are below-market and determined to be material, we amortize such below-market lease value into rental income over the renewal period. As of December 31, 2022, the weighted average amortization period for above-market leases, below-market leases, and in-place lease costs is years, years, and years, respectively. 
 The Company classifies those leases under which the Company is the lessee at lease commencement as finance or operating leases. Leases qualify as finance leases if the lease transfers ownership of the asset at the end of the lease term, the lease grants an option to purchase the asset that we are reasonably certain to exercise, the lease term is for a major part of the remaining economic life of the asset, or the present value of the lease payments exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset. Leases that do not qualify as finance leases are deemed to be operating leases. At lease commencement the Company records a lease liability which is measured as the present value of the lease payments and a right of use asset which is measured as the amount of the lease liability and any initial direct costs incurred. The Company applies a discount rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. If the rate implicit in the lease is known, the Company uses that rate. If the rate implicit in the lease is not known, the Company uses a discount rate reflective of the Company s collateralized borrowing rate given the term of the lease. To determine the discount rate, the Company employs a third party specialist to develop an analysis based primarily on the observable borrowing rates of the Company, other REITs, and other corporate borrowers with long-term borrowings. On the consolidated statements of operations, operating leases are expensed through operating lease rent while financing leases are expensed through amortization and interest expense. When applicable, the Company combines the consideration for lease and non-lease components in the calculation of the value of the lease obligation and right-of-use asset. 
 We incur a variety of costs in the development and leasing of our properties. After the determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. The costs of land and building under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include, but are not limited to, pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than after major construction activity ceases. We cease capitalization on the portions substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalize only those costs associated with the portions under construction.

 On a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indications that the value of our real estate properties may be impaired or that their carrying value may not be recoverable. A property's value is considered impaired if management's estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted) to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property as calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC 820. We also evaluate our real estate properties for impairment when a property has been classified as held for sale. Real estate assets held for sale are valued at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell and depreciation expense is no longer recorded. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020, we recognized million and million, respectively, of rental revenue for the amortization of aggregate below-market leases in excess of above-market leases resulting from the allocation of the purchase price of the applicable properties. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a reduction of rental revenue of million) for the amortization of aggregate above-market leases in excess of below-market leases.

 The cost basis of the commercial mortgage-backed securities was million and million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These securities mature at various times through 2030. All securities were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2022 with an unrealized loss of million and fair market value of million. The securities were in a continuous loss position for less than 12 months. All securities were in an unrealized gain position as of December 31, 2021 except for security, which had an unrealized loss of million and a fair market value of million, and was in a continuous unrealized loss position for more than 12 months. This marketable security was sold at par during the year ended December 31, 2022. We do not intend to sell our other securities, and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the investment before the recovery of their amortized cost basis. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we received aggregate net proceeds of million from the sale of debt marketable security and million from the repayment of debt marketable security. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we received aggregate net proceeds of million from the repayment of debt marketable security. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we did t dispose of any debt marketable securities. 
 We held equity marketable securities as of December 31, 2022 as we sold the equity marketable security that was held as of December 31, 2021 during the year ended December 31, 2022, for which we received aggregate net proceeds of million. We did t dispose of any equity marketable securities during the year ended December 31, 2021. We recognized million of realized losses and million of unrealized gains for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Any related unamortized deferred origination fees, original issue discounts, loan origination costs, discounts or premiums at the time of sale are recognized as an adjustment to the gain or loss on sale, which is included in investment income on the consolidated statement of operations. Any fees received at the time of sale or syndication are recognized as part of investment income. 
 Asset management fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the asset management agreement.

 We follow a two-step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions. Recognition (step one) occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (step two) determines the amount of benefit that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon settlement. Derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when a company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained. The use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions is prohibited.

 million in unsecured trust preferred securities through a newly formed trust, SL Green Capital Trust I, or the Trust, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership. The securities mature in 2035 and bear interest at a floating rate of basis points over the three-month LIBOR. Interest payments may be deferred for a period of up to consecutive quarters if the Operating Partnership exercises its right to defer such payments. The Trust preferred securities are redeemable at the option of the Operating Partnership, in whole or in part, with no prepayment premium. We do not consolidate the Trust even though it is a variable interest entity as we are not the primary beneficiary. Because the Trust is not consolidated, we have recorded the debt on our consolidated balance sheets and the related payments are classified as interest expense.

 One Vanderbilt Avenue Investment 
 In December 2016, we entered into agreements with entities owned and controlled by our Chairman and CEO, Marc Holliday, and our President, Andrew Mathias, pursuant to which they agreed to make an investment in our One Vanderbilt project (inclusive of the property and Summit One Vanderbilt) at the appraised fair market value for the interests acquired. This investment entitles these entities to receive approximately - and - , respectively, of any profits realized by the Company from its One Vanderbilt project in excess of the Company s capital contributions. The entities have no right to any return of capital. Accordingly, subject to previously disclosed repurchase rights, these interests will have no value and will not entitle these entities to any amounts (other than limited distributions to cover tax liabilities incurred) unless and until the Company has received distributions from the One Vanderbilt project in excess of the Company s aggregate investment in the project. In the event that the Company does not realize a profit on its investment in the project (or would not realize a profit based on the value at the time the interests are repurchased), the entities owned and controlled by Messrs. Holliday and Mathias will lose the entire amount of their investment. The entities owned and controlled by Messrs. Holliday and Mathias paid million and million, respectively, which equaled the fair market value of the interests acquired as of the date the investment agreements were entered into as determined by an independent third party appraisal that we obtained. 
 Messrs. Holliday and Mathias have the right to tender their interests in the project upon stabilization within after stabilization and or more after stabilization). In addition, the agreement calls for us to repurchase these interests in the event of a sale of One Vanderbilt or a transactional change of control of the Company. We also have the right to repurchase these interests on the anniversary of the stabilization of the project or upon the occurrence of certain separation events prior to the stabilization of the project relating to each of Messrs. Holliday s and Mathias s continued service with us. The price paid upon a tender of the interests will equal the liquidation value of the interests at the time, with the value being based on the project's sale price, if applicable, or fair market value as determined by an independent third party appraiser. In 2022, stabilization of the property (but not Summit One Vanderbilt) was achieved. Therefore, Messrs. Holiday and Mathias exercised their rights to tender of their interests in the property (but not Summit One Vanderbilt) for liquidation values of million and million, respectively, which were paid in July 2022.

 Earnings per Share 
 We use the two-class method of computing earnings per share EPS ), which is an earnings allocation formula that determines EPS for common stock and any participating securities according to dividends declared (whether paid or unpaid). Under the two-class method, basic EPS is computed by dividing the income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common stock shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur from share equivalent activity.

 general and limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership and Series I Preferred Units. Partnership interests in the Operating Partnership are denominated as common units of limited partnership interest (also referred to as OP Units or preferred units of limited partnership interest (also referred to as Preferred Units ). All references to OP Units and Preferred Units outstanding exclude such units held by the Company. A holder of an OP Unit may present such OP Unit to the Operating Partnership for redemption at any time (subject to restrictions agreed upon at the issuance of OP Units to particular holders that may restrict such right for a period of time, generally from issuance). Upon presentation of an OP Unit for redemption, the Operating Partnership must redeem such OP Unit in exchange for the cash equal to the then value of a share of common stock of the Company, except that the Company may, at its election, in lieu of cash redemption, acquire such OP Unit for share of common stock. Because the number of shares of common stock outstanding at all times equals the number of OP Units that the Company owns, share of common stock is generally the economic equivalent of OP Unit, and the quarterly distribution that may be paid to the holder of an OP Unit equals the quarterly dividend that may be paid to the holder of a share of common stock. Each series of Preferred Units makes a distribution that is set in accordance with an amendment to the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership. Preferred Units may also be convertible into OP Units at the election of the holder thereof or the Company, subject to the terms of such Preferred Units.

 fungible units may be granted under the 2005 Plan. Currently, different types of awards count against the limit on the number of fungible units differently, with (1) full-value awards (i.e., those that deliver the full value of the award upon vesting, such as restricted stock) counting as Fungible Units per share subject to such awards, (2) stock options, stock appreciation rights and other awards that do not deliver full value and expire from the date of grant counting as fungible units per share subject to such awards, and (3) all other awards (e.g., -year stock options) counting as fungible units per share subject to such awards. Awards granted under the 2005 Plan prior to the approval of the fifth amendment and restatement in June 2022 continue to count against the fungible unit limit based on the ratios that were in effect at the time such awards were granted, which may be different than the current ratios. As a result, depending on the types of awards issued, the 2005 Plan may result in the issuance of more or less than shares. If a stock option or other award granted under the 2005 Plan expires or terminates, the common stock subject to any portion of the award that expires or terminates without having been exercised or paid, as the case may be, will again become available for the issuance of additional awards. Shares of our common stock distributed under the 2005 Plan may be treasury shares or authorized but unissued shares. Currently, unless the 2005 Plan has been previously terminated by the Company's Board of Directors, new awards may be granted under the 2005 Plan until June 1, 2032, which is the tenth anniversary of the date that the 2005 Plan was most recently approved by the Company's stockholders. As of December 31, 2022, million fungible units were available for issuance under the 2005 Plan after reserving for shares underlying outstanding restricted stock units, phantom stock units granted pursuant to our Non-Employee Directors' Deferral Program and LTIP Units. 
 Stock Options and Class O LTIP Units 
 Options are granted with an exercise price at the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant and, subject to employment, generally expire or from the date of grant, are not transferable other than on death, and generally vest in to commencing from the date of grant. We have also granted Class O LTIP Units, which are a class of LTIP Units in the Operating Partnership structured to provide economics similar to those of stock options. Class O LTIP Units, once vested, may be converted, at the election of the holder, into a number of common units of the Operating Partnership per Class O LTIP Unit determined by the increase in value of a share of the Company s common stock at the time of conversion over a participation threshold, which equals the fair market value of a share of the Company s common stock at the time of grant. Class O LTIP Units are entitled to distributions, subject to vesting, equal per unit to of the per unit distributions paid with respect to the common units of the Operating Partnership. 
 The fair value of each stock option or LTIP Unit granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on historical information. There were options granted during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.

As of December 31, 2022, there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years. 
 We granted LTIP Units, which include bonus, time-based and performance-based awards, with a fair value of million and million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The grant date fair value of the LTIP Unit awards was calculated in accordance with ASC 718. A third-party consultant determined that the fair value of the LTIP Units has a discount to our common stock price. The discount was calculated by considering the inherent uncertainty that the LTIP Units will reach parity with other common partnership units and the illiquidity due to transfer restrictions. As of December 31, 2022, there was million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to the time-based and performance-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years. 
 During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we recorded compensation expense related to bonus, time-based and performance-based awards of million, million, and million, respectively.

 Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors 
 Under our Non-Employee Director's Deferral Program, which commenced July 2004, the Company's non-employee directors may elect to defer up to of their annual retainer fee, chairman fees, meeting fees and annual stock grant. Unless otherwise elected by a participant, fees deferred under the program shall be credited in the form of phantom stock units. The program provides that a director's phantom stock units generally will be settled in an equal number of shares of common stock upon the earlier of (i) the January 1 coincident with or the next following such director's termination of service from the Board of Directors or (ii) a change in control by us, as defined by the program. Phantom stock units are credited to each non-employee director quarterly using the closing price of our common stock on the first business day of the respective quarter. Each participating non-employee director is also credited with dividend equivalents or phantom stock units based on the dividend rate for each quarter, which are either paid in cash currently or credited to the director s account as additional phantom stock units. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, phantom stock units and shares of common stock were issued to our Board of Directors. We recorded compensation expense of million during the year ended December 31, 2022 related to the Deferred Compensation Plan. As of December 31, 2022, there were phantom stock units outstanding pursuant to our Non-Employee Director's Deferral Program.

 interest in its 220 East 42nd Street investment, which resulted in the Company no longer retaining a controlling interest in the entity, as defined in ASC 810, and the deconsolidation of the interest we retained. We recorded our investment at fair value which resulted in the recognition of a fair value adjustment of million during the year ended December 31, 2021. The fair value of our investment was determined by the terms of the joint venture agreement. 
 In January 2021, pursuant to the partnership documents of our 885 Third Ave investments, certain participating rights of the common member expired. As a result, it was determined that this investment is a VIE in which we are the primary beneficiary, and the investment was consolidated in our financial statements. Upon consolidating the entity, the assets and liabilities of the entity were recorded at fair value. This fair value was determined using a third-party valuation which primarily utilized cash flow projections that apply, among other things, estimated revenue and expense growth rates, discount rates and capitalization rates, as well as sales comparison approach, which utilizes comparable sales, listings and sales contracts. All of which are classified as Level 3 inputs. 
 Marketable securities classified as Level 1 are derived from quoted prices in active markets. The valuation technique used to measure the fair value of marketable securities classified as Level 2 were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using the significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We do not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases. 
 The fair value of derivative instruments is based on current market data received from financial sources that trade such instruments and are based on prevailing market data and derived from third party proprietary models based on well-recognized financial principles and reasonable estimates about relevant future market conditions, which are classified as Level 2 inputs. 
 The financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, debt and preferred equity investments, mortgages and other loans payable and other secured and unsecured debt. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses reported in our consolidated balance sheets approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value of debt and preferred equity investments, which is classified as Level 3, is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current interest rates at which similar loans with the same maturities would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings. The fair value of borrowings, which is classified as Level 3, is estimated by discounting the contractual cash flows of each debt instrument to their present value using adjusted market interest rates, which is provided by a third-party specialist.

 The Company frequently has agreements with each of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position, including accrued interest but excluding any adjustment for nonperformance risk related to these agreements was million. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was not required to post any collateral related to these agreements and was not in breach of any agreement provisions. If the Company had breached any of these provisions, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at their aggregate termination value of million as of December 31, 2022. 
 Gains and losses on terminated hedges are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and are recognized into earnings over the term of the related mortgage obligation. Over time, the realized and unrealized gains and losses held in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified into earnings as an adjustment to interest expense in the same periods in which the hedged interest payments affect earnings.

 Insurance 
 We maintain all-risk property and rental value coverage (including coverage regarding the perils of flood, earthquake and terrorism, excluding nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological terrorism ("NBCR"), within two property insurance programs and liability insurance. Separate property and liability coverage may be purchased on a stand-alone basis for certain assets, such as development projects. Additionally, one of our captive insurance companies, Belmont Insurance Company, or Belmont, provides coverage for NBCR terrorist acts above a specified trigger. Belmont's retention is reinsured by our other captive insurance company, Ticonderoga Insurance Company ("Ticonderoga"). If Belmont or Ticonderoga are required to pay a claim under our insurance policies, we would ultimately record the loss to the extent of required payments. However, there is no assurance that in the future we will be able to procure coverage at a reasonable cost. Further, if we experience losses that are uninsured or that exceed policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties. Additionally, our debt instruments contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance and we could default under our debt instruments if the cost and/or availability of certain types of insurance make it impractical or impossible to comply with such covenants relating to insurance. Belmont and Ticonderoga provide coverage solely on properties owned by the Company or its affiliates. 
 Furthermore, with respect to certain of our properties, including properties held by joint ventures or subject to triple net leases, insurance coverage is obtained by a third-party and we do not control the coverage. While we may have agreements with such third parties to maintain adequate coverage and we monitor these policies, such coverage ultimately may not be maintained or adequately cover our risk of loss. 
 Belmont had loss reserves of million and million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Ticonderoga had loss reserves as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 Lease Arrangements 
 We are a tenant under leases for certain properties, including ground leases. These leases have expirations from 2033 to 2119, or 2043 to 2119 as fully extended. Certain leases offer extension options which we assess against relevant economic factors to determine whether we are reasonably certain of exercising or not exercising the option. Lease payments associated with renewal periods that we are reasonably certain will be exercised, if any, are included in the measurement of the corresponding lease liability and right of use asset. 
 Certain of our leases are subject to rent resets, generally based on a percentage of the then fair market value, a fixed amount, or a percentage of the preceding rent at specified future dates. Rent resets will be recognized in the periods in which they are incurred. Additionally, certain of our leases are subject to percentage rent arrangements based on thresholds established in the lease agreement, such as percentage of sales at the property. Percentage rents will be recognized in the periods in which they are incurred.

 The primary sources of revenue are generated from tenant rents, escalations and reimbursement revenue.

 Interest costs for the debt and preferred equity segment include any actual costs incurred for borrowings on the 2017 MRA and the FHLB Facility. Interest is imputed on the investments that do not collateralize the 2017 MRA and the FHLB Facility using our weighted average corporate borrowing cost. We also allocate loan loss reserves, net of recoveries, and transaction related costs to the debt and preferred equity segment. We do not allocate marketing, general and administrative expenses to the debt and preferred equity segment because that segment does not have dedicated personnel and the use of personnel and resources is dependent on transaction volume between the segments, which varies between periods. In addition, we base performance on the individual segments prior to allocating marketing, general and administrative expenses. For the years ended, December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 marketing, general and administrative expenses totaled million, million, and million respectively. All other expenses, except interest, relate entirely to the real estate assets. 
 There were no transactions between the above two segments.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based closely on the definition of "disclosure controls and procedures" in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in our periodic reports. Also, the Company has investments in certain unconsolidated entities. As the Company does not control these entities, its disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those the Company maintains with respect to its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective to give reasonable assurances to the timely collection, evaluation and disclosure of information relating to the Company that would potentially be subject to disclosure under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 
 Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 The Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (COSO). Based on that evaluation, the Company concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Exhibit 4.11 
 DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT'S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 
 As of the date of our annual report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit is a part, we have the following classes of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act (1) our common stock, par value 0.01 per share and (2) our 6.500 Series I Redeemable Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value 0.01 per share. 
 DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK 
 The following description of the terms of SL Green's common stock is only a summary. This description is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, SL Green's charter and bylaws, each as amended, each of which has previously been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), and the Maryland General Corporation Law (the MGCL ). The terms we, us and our as such terms are used in the following description of common stock refer to SL Green Realty Corp. unless the context requires otherwise. 
 General 
 Our charter provides that we may issue up to 160,000,000 shares of common stock, 0.01 par value per share. Subject to the provisions of the charter regarding excess stock, each outstanding share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors, and, except as provided with respect to any other class or series of stock, the holders of this stock will possess the exclusive voting power. There is no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which means that the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock can elect all of the directors then standing for election and the holders of the remaining shares will not be able to elect any directors. As of February 15, 2023, 64,365,509 shares of SL Green Realty Corp.'s common stock, par value 0.01 per share, were outstanding. Company to provide updated share info. 
 All issued and outstanding shares of common stock are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. Subject to the preferential rights of any other shares or series of stock and to the provisions of the charter regarding excess stock, holders of shares of common stock are entitled to receive dividends on this stock if, as and when authorized by our board of directors out of assets legally available therefor and to share ratably in our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up after payment of or adequate provision for all of our known debts and liabilities. 
 Holders of shares of common stock have no preference, conversion, exchange, sinking fund, redemption or appraisal rights and have no preemptive rights to subscribe for any of our securities. Subject to the provisions of the charter regarding excess stock, shares of common stock will have equal dividend, liquidation and other rights. 
 Listing 
 Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE under the symbol SLG. 
 Certain Provisions of Our Charter and Bylaws 
 Our charter authorizes our board of directors to reclassify any unissued shares of common stock into other classes or series of stock and to establish the number of shares in each class or series and to set the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations and restrictions on ownership, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption for each class or series. 
 Our board of directors currently consists of ten directors, which number may be increased or decreased pursuant to our bylaws but shall never be less than the minimum number required by the Maryland General Corporation Law (which is one). Our directors are elected at each annual meeting of stockholders to serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. 
 Our charter also provides that, except for any directors who may be elected by holders of a class or series of capital stock other than our common stock, directors may be removed only for cause, as defined in our charter, and only by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast generally for the election of directors. Vacancies on the board of directors may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors. 

Our bylaws provide for the election of directors, in uncontested elections, by a majority of the votes cast. In contested elections, our bylaws provide for the election of directors by a plurality of the votes cast. 
 We have adopted a policy on majority voting in the election of directors in an uncontested election at a duly called meeting of stockholders. Pursuant to this policy, when a quorum is present, any nominee who fails to receive a majority of the votes cast for his or her election will, within ten business days following the certification of the stockholder vote, tender his or her written resignation to the Chairman of the Board for consideration by our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider the resignation and, within 60 days following the date of the stockholders' meeting at which the election occurred, will make a recommendation to our board of directors concerning the acceptance or rejection of the resignation. 
 Under the policy, our board of directors will take formal action on the recommendation no later than 90 days following the date of the stockholders' meeting. In considering the recommendation, our board of directors will consider the information, factors and alternatives considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and such additional factors, information and alternatives as the board of directors deems relevant. We will publicly disclose, in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC, the board of directors' decision within four business days after the decision is made. Our board of directors also will provide, if applicable, its reason or reasons for rejecting the tendered resignation. 
 Our bylaws permit any eligible stockholder or group of up to 20 stockholders who has owned continuously for at least three years (as determined in accordance with our bylaws) 3 or more of our outstanding common stock to include up to a specified number of director nominees in our proxy materials for an annual meeting of stockholders, provided that the stockholders and the nominees satisfy the requirements specified in our bylaws. The maximum number of stockholder nominees permitted under the proxy access provisions of our bylaws will not exceed the greater of (i) two or (ii) 20 of the number of directors in office as of the last day on which a notice of proxy access nomination may be timely received by us. If the 20 calculation does not result in a whole number, the maximum number of stockholder nominees is the closest whole number below 20 . The proxy access provisions of our bylaws require certain information and representations to be provided or made by nominating stockholders and contain certain other procedural provisions. In addition, our bylaws provide that all nominees for director must provide certain information, representations and agreements to us in order to be eligible for election or re-election as a director. 
 Our bylaws also permit our stockholders to alter or amend the bylaws or to adopt new bylaws. Specifically, Article XIV of the bylaws permits our stockholders to alter or amend the bylaws or to adopt new bylaws by the affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Our board of directors also has the ability to alter or amend the bylaws or to adopt new bylaws. 
 Restrictions on Ownership 
 For us to qualify as a real estate investment trust REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), not more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals, according to the definition in the Code, during the last half of a taxable year and our capital stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. To satisfy the above ownership requirements and other requirements for qualification as a REIT, our charter contains certain provisions restricting the ownership or acquisition of shares of our capital stock. These restrictions on ownership and acquisition of shares of our capital stock provide, among other things, that subject to certain exceptions, no stockholder may own, or be deemed to own by virtue of certain attribution provisions of the Code, more than 9.0 of the lesser of the aggregate number or value of our outstanding shares of common stock. 
 These restrictions will not preclude settlement of transactions through the NYSE. 
 Transfer Agent and Registrar 
 The transfer agent and registrar for the common stock is Computershare Shareowner Services LLC. 
 Certain Anti-Takeover Provisions of Maryland Law 
 Business Combinations 
 Under the MGCL, certain business combinations (including a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in certain circumstances, an asset transfer or issuance or transfer of equity securities or reclassification of equity securities) between a Maryland corporation and any person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10 or more of the voting power of the corporation or an affiliate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in 

question, was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10 or more of the voting power of the then-outstanding voting stock of the corporation, in each case referred to as an interested stockholder, or an affiliate of such an interested stockholder, are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Thereafter, any such business combination must be recommended by the board of directors of such corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least (a) 80 of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation and (b) two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation other than shares of voting stock held by the interested stockholder with whom (or with whose affiliate) the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder, unless, among other conditions, the corporation's common stockholders receive a minimum price (as defined in the MGCL) for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares. These provisions of the MGCL do not apply, however, to business combinations that are approved or exempted by a board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. A person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested stockholder. 
 Our board of directors may provide that its approval is subject to compliance with any terms and conditions determined by it. However, pursuant to the statute, our board of directors has by resolution opted out of these provisions of the MGCL and, consequently, the five-year prohibition and the super-majority vote requirements will not apply to business combinations between us and any interested stockholder of our company. As a result, anyone who later becomes an interested stockholder may be able to enter into business combinations with us that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders without compliance by our company with the super-majority vote requirements and the other provisions of the statute. However, no assurances can be given that such resolution will not be modified, amended or revoked in the future or that the provisions of the MGCL relative to business combinations will not be reinstated or again become applicable to us. 
 Control Share Acquisitions 
 The MGCL provides that holders of control shares of a Maryland corporation acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights with respect to the control shares except to the extent approved at a special meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding shares of stock in a corporation in respect of which any of the following persons is entitled to exercise or direct the exercise of the voting power of shares of stock of the corporation in the election of directors (i) a person who makes or proposes to make a control share acquisition, (ii) an officer of the corporation or (iii) an employee of the corporation who is also a director of the corporation. Control shares are voting shares of stock which, if aggregated with all other such shares of stock owned by the acquiror or in respect of which the acquiror is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquiror, directly or indirectly, to exercise or direct the exercise of, voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of voting power (i) one-tenth or more but less than one-third, (ii) one-third or more but less than a majority, or (iii) a majority or more of all voting power. Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval. A control share acquisition means the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of control shares, subject to certain exceptions. 
 A person who has made or proposes to make a control share acquisition, upon satisfaction of certain conditions (including an undertaking to pay expenses), may compel our board of directors to call a special meeting of stockholders to be held within 50 days of demand to consider the voting rights of the shares. If no request for a meeting is made, the corporation may itself present the question at any stockholders meeting. 
 If voting rights are not approved at the meeting or if the acquiring person does not deliver an acquiring person statement as required by the statute, then, subject to certain conditions and limitations, the corporation may redeem any or all of the control shares (except those for which voting rights have previously been approved) for fair value determined, without regard to the absence of voting rights for the control shares, as of the date of the last control share acquisition by the acquiror or of any meeting of stockholders at which the voting rights of such shares are considered and not approved. If voting rights for control shares are approved at a stockholders meeting and the acquiror becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares entitled to vote, all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights. The fair value of the shares as determined for purposes of such appraisal rights may not be less than the highest price per share paid by the acquiror in the control share acquisition. 
 The control share acquisition statute does not apply (a) to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if the corporation is a party to the transaction or (b) to acquisitions approved or exempted by the charter or bylaws of the corporation. 
 Our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the control share acquisition statute any and all acquisitions by any person of shares of our stock. There can be no assurance that this provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future. 

Subtitle 8 
 Subtitle 8 of Title 3 of the MGCL permits a Maryland corporation with a class of equity securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and at least three independent directors to elect to be subject, by provision in its charter or bylaws or a resolution of its board of directors and notwithstanding any contrary provision in the charter or bylaws, to any or all of the following five provisions 
 a classified board 
 a two-thirds vote requirement for removing a director 
 a requirement that the number of directors be fixed only by vote of the directors 
 a requirement that a vacancy on the board be filled only by the remaining directors and for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred and 
 a majority requirement for the calling of a special meeting of stockholders. 
 Our bylaws provide, and we have elected to be subject to the provision of Subtitle 8 that requires, that a vacancy on the board be filled only by the remaining directors and for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred. Through provisions in our charter and bylaws unrelated to Subtitle 8, we also vest in the board the exclusive power to fix the number of directorships. If we made an election to be subject to the provision of Subtitle 8 relating to a classified board, our board of directors would automatically be classified into three classes with staggered terms of office of three years each. In such instance, the classification and staggered terms of office of the directors would make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of the board of directors since at least two annual meetings of stockholders, instead of one, generally would be required to effect a change in the majority of the board of directors. 
 Anti-Takeover Effect of Certain Provisions of Maryland Law 
 The business combination provisions, the control share acquisition provisions and Subtitle 8 of the MGCL, and certain other provisions of our charter and bylaws, could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for holders of securities or otherwise be in their best interests. 

DESCRIPTION OF SERIES I PREFERRED STOCK 
 The following is a summary of certain general terms of our preferred stock and certain provisions of the articles supplementary creating our Series I Preferred Stock. This description is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to SL Green's charter, which includes the articles supplementary relating to each series of preferred stock, and SL Green's bylaws, as amended, each of which has previously been filed with the SEC, and the MGCL. As used in this section, the terms we, us or our refer to SL Green Realty Corp. and not any of its subsidiaries. 
 General 
 Our charter provides that we may issue up to 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, 0.01 par value per share which may be classified and designated in one or more series by our board of directors. As of December 31, 2022, there were 9,200,000 shares of preferred stock outstanding, consisting of shares of 6.50 Series I Preferred Stock. Company to provide updated share amounts. 
 The issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power, dividend rights and other rights of holders of common stock. Our board of directors could establish another series of preferred stock that could, depending on the terms of the series, delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the holders thereof. Management believes that the availability of preferred stock will provide us with increased flexibility in structuring possible future financings and acquisitions and in meeting other needs that might arise. 
 Listing 
 The Series I Preferred Stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol SLG.PRI. 
 Maturity 
 The Series I Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption. Shares of the Series I Preferred Stock will remain outstanding indefinitely unless we decide to redeem or otherwise repurchase them. We are not required to set aside funds to redeem the Series I Preferred Stock. 
 Ranking 
 The Series I Preferred Stock, with respect to rights to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, ranks (a) senior to our common stock and all other classes or series of our capital stock issued in the future, the terms of which specifically provide that such class or series of capital stock ranks junior to the Series I Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, (b) on a parity with all other classes or series of our capital stock issued in the future, other than those referred to in clauses (a) and (c), the terms of which specifically provide that such classes or series of capital stock rank on a parity with the Series I Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and (c) junior to all other classes or series of our capital stock issued in the future, the terms of which specifically provide that such classes or series of capital stock rank senior to the Series I Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up. 
 Dividends 
 Subject to the preferential rights of holders of any class or series of our capital stock ranking senior to the Series I Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends, holders of Series I Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, if and as declared by our board of directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of quarterly cumulative preferential cash dividends, an amount per share equal to 6.50 of the 25.00 liquidation preference per annum (equivalent to a fixed annual amount of 1.625 per share), payable in equal amounts of 0.40625 per share quarterly. Dividends on the Series I Preferred Stock began to accrue and were fully cumulative starting from, and including, August 10, 2012 and are payable quarterly when, if and as authorized by our board of directors, in equal amounts in arrears on the fifteenth day of each January, April, July and October or, if not a business day, then the next succeeding business day (each, a Dividend Payment Date ), and no interest or additional dividends or other sums will accrue on the amount so payable from the Dividend Payment Date to such next succeeding business day. Any dividend payable on the Series I Preferred Stock for any portion of a dividend period that ends prior to a Dividend Payment Date will be prorated and computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dividends are payable to holders of record as they appear in our stock records at the close of business on the applicable 

record date, which is the first day of the calendar month in which the applicable Dividend Payment Date falls or such other date designated by our board of directors that is not more than 30 nor less than 10 days prior to such Dividend Payment Date (each, a Dividend Record Date ). Each outstanding share of Series I Preferred Stock is entitled to receive a dividend with respect to any Dividend Record Rate equal to the dividend paid with respect to each other share of Series I Preferred Stock that is outstanding on such Dividend Record Date. 
 No dividend on the Series I Preferred Stock can be declared or paid or set apart for payment by our board of directors if such declaration, payment or setting apart for payment would violate any of our agreements or is restricted or prohibited by law. 
 In the event dividends are not paid in full (or a sum sufficient for such full payment is not so set apart) upon the Series I Preferred Stock and the shares of any other class or series of our capital stock ranking on a parity as to the payment of dividends with the Series I Preferred Stock, all dividends declared upon the Series I Preferred Stock and any other class or series of capital stock ranking on a parity as to the payment of dividends with the Series I Preferred Stock are declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share of Series I Preferred Stock and such other class or series of our capital stock will in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accumulated dividends per share on the Series I Preferred Stock and such other class or series of capital stock (which will not include any accumulation in respect of unpaid dividends for prior dividend periods if such class or series of our capital stock does not have a cumulative dividend) bear to each other. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, is payable in respect of any dividend payment or payments on the Series I Preferred Stock which may be in arrears. 
 Except as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph, unless full cumulative dividends on the Series I Preferred Stock and any other class or series of capital stock ranking on a parity as to the payment of dividends with the Series I Preferred Stock have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment for all past dividend periods 
 no dividends will be declared or paid or set apart for payment and no other distribution of cash or other property will be declared or made (other than in shares of our common stock or other class or series of capital stock ranking on a parity with or junior to the Series I Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up) on or with respect to any shares of our common stock or shares of any other class or series of our capital stock ranking, as to the payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, on a parity with or junior to the Series I Preferred Stock and 
 no common stock or any other class or series of capital stock ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series I Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up will be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any money paid or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such class or series of capital stock) by us (except by conversion into or exchange for any other class or series of our capital stock ranking on a parity with or junior to the Series I Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up or by redemption, purchase or acquisition for the purpose of maintaining our qualification as a REIT). 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, dividends on the Series I Preferred Stock accumulate whether or not the Company has earnings, whether or not there are funds legally available for the payment thereof, whether or not they are prohibited by the terms of the Company's or its subsidiaries' agreements and whether or not such dividends are declared. Accumulated but unpaid dividends on the Series I Preferred Stock do not bear interest and holders of the Series I Preferred Stock are not be entitled to any dividends in excess of full cumulative dividends as described above. 
 Holders of Series I Preferred Stock are not entitled to any dividend or other distribution, whether payable in cash, property or shares of any class or series of capital stock (including Series I Preferred Stock) in excess of the full cumulative dividends on the Series I Preferred Stock as described above. Any dividend payment made on the Series I Preferred Stock is first credited against the earliest accumulated but unpaid dividend due with respect to such shares which remain payable. 
 Liquidation Preference 
 In the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of the Series I Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive out of our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders remaining after payment or provisions for payment of all of our debts and other liabilities, liquidating distributions, in cash or property at its fair market value as determined by our board of directors, in the amount of a liquidation preference of 25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to any accumulated dividends (whether or not earned or declared) to, but not including, the date of payment, before any 

distribution of assets is made to holders of common stock or any other class or series of our capital stock ranking junior to the Series I Preferred Stock as to the distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, but subject to the preferential rights of the holders of shares of any class or series of our capital stock ranking senior to the Series I Preferred Stock as to the distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up. After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distributions to which they are entitled, the holders of Series I Preferred Stock will have no right or claim to any of our remaining assets. None of (i) our consolidation or merger with or into another entity, (ii) a merger of another entity with or into us, (iii) a statutory stock exchange by us or (iv) a sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of our property or business will be considered a liquidation, dissolution or winding up. If, upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders are insufficient to make the full payment due to holders of the Series I Preferred Stock and the corresponding amounts payable on all outstanding shares of other classes or series of capital stock ranking on a parity with the Series I Preferred Stock as to the distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, then the holders of the Series I Preferred Stock and all other such classes or series of capital stock will share ratably in any such distribution of assets in proportion to the full liquidating distributions (including, if applicable, accumulated and accrued dividends) to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled. The liquidation preference of the outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock will not be added to our liabilities for the purpose of determining whether under the MGCL a distribution may be made to our stockholders whose preferential rights upon our dissolution are junior to those of holders of the Series I Preferred Stock. 
 Redemption 
 The Series I Preferred Stock is not redeemable at any time at the option of the holders thereof. The Series I Preferred Stock will not be subject to sinking fund or mandatory redemption. Since August 10, 2017, we have had the option to redeem the Series I Preferred Stock at any time, in whole or from time to time in part, at a redemption price per share of Series I Preferred Stock in cash equal to 25.00, plus (except as provided below) all dividends accumulated and unpaid (whether or not earned or authorized) on the shares of Series I Preferred Stock to, but excluding, the date of such redemption, upon giving notice as provided below. Any date fixed for redemption pursuant to the foregoing provisions is referred to as a Series I Preferred Stock Redemption Date. 
 In the event of any redemption, we will provide notice by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of New York, such publication to be made once a week for two successive weeks commencing not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Series I Preferred Stock Redemption Date. We will deliver, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Series I Preferred Stock Redemption Date, to each holder of record of Series I Preferred Stock to be redeemed at such holder's address as it appears on our stock transfer records, notifying such holder of our election to redeem such shares provided that if we have reasonably concluded, based upon the advice of independent tax counsel experienced in such matters, that any redemption must be made on a date (the Subject Date which is earlier than 30 days after the date of such mailing in order to preserve our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes or to comply with federal tax laws relating to our qualification as a REIT, then we may give such shorter notice as is necessary to effect such redemption on the Subject Date. In addition to any information required by law or by the applicable rules of any exchange upon which the Series I Preferred Stock may be listed or admitted to trading, the notice of redemption will state (i) the date fixed for redemption thereof, (ii) the cash redemption price, (iii) the number of shares to be redeemed (and, if fewer than all the shares of Series I Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the number of shares to be redeemed from such holder), (iv) the place(s) where the certificates for the shares of Series I Preferred Stock, if any, are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price in cash, and (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease to accumulate on such redemption date. 
 If we redeem fewer than all of the outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock, the number of shares of Series I Preferred Stock to be redeemed will be determined by our board of directors and the shares to be redeemed will be selected by our board of directors pro rata or by lot or in such other equitable manner as determined by our board of directors. If such redemption is to be by lot and as a result of such redemption any holder of Series I Preferred Stock would become a holder of a number of shares of Series I Preferred Stock in excess of the Ownership Limit described herein because such holder's shares of Series I Preferred Stock were not redeemed, or were only redeemed in part, then, except in certain instances, we will redeem the requisite number of shares of Series I Preferred Stock from such holder such that he will not hold in excess of the Ownership Limit subsequent to such redemption. In addition, we may redeem shares of Series I Preferred Stock in certain circumstances relating to the maintenance of our ability to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. 
 On or after the Series I Preferred Stock Redemption Date, each holder of shares of Series I Preferred Stock to be redeemed must present and surrender the certificates, if any, representing his shares of Series I Preferred Stock to us at the place designated in the applicable notice of redemption and thereupon the cash redemption price of such shares will be paid to or on the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate representing shares of Series I Preferred Stock as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate will be canceled. If fewer than all the shares represented by any such certificate 

representing shares of Series I Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, a new certificate will be issued representing the unredeemed shares. If notice of redemption has been mailed or published in accordance with notice provisions described above and if the funds necessary for such redemption have been set aside by us in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Series I Preferred Stock so called for redemption, then from and after the Series I Preferred Stock Redemption Date (unless we default in payment of the redemption price), all dividends on the shares of Series I Preferred Stock called for redemption will cease to accumulate and all rights of the holders thereof, except the right to receive the redemption price thereof (including all accumulated and unpaid dividends to the Series I Preferred Stock Redemption Date), will cease and terminate and such shares will not thereafter be transferred (except with our consent) on our books, and such shares shall not be deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever. At our election, prior to a Series I Preferred Stock Redemption Date, we may irrevocably deposit the redemption price (including accumulated and unpaid dividends) of the Series I Preferred Stock so called for redemption in trust for the holders thereof with a bank or trust company, in which case the notice to holders of the Series I Preferred Stock to be redeemed will (i) state the date of such deposit, (ii) specify the office of such bank or trust company as the place of payment of the redemption price and (iii) require such holders to surrender the certificates representing such shares, if any, at such place on or about the date fixed in such redemption notice (which may not be later than such Series I Preferred Stock Redemption Date) against payment of the redemption price (including all accumulated and unpaid dividends to such Series I Preferred Stock Redemption Date). Any interest or other earnings earned on the redemption price (including all accumulated and unpaid dividends) deposited with a bank or trust company will be paid to us. Any moneys so deposited which remain unclaimed by the holders of the shares of Series I Preferred Stock at the end of two years after the Series I Preferred Stock Redemption Date will be returned to us by such bank or trust company. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless full cumulative dividends on all shares of Series I Preferred Stock have been or contemporaneously are authorized, declared and paid or authorized, declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment for all past dividend periods, no shares of Series I Preferred Stock will be redeemed unless all outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock are simultaneously redeemed or exchanged provided, however, that the foregoing will not prevent the purchase or acquisition of shares of Series I Preferred Stock pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock. In addition, unless full cumulative dividends on all outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment for all past dividend periods, we will not purchase or otherwise acquire directly or indirectly any shares of Series I Preferred Stock or any shares of any other class or series of our capital stock ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series I Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends or the distribution of our assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up (except by conversion into or exchange for shares of any class or series of our capital stock ranking junior to the Series I Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends or the distribution of our assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up or by redemptions for the purposes of maintaining our qualification as a REIT). 
 Immediately prior to any redemption of shares of Series I Preferred Stock, we shall pay, in cash, any accumulated and unpaid dividends to but not including the Series I Preferred Stock Redemption Date, unless such Series I Preferred Stock Redemption Date falls after a Dividend Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date, in which case each holder of Series I Preferred Stock at the close of business on such Dividend Record Date shall be entitled to receive the dividend payable on such shares on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the redemption of such shares on or prior to such Dividend Payment Date. Except as provided above, we will make no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, on shares of Series I Preferred Stock for which a notice of redemption has been given. 
 Any shares of Series I Preferred Stock that we redeem will, after such redemption, have the status of authorized but unissued preferred stock, without designation as to class or series until such shares are once more designated as part of a particular class or series by our board of directors. 
 Conversion 
 Shares of Series I Preferred Stock are not convertible into, or exchangeable for, any of our other property or securities. 
 Voting Rights 
 Holders of Series I Preferred Stock do not have any voting rights, except as described below. Whenever dividends on any shares of Series I Preferred Stock are in arrears for six or more quarterly periods, whether or not such quarterly periods are consecutive, the number of directors then constituting the board will increase by two (if not already increased by reason of a similar arrearage with respect to any parity voting preferred stock) and the holders of Series I Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class with all other classes or series of our capital stock ranking on a parity with the Series I Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation dissolution or winding up 

upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) will be entitled to vote for the election of two additional directors who will each be elected for a one-year term. Such election will be held at a special meeting of the stockholders or, in certain circumstances, at the next annual meeting of stockholders and at each subsequent annual meeting until all arrearages and the dividends on the Series I Preferred Stock and such other series of preferred stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable for the then current dividend period have been fully paid or have been declared and a sum sufficient for the full payment thereof has been set aside. Vacancies for directors elected by holders of Series I Preferred Stock and any other such series of preferred stock will be filled by the remaining director so elected then in office or, if there is no such remaining director, by vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock, when they are entitled to the voting rights described above, and any other such series of preferred stock voting as a single class. A director elected by the holders of Series I Preferred Stock and any other such series of preferred stock may be removed with or without cause and only by vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock, when they are entitled to the voting rights described above, and any other such series of preferred stock voting as a single class. 
 So long as any shares of Series I Preferred Stock remain outstanding, we will not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of Series I Preferred Stock outstanding at the time, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting (voting together as a single class with all other classes or series of our capital stock ranking on a parity with the Series I Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation dissolution or winding up upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable), (i) authorize, create or issue, or increase the authorized or issued amount of, any class or series of our capital stock ranking senior to the Series I Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or reclassify any authorized shares of our capital stock into any such class or series of our capital stock, or create, authorize or issue any obligation or security convertible or exchangeable into or evidencing the right to purchase any such class or series of our capital stock or (ii) amend, alter or repeal the provisions of our charter (including the articles supplementary relating to the Series I Preferred Stock), whether by merger or consolidation or otherwise (an Event ), so as to materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting power of such Series I Preferred Stock or the holders thereof provided, however, with respect to the occurrence of any of the Events set forth in (ii) above, so long as shares of Series I Preferred Stock remain outstanding or are converted into like securities of the surviving or resulting entity, in each case with like preference, privilege or voting power and terms thereof materially unchanged, taking into account that upon the occurrence of an Event, we may not be the surviving entity and such surviving entity may be a non-corporate entity, the occurrence of any such Event will not be deemed to materially adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of holders of Series I Preferred Stock and provided further that (x) any increase in the amount of the authorized preferred stock or the creation or issuance of any other series of preferred stock, or (y) the creation, issuance or increase in the amount of authorized shares of any other class or series of our capital stock, or (z) any increase in the amount of authorized shares of Series I Preferred Stock, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to the Series I Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, will not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, holders of any parity preferred stock are not entitled to vote together as a class with the holders of Series I Preferred Stock on any amendment, alteration or repeal of our charter if holders of Series I Preferred Stock are affected unequally by such amendment. 
 Holders of shares of Series I Preferred Stock are not entitled to vote with respect to any increase in total number of authorized shares of our common stock or preferred stock, any increase in the amount of the authorized Series I Preferred Stock or the creation or issuance of any other class or series of capital stock, or any increase in the number of authorized shares of Series I Preferred Stock or any other class or series of capital stock, in each case ranking on a parity with or junior to the Series I Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. 
 In addition, the holders of such Series I Preferred Stock do not have any voting rights with respect to, and the consent of the holders of Series I Preferred Stock is not required for, the taking of any corporate action, including any merger or consolidation involving us or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, regardless of the effect that such merger, consolidation or sale may have upon the powers, preferences, voting power or other rights or privileges of the Series I Preferred Stock, except as set forth in part (ii) of the second preceding paragraph. Except as expressly set forth in the articles supplementary relating to the Series I Preferred Stock, the Series I Preferred Stock does not have any relative, participatory, optional or other special voting rights and powers. 
 The foregoing voting provisions do not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be required will be effected, all outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock have been redeemed or called for redemption and sufficient funds shall have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption. 

In any matter in which the Series I Preferred Stock may vote (as expressly provided in the articles supplementary relating to the Series I Preferred Stock), each share of the Series I Preferred Stock is entitled to one vote, except that when any other class or series of our preferred stock has the right to vote with the Series I Preferred Stock as a single class on any matter, the Series I Preferred Stock and such other class or series will have with respect to such matters one vote per each 25.00 of stated liquidation preference. 
 Information Rights 
 During any period in which we are not subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and any Series I Preferred Stock is outstanding, we will (a) transmit by mail or other permissible means under the Exchange Act to all holders of Series I Preferred Stock as their names and addresses appear in our record books and without cost to such holders, copies of reports that are substantially similar to the Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q that we would have been required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act if we were subject thereto (other than any exhibits that would have been required) and (b) within 15 days following written request, supply copies of such reports to any prospective holder of the Series I Preferred Stock. We will mail (or otherwise provide) the reports to the holders of Series I Preferred Stock within 15 days after the respective dates by which we would have been required to file such reports with the SEC if we were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, based on the dates on which we would be required to file such periodic reports if we were a non-accelerated filer within the meaning of the Exchange Act. 
 Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer 
 For us to qualify as a REIT under the Code, not more than 50 in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals, according to the definition in the Code, during the last half of a taxable year and our capital stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. To satisfy the above ownership requirements and other requirements for qualification as a REIT, our charter contains certain provisions restricting the ownership or acquisition of shares of our capital stock. In addition, further restrictions were adopted prior to the issuance of the Series I Preferred Stock. The articles supplementary classifying the Series I Preferred Stock provide that no holder of Series I Preferred Stock may own, or be deemed to own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Code, nor may any person or entity acquire shares of our Series I Preferred Stock such that he or it would own in excess of 20 (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of Series I Preferred Stock. 
 These restrictions will not preclude settlement of transactions through the NYSE.
