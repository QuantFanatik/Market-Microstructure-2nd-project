SPECIAL
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, or the
Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. The statements contained in this report
that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements
regarding our or our management s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future. In addition, any
statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying
assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words anticipates, believe, continue, could, 
 estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, possible, 
 potential, predict, project, should, would and similar expressions
may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking
statements in this report may include, for example, statements about our: 

ability
 to complete our initial business combination; 

success
 in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or directors
 following our initial business combination; 

officers
 and directors allocating their time to other businesses and potentially having conflicts
 of interest with our business or in approving our initial business combination, as a result
 of which they would then receive expense reimbursements; 

potential
 ability to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination; 

pool
 of prospective target businesses; 

the
 ability of our officers and directors to generate a number of potential investment opportunities; 

potential
 change in control if we acquire one or more target businesses for stock; 

the
 potential liquidity and trading of our securities; 

the
 lack of a market for our securities; 

use
 of proceeds not held in the trust account or available to us from interest income on the
 trust account balance; or 

financial
 performance following our IPO. 

The
forward-looking statements contained in this report are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments
and their potential effects on us. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated.
These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions
that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described under the heading Risk Factors. 
Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may
vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable
securities laws and/or if and when management knows or has a reasonable basis on which to conclude that previously disclosed projections
are no longer reasonably attainable.

ITEM
1. BUSINESS 

Introduction 

We
are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition,
share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to herein as our
initial business combination. Our Sponsor is Mehana Capital LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Sponsor ). 

We
believe that there are many target companies that could become attractive public companies and we will seek a target in the disruptive
technology sector with a spotlight on companies in Asia with Japan in particular. While we may pursue an initial business combination
target in any industry or geographic region, we will seek to capitalize on the operational and investment experience of our management
team and focus on disruptive technology companies that we believe have significant growth prospects and the potential to generate attractive
returns for our stockholders. We expect to focus on identifying potential target companies with above-industry-average growth, and a
defensible market position where our management team s operational, strategic, or managerial expertise can assist in maximizing
value. 

The
Registration Statement for our initial public offering was declared effective on August 4, 2022 (the Initial Public Offering, 
or IPO ). On August 9, 2022, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 11,500,000 Units, including 1,500,000 Units issued
pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option in full, generating gross proceeds of 115,000,000. Each Unit
consists of one share of Class A common stock and one redeemable warrant Public Warrant ). Each Public Warrant entitles
the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of 11.50 per whole share. 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 634,375 units (the Placement Units at a price
of 10.00 per Placement Unit in a private placement to the Sponsor, including 63,000 Placement Units issued pursuant to the exercise
of the underwriters over-allotment option in full, generating gross proceeds of 6,343,750, which is described in Note 4. 

Following
the closing of the Initial Public Offering on August 9, 2022, an amount of 117,875,000 10.25 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the
sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Placement Units was placed in a trust account (the Trust
Account ), and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with maturities of 185 days or less or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds held in the Trust
Account, as described below. 

We
will have until 9 months (or up to 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering at our election pursuant to nine one month
extensions subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including the deposit of 379,500 0.033 per unit) for such one month extension,
into the Trust Account, or as extended by our stockholders in accordance with our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation)
from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to consummate a business combination (the Combination Period ). If we are
unable to complete a business combination within the Combination Period, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding
up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100 of the outstanding Public Shares,
at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned
(net of taxes payable and less interest to pay dissolution expenses up to 100,000), divided by the number of then outstanding Public
Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive
further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption,
subject to the approval of the remaining stockholders and our board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby
a formal dissolution of the Company, subject in each case to its obligations to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements
of applicable law. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to the deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account
in the event we do not complete a business combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included
with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution,
it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering
price per Unit 10.00). 

4 

On
January 31, 2023, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement ), by and among us, Pono Two Merger
Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary Merger Sub ), SBC Medical Group Holdings Incorporated,
a Delaware corporation SBC ), Mehana Capital, LLC, in its capacity as Purchaser Representative, and Yoshiyuki Aikawa, in
his capacity as Seller Representative. 

Pursuant
to the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into
SBC, with SBC continuing as the surviving corporation. The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are referred to herein as
the Business Combination. 

As
a condition to closing of the Business Combination, SBC will complete certain restructuring transactions pursuant to which SBC Medical
Group Co., Ltd., a Japanese corporation SBC-Japan and certain related entities which carry on the business of SBC-Japan
and such other related entities, will become subsidiaries of SBC. 

As
consideration for the Business Combination, the holders of SBC securities as of the closing of the Business Combination, collectively
will be entitled to receive from us, in the aggregate, a number of our securities with an aggregate value equal to (a) 1,200,000,000,
minus (b) the amount, if any, by which 3,000,000 exceeds SBC s Net Working Capital, plus (c) the amount, if any, by which SBC s
Net Working Capital exceeds 3,000,000, minus (d) the aggregate amount of any outstanding indebtedness (minus cash held by SBC) of SBC
at Closing, minus (e) specified transaction expenses of SBC associated with the Business Combination. 

Please
see the Current Report on Form 8-K we filed with the SEC on February 2, 2023 for additional information. 

Our
Company 

We
are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on March 11, 2022 formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share
exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (a
 business combination ). We intend to effectuate
our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement
units, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the shares issued to
the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing or
other sources. 

We
believe that there are many target companies that could become attractive public companies and we will seek a target in the disruptive
technology sector with a spotlight on companies in Asia with Japan in particular. While we may pursue an initial business combination
target in any industry or geographic region, we will seek to capitalize on the operational and investment experience of our management
team and focus on disruptive technology companies that we believe have significant growth prospects and the potential to generate attractive
returns for our stockholders. We expect to focus on identifying potential target companies with above-industry-average growth, and a
defensible market position where our management team s operational, strategic, or managerial expertise can assist in maximizing
value. 

We
believe the traditional IPO and direct listing processes are not designed for these types of companies to execute on their ambitious
strategies. We believe using a SPAC structure is a disruptive alternative to, and creates more efficiencies than, the traditional IPO
approach. We also believe that because the industries in which we have particular expertise, and in which we will seek to identify a
potential business combination target, are often overlooked by traditional venture capital, public equity and private equity investors,
many high-quality companies in these industries are not well suited to a traditional IPO, direct listing or private equity buyout transaction.
Therefore, we believe our focus on these particular industries will provide unique access to the highest quality companies and management
teams and a substantial number of proprietary business combination opportunities. Our mission is to create a better solution to the conventional
IPO for these high growth, disruptive technology and technology-enabled companies, which addresses their needs for capital and liquidity,
while overcoming the key points of friction in the traditional IPO path in particular for businesses in Japan. 

5 

We
believe our expertise will make us an attractive partner for companies seeking a clear and efficient path to listing their shares with
a significant degree of funding certainty including high-quality companies in Japan where certain of the Company s officers and
directors are familiar with Japanese business and M A culture, which will have an impact on the dynamics of a business combination.
There are a large number of companies that desire to have publicly-traded shares to provide liquidity to investors and employees, create
a currency for mergers and acquisitions and access to equity capital markets. We may seek to combine with businesses owned by our founder
and minority investors, although we may consummate a transaction with businesses controlled by private equity investors or family-owned
businesses, which means there is a wide universe of potential partners. We believe our understanding of private deal execution and public
capital markets, and valuation dynamics in both markets, make us uniquely positioned to identify and execute a business combination with
a growth orientation. 

Our
Management Team 

Our
management team is led by Darryl Nakamoto, our Chief Executive Officer and Director, Allison Van Orman, our Chief Financial Officer,
and Dustin Shindo, our Chairman of the Board, who will be supported by Pono Capital Two, Inc. s independent directors, sponsor,
accountants and legal counsel, as further described below. We believe our management team is well positioned to identify and evaluate
businesses within the technology industry that would benefit from being a public company and from access to our expertise. We believe
we can achieve this mission by utilizing our team s extensive experience in growing and operating technology companies as well
as our broad network of contacts in the technology sector. 

Competition 

In
identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter competition from other
entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout
funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established
and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these
competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses
will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial business
combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their
redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the
future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place
us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 

Employees 

We
currently have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but
they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination.
The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial
business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees
prior to the completion of our initial business combination. 

For
additional discussion of the general development of our business, see our final prospectus on Form 424B4, filed with the SEC on August
8, 2022.

combination will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. It is the present intention of our board of directors

of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing or other sources. 

Results
of Operations 

We
have neither engaged in a ny operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities
 for the period from March 11, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare
for the Initial Public Offering, described below, and, after our Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for a business
combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial business combination. We will
generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. We incur expenses
as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence
expenses. 

For
the period from March 11, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022 , we had net income
 of 552,813, which resulted from interest and dividend income on investments held in the Trust
Account for 1,345,016, partially offset by operating and formation costs of 382,051, franchise tax expense of 161,644, and income
tax expense of 248,508.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

For
the period from March 11, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022 , net cash used in operating
activities was 462,816, which was due to interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 1,345,016, offset by
net income of 552,813 and a change in operating assets and liabilities of 329,387. 

For
the period from March 11, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022, net cash used in investing activities was 117,875,000 which was
primarily due to the investment of cash in the Trust Account. 

For
the period from March 11, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022 , net cash provided by financing
activities was 118,823,380, which was due to the proceeds from the sale of Units (as defined below) (net of the underwriting discount)
of 113,045,000, proceeds from the sale of Placement Units (as defined below) of 6,343,750, and proceeds from the issuance of Class
B common stock to the Sponsor of 25,000, offset in part by payment of offering costs of 590,370. 

The
registration statement for the Company s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on August 4, 2022. On August 9, 2022, the
Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 11,500,000 units, (the Units and, with respect to the shares of Class
A common stock included in the Units sold, the Public Shares ), including 1,500,000 Units issued pursuant to the exercise
of the underwriters over-allotment option in full, generating gross proceeds of 115,000,000. 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 634,375 units (the Placement
Units at a price of 10.00 per Placement Unit in a private placement to Mehana Capital
LLC (the Sponsor ), including 63,000 Placement Units issued
pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option in full, generating gross proceeds of 6,343,750. 

Following
the closing of the Initial Public Offering on August 9, 2022, an amount of 117,875,000 10.25 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the
sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Placement
Units was placed in a trust account. 

We
intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the funds
held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and excluding
deferred underwriting commissions) to complete our initial business combination. We may withdraw interest to pay our taxes, if any. Our
annual income tax obligations will depend on the amount of interest and other income earned on the amounts held in the trust account.
We expect the interest earned on the amount in the trust account will be sufficient to pay our taxes. We expect the only taxes payable
by us out of the funds in the trust account will be income and franchise taxes, if any. To the extent that our common stock or debt is
used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account
will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our
growth strategies. 

We
do not believe we will need to raise additional funds following this offering in order to meet the expenditures required for operating
our business. However, if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating
an initial business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate
our business prior to our initial business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial
business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our initial
business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. 

9 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going
concern and the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred
and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of the Company s financing and acquisition plans. Management plans
to address this uncertainty with the successful closing of the business combination. The Company will have until May 9, 2023 (or up to
February 9, 2024, as applicable) to consummate a business combination. If a business combination is not consummated by May 9, 2023, less
than one year after the date the accompanying financial statements are issued, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution
of the Company. Management has determined that the mandatory liquidation, should a business combination not occur, and potential subsequent
dissolution, raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made
to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after May 9, 2023. The Company intends to
complete the initial business combination before the mandatory liquidation date. However, there can be no assurance that the Company
will be able to consummate any business combination by May 9, 2023. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of December 31, 2022, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Contractual
Obligations 

Registration
and Stockholder Rights Agreement 

The
holders of the Founder Shares and Placement Units (including securities contained therein) and Units (including securities contained
therein) that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans and extension loans, and any shares of Class A common stock issuable
upon the exercise of the Placement Warrants and any shares of Class A common stock and warrants (and underlying Class A common stock)
that may be issued upon conversion of the Units issued as part of the working capital loans and extension loans and Class A common stock
issuable upon conversion of the Founder Shares, will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement to
be signed prior to or on the effective date of the Proposed Offering, requiring the Company to register such securities for resale (in
the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to the Class A common stock). The holders of these securities are entitled to make
up to two demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company registers such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back 
registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of the initial business combination and
rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. 

Administrative
Support Agreement 

The
Company s Sponsor has agreed, commencing from the date of the Initial Public Offering through the earlier of the Company s
consummation of a business combination and its liquidation, to make available to the Company certain general and administrative services,
including office space, utilities and administrative services, as the Company may require from time to time. The Company has agreed to
pay to Mehana Capital LLC, the Sponsor, 10,000 per month for these services during the 9-month period to complete a business combination.
For the period from March 11, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022, 50,000 was paid to Mehana Capital LLC for these services. 

10 

Underwriters
Agreement 

Simultaneously
with the Initial Public Offering, the underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment option to purchase an additional 1,500,000 Units
at an offering price of 10.00 per Unit for an aggregate purchase price of 15,000,000. 

The
underwriters were paid a cash underwriting discount of 0.17 per Unit, or 1,955,000 in the aggregate, upon the closing of the Initial
Public Offering. In addition, 0.35 per unit, or 4,025,000 in the aggregate will be payable to the underwriters for deferred underwriting
commissions. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event
that the Company completes a business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual
results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: 

Derivative
Financial Instruments 

The
Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded
derivatives in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). For derivative financial instruments that
are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value on the grant date and is then re-valued
at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. For derivative instruments that are
classified as equity, the derivative instruments are initially measured at fair value (or allocated value), and subsequent changes in
fair value are not recognized as long as the contracts continue to be classified in equity. 

Warrants 

The
Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant s
specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815. The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding
financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all
of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company s own common
stock, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted
at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. 

For
issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component
of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification,
the warrants are required to be recorded as liabilities at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date
thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. 

The
warrants are not precluded from equity classification, and are accounted for as such on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet
date thereafter. 

11 

Common
Stock Subject to Possible Redemption 

All
of the Class A common stock sold as part of the Units in the Initial Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the
redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company s liquidation, if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in
connection with the business combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company s amended and restated certificate
of incorporation. In accordance with ASC 480, conditionally redeemable Class A common stock (including shares of Class A common stock
that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain
events not solely within the Company s control) is classified as temporary equity. Ordinary liquidation events, which involve the
redemption and liquidation of all of the entity s equity instruments, are excluded from the provisions of ASC 480. Although the
Company did not specify a maximum redemption threshold, its charter provides that currently, the Company will not redeem its Public Shares
in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets (stockholders equity) to be less than 5,000,001. However, the threshold
in its charter would not change the nature of the underlying shares as redeemable and thus Public Shares would be required to be disclosed
outside of permanent equity. The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value
of redeemable common stock to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Such changes are reflected in additional
paid-in capital, or in the absence of additional paid-in capital, in accumulated deficit. 

Net
Income Per Share 

Net
income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Therefore,
the income per share calculation allocates income shared pro rata between Class A and Class B common stock. As a result, the calculated
net income per share is the same for Class A and Class B common stock. The Company has not considered the effect of the Public Warrants
and Placement Warrants, to purchase an aggregate of 12,134,375 shares in the calculation of income per share, since the exercise of the
warrants is contingent upon the occurrence of future events. 

Recent
Accounting Standards 

In
August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic
470-0) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) ASU 2020-06 to simplify
accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion
and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity
classification of contracts in an entity s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible
debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings
per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-convened method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption
permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 effective March 11, 2022 (inception). The
adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have a material impact on the financial statements. 

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material
effect on the Company s financial statements.

16 

Number
and Terms of Office of Officers and Directors 

We
have five directors. Our board of directors is divided into three classes, with only one class of directors being elected in each year
and with each class (except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual meeting of stockholders) serving a three-year term.
In accordance with the Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual meeting until one year after our
first fiscal year end following our listing on Nasdaq. 

The
term of office of the first class of directors, consisting of Kotaro Chiba, will expire at our first annual meeting of stockholders.
The term of office of the second class of directors, consisting of Darryl Nakamoto and Mike Sayama, will expire at our second annual
meeting of the stockholders. The term of office of the third class of directors, consisting of Trisha Nomura and Dustin Shindo, will
expire at our third annual meeting of stockholders. We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders until after we complete our initial
business combination. We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders until after we complete our initial business combination. 

Prior
to the completion of an initial business combination, any vacancy on the board of directors may be filled by a nominee chosen by holders
of a majority of our founder shares. In addition, prior to the completion of an initial business combination, holders of a majority of
our founder shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason. Pursuant to an agreement to be entered into concurrently
with the issuance and sale of our securities, our sponsor, upon completion of an initial business combination, will be entitled to nominate
individuals for election to our board of directors, as long as our sponsor holds any securities covered by the registration rights agreement. 

Our
officers are appointed by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms
of office. Our board of directors is authorized to nominate persons to the offices set forth in our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation as it deems appropriate. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our officers may consist
of one or more chairman of the board of directors, chief executive officer, president, chief financial officer, vice presidents, secretary,
treasurer and such other offices as may be determined by the board of directors. 

Director
Independence 

Nasdaq
listing standards require that a majority of our board of directors be independent. An independent director is defined
generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship
which in the opinion of the company s board of directors, would interfere with the director s exercise of independent judgment
in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent
directors are present. Kotaro Chiba, Mike Sayama and Trisha Nomura are our independent directors. 

Committees
of the Board of Directors 

Our
board of directors has three standing committees: an audit committee, a compensation committee and a corporate governance and nominating
committee. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, the rules of Nasdaq and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act require that the
audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception,
the rules of Nasdaq require that the compensation committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. 

17 

Audit
Committee 

We
have established an audit committee of the board of directors. Kotaro Chiba, Mike Sayama, and Trisha Nomura will serve as members of
our audit committee. Our board of directors has determined that Messrs. Chiba, Sayama and Nomura meet the independent director standard
under Nasdaq listing standards and under Rule 10-A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act. Trisha Nomura will serve as the chairwoman of the audit
committee. Each member of the audit committee is financially literate, and our board of directors has determined that Ms. Nomura qualifies
as an audit committee financial expert as defined in applicable SEC rules. We have adopted an audit committee charter,
which details the principal functions of the audit committee, including: 

appointing,
 compensating and overseeing our independent registered public accounting firm; 

reviewing
 and approving the annual audit plan for the company; 

overseeing
 the integrity of our financial statements and our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; 

discussing
 the annual audited financial statements and unaudited quarterly financial statements with
 management and the independent registered public accounting firm; 

pre-approving
 all audit services and permitted non-audit services to be performed by our independent registered
 public accounting firm, including the fees and terms of the services to be performed; 

appointing
 or replacing the independent registered public accounting firm; 

establishing
 procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints (including anonymous complaints)
 we receive concerning accounting, internal accounting controls, auditing matters or potential
 violations of law; 

monitoring
 our environmental sustainability and governance practices; 

establishing
 procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by us regarding
 accounting, internal accounting controls or reports which raise material issues regarding
 our financial statements or accounting policies; 

approving
 audit and non-audit services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm; 

discussing
 earnings press releases and financial information provided to analysts and rating agencies; 

discussing
 with management our policies and practices with respect to risk assessment and risk management; 

reviewing
 any material transaction between our Chief Financial Officer that has been approved in accordance
 with our Code of Ethics for our officers, and providing prior written approval of any material
 transaction between us and our President; and 

producing
 an annual report for inclusion in our proxy statement, in accordance with applicable rules
 and regulations. 

The
audit committee is a separately designated standing committee established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act. 

Financial
Experts on Audit Committee 

Pursuant
to Nasdaq rules, the audit committee will at all times be composed exclusively of independent directors who are able to
read and understand fundamental financial statements, including a company s balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement. 

Each
member of the audit committee is financially literate, and our board of directors has determined that Ms. Nomura qualifies as an audit
committee financial expert as defined in applicable SEC rules, which generally is any person who has past employment experience
in finance or accounting, requisite professional certification in accounting, or other comparable experience or background that results
in the individual s financial sophistication. 

18 

Compensation
Committee 

We
have established a compensation committee of our board of directors. The members of our compensation committee are Kotaro Chiba, Mike
Sayama, and Trisha Nomura, and Mr. Sayama will serve as chairman of the compensation committee. Under Nasdaq listing standards and applicable
SEC rules, we are required to have at least two members of the compensation committee, all of whom must be independent directors. Our
board of directors has determined that each Messrs. Chiba, Sayama and Nomura is independent. We have adopted a compensation committee
charter, which details the principal functions of the compensation committee, including: 

reviewing
 and approving corporate goals and objectives relevant to our President s compensation,
 evaluating our President s performance in light of those goals and objectives, and
 setting our President s compensation level based on this evaluation; 

setting
 salaries and approving incentive compensation and equity awards, as well as compensation
 policies, for all other officers who file reports of their ownership, and changes in ownership,
 of the company s common stock under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the Section
 16 Officers ), as designated by our board of directors; 

making
 recommendations to the board of directors with respect to incentive compensation programs
 and equity-based plans that are subject to board approval; 

approving
 any employment or severance agreements with our Section 16 Officers; 

granting
 any awards under equity compensation plans and annual bonus plans to our President and the
 Section 16 Officers; 

approving
 the compensation of our directors; and 

producing
 an annual report on executive compensation for inclusion in our proxy statement, in accordance
 with applicable rules and regulations. 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, as indicated above, other than the payment to Mehana Capital LLC, the Sponsor, of 10,000 per month, for up to nine months,
or 18 months if we have elected to extend the time to complete our initial business combination, for office space, utilities and secretarial
and administrative support, no compensation of any kind, including finders, consulting or other similar fees, will be paid to any of
our existing stockholders, officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order
to effectuate the consummation of an initial business combination. Accordingly, it is likely that prior to the consummation of an initial
business combination, the compensation committee will only be responsible for the review and recommendation of any compensation arrangements
to be entered into in connection with such initial business combination. 

The
charter also provides that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant,
legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such
adviser. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the
compensation committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC. 

Corporate
Governance and Nominating Committee 

We
have established a corporate governance and nominating committee of our board of directors. The members of our corporate governance and
nominating committee are Kotaro Chiba, Mike Sayama, and Trisha Nomura and Mr. Chiba will serve as chairman of the corporate governance
and nominating committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards, we are required to have a corporate governance and nominating committee
composed entirely of independent directors. Our board of directors has determined that each of Messrs. Chiba, Sayama and Nomura is independent. 

The
primary function of the corporate governance and nominating committee include: 

identifying
 individuals qualified to become members of the board of directors and making recommendations
 to the board of directors regarding nominees for election; 

reviewing
 the independence of each director and making a recommendation to the board of directors with
 respect to each director s independence; 

developing
 and recommending to the board of directors the corporate governance principles applicable
 to us and reviewing our corporate governance guidelines at least annually; 

making
 recommendations to the board of directors with respect to the membership of the audit, compensation
 and corporate governance and nominating committees; 

overseeing
 the evaluation of the performance of the board of directors and its committees on a continuing
 basis, including an annual self-evaluation of the performance of the corporate governance
 and nominating committee; 

considering
 the adequacy of our governance structures and policies, including as they relate to our environmental
 sustainability and governance practices; 

considering
 director nominees recommended by stockholders; and 

reviewing
 our overall corporate governance and reporting to the board of directors on its findings
 and any recommendations. 

19 

Guidelines
for Selecting Director Nominees 

The
guidelines for selecting nominees generally provide that persons to be nominated: 

should
 possess personal qualities and characteristics, accomplishments and reputation in the business
 community; 

should
 have current knowledge and contacts in the communities in which we do business and, in our
 industry, or other industries relevant to our business; 

should
 have the ability and willingness to commit adequate time to the board of directors and committee
 matters; 

should
 demonstrate ability and willingness to commit adequate time to the board of directors and
 committee matters; 

should
 possess the fit of the individual s skills and personality with those of other directors
 and potential directors in building a board of directors that is effective, collegial and
 responsive to our needs; and 

should
 demonstrate diversity of viewpoints, background, experience, and other demographics, and
 all aspects of diversity in order to enable the board of directors to perform its duties
 and responsibilities effectively, including candidates with a diversity of age, gender, nationality,
 race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation. 

Each
year in connection with the nomination of candidates for election to the board of directors, the corporate governance and nominating
committee will evaluate the background of each candidate, including candidates that may be submitted by our stockholders. 

Code
of Ethics 

We
have adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees. You can review these documents by accessing our public
filings at the SEC s web site at www.sec.gov. In addition, a copy of the Code of Ethics will be provided without charge upon request
from us. We intend to disclose any amendments to or waivers of certain provisions of our Code of Ethics in a Current Report on Form 8-K. 

Section
16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 

Section
16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, requires our executive officers, directors and persons
who beneficially own more than 10 of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission
initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our shares of common stock and other equity securities. These executive
officers, directors, and greater than 10 beneficial owners are required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a)
forms filed by such reporting persons. 

Delinquent
Section 16(a) Reports 

Based
solely on our review of such forms furnished to us and written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that all filing
requirements applicable to our executive officers, directors and greater than 10 beneficial owners were filed in a timely manner, except
for (i) one Form 4 filed late by Dustin Shindo on March 8, 2023 and (ii) one Form 4 filed late by Mehana Capital LLC on March 8,
2023, each of which was filed late due to administrative error.

ITEM
11. EXECUTIVE
 COMPENSATION 

Employment
Agreements 

We
have not entered into any employment agreements with our executive officers and have not made any agreements to provide benefits upon
termination of employment. 

Executive
Officers and Director Compensation 

None
of our executive officers or directors have received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. In addition, our sponsor, executive
officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations.
Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or
our or their respective affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial business combination will be made using funds held outside
the trust account. Other than quarterly audit committee review of such reimbursements, we do not expect to have any additional controls
in place governing our reimbursement payments to our directors and executive officers for their out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection
with our activities on our behalf in connection with identifying and completing an initial business combination. The founder shares will
be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination. Other than these payments and reimbursements, no compensation of
any kind, including finder s and consulting fees, will be paid by the company to our sponsor, executive officers and directors,
or any of their respective affiliates, prior to completion of our initial business combination. 

After
the completion of our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting or management
fees from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation
materials or tender offer materials furnished to our stockholders in connection with a proposed business combination. We have not established
any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company to our members of management. It is unlikely the amount
of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed business combination because the directors of the post-combination business
will be responsible for determining executive officer and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid to our executive officers
will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a compensation committee constituted solely
by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our board of directors. 

We
do not intend to take any action to ensure that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the completion
of our initial business combination, although it is possible that some or all of our executive officers and directors may negotiate employment
or consulting arrangements to remain with us after our initial business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or
consulting arrangements to retain their positions with us may influence our management s motivation in identifying or selecting
a target business but we do not believe that the ability of our management to remain with us after the completion of our initial business
combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential business combination. We are not party to any
agreements with our executive officers and directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment. 

Compensation
Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 

None
of our executive officers currently serves, and in the past year has not served, as a member of the compensation committee of any entity
that has one or more executive officers serving on our board of directors. 

ITEM
12. SECURITY
 OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS 

The
following table sets forth as of March 7, 2023 the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by (i) each person who is known by
us to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock (ii) each of our officers
and directors; and (iii) all of our officers and directors as a group. As of March 7, 2023, we had 15,066,875 shares of common stock issued
and outstanding, including 12,191,875 shares of Class A common stock, and 2,875,000 shares of Class B common stock. 

21 

Unless
otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares
of common stock beneficially owned by them. The following table does not reflect record of beneficial ownership of any shares of common
stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, as the warrants are not exercisable within 60 days of March 7, 2023.

ITEM
13. CERTAIN
 RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 

Founder
Shares 

On
May 17, 2022, the Sponsor paid an aggregate of 25,000 to cover certain expenses on our behalf in exchange for the issuance of 2,875,000
shares of Class B common stock (the Founder Shares ). The Founder Shares included an aggregate of up to 375,000 shares of
Class B common stock subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor to the extent that the underwriters over-allotment option was not exercised
in full or in part, so that the Sponsor will own, on an as-converted basis, 20 of our issued and outstanding shares after the Initial
Public Offering. The underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full, so those shares are no longer subject to forfeiture. 

The
Sponsor has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Class B common stock (except to certain permitted transferees as disclosed
herein) until, with respect to any of the Class B common stock, the earlier of (i) six months after the date of the consummation of a
business combination, or (ii) the date on which the closing price of our common stock equals or exceeds 12.00 per share (as adjusted
for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing
after a business combination, with respect to the remaining any of the Class B common stock, upon six months after the date of the consummation
of a business combination, or earlier, in each case, if, subsequent to a business combination, we consummate a subsequent liquidation,
merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of our stockholders having the right to exchange their common
stock for cash, securities or other property. 

22 

Promissory
Note - Related Party 

On
April 25, 2022, the Sponsor agreed to loan us an aggregate of up to 300,000 to cover expenses related to the Initial Public Offering
pursuant to a promissory note (the Promissory Note ). This loan was non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i)
March 31, 2023 or (ii) the date on which we consummated the Initial Public Offering. Prior to the Initial Public Offering, we had borrowed
 300,000 under the Promissory Note. The outstanding balance under the Promissory Note of 300,000 was repaid at the closing of the Initial
Public Offering on August 9, 2022. 

Administrative
Support Agreement 

The
Sponsor has agreed, commencing from the date of the Initial Public Offering through the earlier of our consummation of a business combination
and its liquidation, to make available to us certain general and administrative services, including office space, utilities and administrative
services, as we may require from time to time. We have agreed to pay to the Sponsor, 10,000 per month for these services during the
9-month period to complete a business combination. For the period from March 11, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022, 50,000
was paid to Mehana Capital LLC for these services. 

Related
Party Loans 

In
order to finance transaction costs in connection with the initial business combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or
certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete the initial business combination, we will repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion
of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts, including the repayment of loans from the Sponsor
to pay for any amount deposited to pay for any extension of the time to complete the initial business combination, but no proceeds from
the Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into Units, at a price of 10.00
per Unit at the option of the lender, upon consummation of the initial business combination. The Units would be identical to the Placement
Units. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect
to such loans. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any outstanding related party loans. 

General 

If
any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity
to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations
to present such opportunity to such entity. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual
obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. 

Other
than equity provided to our independent directors, no compensation of any kind, including finder s and consulting fees, will be
paid to our sponsor, officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection with
the completion of an initial business combination. However, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable
business combinations. The Sponsor has agreed to pay for the formation costs, and waived to seek reimbursement from the Company for such
costs. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or
their respective affiliates and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or
ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf. 

After
our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees
from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender
offer or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, furnished to our stockholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will
be known at the time of distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a stockholder meeting held to consider our initial
business combination, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director
compensation. We have entered into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which our sponsor is entitled to certain registration
rights with respect to the placement warrants and the shares of our Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of the Founder Shares. 

23 

Policy
for Approval of Related Party Transactions 

Our
audit committee of our board of directors has adopted a charter, providing for the review, approval and/or ratification of related
party transactions, which are those transactions required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K as promulgated
by the SEC, by the audit committee. At its meetings, the audit committee shall be provided with the details of each new, existing or
proposed related party transaction, including the terms of the transaction, any contractual restrictions that the company has already
committed to, the business purpose of the transaction and the benefits of the transaction to the company and to the relevant related
party. Any member of the audit committee who has an interest in the related party transaction under review by the committee shall abstain
from voting on the approval of the related party transaction, but may, if so requested by the chairman of the committee, participate
in some or all of the committee s discussions of the related party transaction. Upon completion of its review of the related party
transaction, the committee may determine to permit or to prohibit the related party transaction. An affirmative vote of a majority of
the members of the audit committee, present at a meeting at which a quorum is present, will be required in order to approve a related
party transaction. A majority of the members of the entire audit committee will constitute a quorum. Without a meeting, the unanimous
written consent of all of the members of the audit committee will be required to approve a related party transaction. Our audit committee
will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by us to our sponsor, officers or directors, or our or any of their affiliates. 

These
procedures are intended to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a
conflict of interest on the part of a director, employee or officer. To further minimize conflicts of interest, we have agreed not to
consummate an initial business combination with an entity that is affiliated with any of our sponsor, officers or directors unless we,
or a committee of independent directors, have obtained an opinion from either an independent investment banking firm that is a member
of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. 

Furthermore,
no finder s fees, reimbursements, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation will be paid
by us to our Sponsor, officers or directors or any affiliate of our Sponsor, officers or directors prior to, for services rendered to
us prior to, or in connection with any services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination
(regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, the following payments will be made to our Sponsor, officers or directors,
or our or their affiliates, none of which will be made from the proceeds of the IPO held in the trust account prior to the completion
of our initial business combination:

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To
the Stockholders and Board of Directors of 

 Pono Capital Two, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Pono Capital Two, Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022, the related
statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity (deficit) and cash flows for the period from March 11, 2022 (inception)
through December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion,
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from March 11, 2022 (inception) through December 31, 2022, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Explanatory
Paragraph Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described
in Note 1 to the financial statements, if the Company is unable to complete a business combination by May 9, 2023, then the Company will
cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. The date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raises substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also
described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

December 31 as its fiscal year end. 

The
registration statement for the Company s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on August 4, 2022. On August 9, 2022, the
Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of

or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for
it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment

of their Public Shares upon the completion of a business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve
the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of
a business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The Public Stockholders will
be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially 
 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest
earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). There will be no
redemption rights upon the completion of a business combination with respect to the Company s warrants. The Public Shares subject
to redemption will be recorded at redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering

The
Company will proceed with a business combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least

(the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a Public Stockholder, together with any affiliate
of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under
Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from seeking redemption
rights with respect to 15 or more of the Public Shares without the Company s prior written consent.

The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to the deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event the
Company does not complete a business combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with

it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering

The
Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company, if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products
sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce
the amounts in the Trust Account to below

party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under the Company s
indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against
a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek
to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have
all vendors, service providers (except for the Company s independent registered accounting firm), prospective target businesses
or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim
of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 

Going
Concern and Liquidity 

The
Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of the Company s financing and acquisition plans.
Management plans to address this uncertainty with the successful closing of the business combination. The Company will have until May
9, 2023 (or up to February 9, 2024, as applicable) to consummate a business combination. If a business combination is not consummated
by May 9, 2023, less than one year after the date these financial statements are issued, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent
dissolution of the Company. Management has determined that the mandatory liquidation, should a business combination not occur, and potential
subsequent dissolution, raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have
been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after May 9, 2023. The Company
intends to complete the initial business combination before the mandatory liquidation date. However, there can be no assurance that the
Company will be able to consummate any business combination by May 9, 2023.

Risks
and Uncertainties 

Management
continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that
the virus could have a negative effect on the Company s financial position, results of its operations, and/or search for a target
company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Additionally,
as a result of the military action commenced in February 2022 by the Russian Federation and Belarus in the country of Ukraine and related
economic sanctions, the Company s ability to consummate a business combination, or the operations of a target business with which
the Company ultimately consummates a business combination, may be materially and adversely affected. Further, the Company s ability
to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by these events,
including as a result of increased market volatility, or decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms
acceptable to the Company or at all. The impact of this action and related sanctions on the world economy and the specific impact on
the Company s financial position, results of operations and/or ability to consummate a business combination are not yet determinable.
These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

On
August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for,
among other things, a new U.S. federal 1 excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and
certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023 (the Excise Tax ).
The Excise Tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount
of the Excise Tax is generally 1 of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes
of calculating the Excise Tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against
the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the Excise Tax. The
U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry
out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the Excise Tax. 

Any
redemption or other repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a business combination, votes relating to certain
amendments to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or otherwise, may be subject to the Excise Tax. Whether
and to what extent the Company would be subject to the Excise Tax in connection with a business combination, votes relating to certain
amendments to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or otherwise would depend on a number of factors,
including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the business combination, extension or otherwise,
(ii) the structure of a business combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any PIPE or other equity issuances in connection
with a business combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a business combination but issued within the same taxable year
of a business combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. The mechanics of any required payment
of the Excise Tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a business combination and in the Company s ability to effect an extension of the time in which the Company must complete a business combination
or complete a business combination.

are a Delaware corporation, and our affairs are governed by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the DGCL. Pursuant
to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation we are authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock, 0.0001
par value, 10,000,000 shares of our Class B common stock, 0.0001 par value, and 1,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, 0.0001
par value. 

Units 

Each
unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one redeemable warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase
one share of our Class A common stock at a price of 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. No fractional warrants will be issued upon
separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. 

Placement
Units 

The
placement units are identical to the units sold in our initial public offering (the IPO except that there will be no redemption
rights with respect to the placement units, which will expire worthless if we do not consummate a business combination within 9 months
from the closing of the IPO (or up to 18 months from the closing of the IPO at the election of the Company pursuant to nine one month
extensions subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including the deposit of up to 379,500 0.033 per unit) for such one month
extension, into the trust account, or as extended by the Company s stockholders in accordance with our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation). 

Common
Stock 

Stockholders
of record are entitled to one vote for each share held (on an as-converted to Class A common stock basis) on all matters to be voted
on by stockholders. Prior to our initial business combination, only holders of our founder shares will have the right to vote on the
appointment of directors. In addition, prior to the completion of an initial business combination, holders of a majority of our founder
shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
may be amended only by approval of 90 of the shares of common stock voting in an annual meeting. With respect to any other matter submitted
to a vote of our stockholders, including any vote in connection with our initial business combination, except as required by law, holders
of our founder shares and holders of our public shares will vote together as a single class, with each share entitling the holder to
one vote for each share held (on an as-converted to Class A common stock basis). 

Unless
specified in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or as required by applicable provisions of the DGCL or applicable
stock exchange rules, the affirmative vote of a majority of our shares of common stock that are voted is required to approve any such
matter voted on by our stockholders. Our board of directors is divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term
of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the election
of directors, with the result that the holders of more than 50 of the shares voted for the election of directors can elect all of the
directors. Our stockholders are entitled to receive ratable dividends when, as and if declared by the board of directors out of funds
legally available therefor. 

Because
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock,
if we were to enter into a business combination, we may (depending on the terms of such a business combination) be required to increase
the number of shares of our Class A common stock which we will be authorized to issue at the same time as our stockholders vote on the
initial business combination to the extent we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination. 

Our
board of directors is divided into three classes with only one class of directors being elected in each year and each class (except for
those directors appointed prior to our first annual meeting of stockholders) serving a three-year term. In accordance with the Nasdaq
corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual meeting until one year after our first fiscal year end following
our listing on Nasdaq. Under Section 211(b) of the DGCL, we are, however, required to hold annual meetings of stockholders for the purpose
of electing directors in accordance with our bylaws, unless such election is made by written consent in lieu of such a meeting. We may
not hold an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the completion of our initial business combination, and thus
we may not be in compliance with Section 211(b) of the DGCL, which requires an annual meeting. Therefore, if our stockholders want us
to hold an annual meeting prior to the completion of an initial business combination, they may attempt to force us to hold one by submitting
an application to the Delaware Court of Chancery in accordance with Section 211(c) of the DGCL. Prior to the completion of an initial
business combination, any vacancy on the board of directors may be filled by a nominee chosen by holders of a majority of our founder
shares. In addition, prior to the completion of an initial business combination, holders of a majority of our founder shares may remove
a member of the board of directors for any reason. 

We
will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our
initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account
calculated as of two business days prior to the completion of our initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds
held in the trust account (net of taxes payable and less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number
of the then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account was initially 10.25
per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred
underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. 

The
redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial owner must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Our
sponsor, directors and each member of our management team have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed
to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion
of our initial business combination and (ii) a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or
to redeem 100 of our public shares if we have not completed an initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial
business combination. Unlike many blank check companies that hold stockholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with
their initial business combinations and provide for related redemptions of public shares for cash upon completion of such initial business
combinations even when a vote is not required by law, if a stockholder vote is not required by applicable law or stock exchange rule
and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC
prior to completing our initial business combination. 

Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires these tender offer documents to contain substantially the same financial and
other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under the SEC s proxy rules.
If, however, a stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange rule, or we decide to obtain stockholder
approval for business or other reasons, we will, like many blank check companies, offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy
solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete
our initial business combination only if a majority of the shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of our initial business combination.
However, the participation of our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their respective affiliates in privately-negotiated transactions,
if any, could result in the approval of our initial business combination even if a majority of our public stockholders vote, or
indicate their intention to vote, against such initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our
outstanding common stock, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. 

If
we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business
combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder,
together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group 
(as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to Excess Shares. However,
we would not be restricting our stockholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our
initial business combination. Our stockholders inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce their influence over our ability
to complete our initial business combination, and such stockholders could suffer a material loss in their investment if they sell such
Excess Shares on the open market. Additionally, such stockholders will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the Excess
Shares if we complete our initial business combination. And, as a result, such stockholders will continue to hold that number of shares
exceeding 15 and, in order to dispose of such shares would be required to sell their shares in open market transactions, potentially
at a loss. 

If
we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement entered
into with us, our sponsor, directors and each member of our management team have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares
purchased during or after the IPO, in favor of our initial business combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem
its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. 

Pursuant
to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, if we have not completed an initial business combination within the period
to consummate the initial business combination, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly
as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem the public
shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account (net of taxes payable and less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses),
divided by the number of the then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights
as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (iii) as promptly
as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate
and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other
applicable law. Our sponsor and members of our management team have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have
agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we do not complete
an initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business combination. However, if our sponsor or members
of our management team acquire public shares in or after the IPO, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account
with respect to such public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time period. 

In
the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company after a business combination, our stockholders are entitled to share
ratably in all assets remaining available for distribution to them after payment of liabilities and after provision is made for each
class of shares, if any, having preference over the common stock. Our stockholders have no preemptive or other subscription rights. There
are no sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock, except that we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity
to redeem their public shares for cash at a per unit price equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including
interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (net of taxes payable and less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses),
divided by the number of the then outstanding public shares, upon the completion of our initial business combination, subject to the
limitations described herein. 

Founder
Shares and Placement Shares 

The
founder shares and placement shares are identical to the shares of Class A common stock included in the units sold in the IPO, and holders
of founder shares and placement shares have the same stockholder rights as public stockholders, except that (i) the founder shares and
placement shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions, as described in more detail below, (ii) our sponsor, officers and directors
have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed (A) to waive their redemption rights with respect to
any founder shares, placement shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination,
(B) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, placement shares, and public shares in connection with a stockholder
vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (i) modify the substance or timing of our obligation
to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 9 months from the closing of the IPO or (ii) with respect to any
other material provisions relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, and (C) to waive their
rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares or placement shares held by them if we
fail to complete our initial business combination within 9 months, or up to 18 months if we have elected to extend the time to complete
our initial business combination, from the closing of the IPO, although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within such time period,
(iii) the founder shares are shares of our founder shares that will automatically convert into shares of our Class A common stock at
the time of our initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment pursuant to certain anti-dilution rights as
described herein and (iv) are entitled to registration rights. If we submit our initial business combination to our public stockholders
for a vote, our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed (and its permitted transferees will agree) pursuant to the letter agreement
to vote any founder shares held by them and any public shares purchased during or after the IPO (including in open market and privately-negotiated
transactions) in favor of our initial business combination. 

Prior
to our initial business combination, only holders of our founder shares will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors.
Holders of our public shares will not be entitled to vote on the appointment of directors during such time. In addition, prior to the
completion of an initial business combination, holders of a majority of our founder shares may remove a member of the board of directors
for any reason. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may only be amended by approval of a majority
of at least 90 of our founder shares voting in an annual meeting. With respect to any other matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders,
including any vote in connection with our initial business combination, except as required by law, holders of our founder shares and
holders of our public shares will vote together as a single class, with each share entitling the holder to one vote. 

Preferred
Stock 

Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock and provide that shares of preferred
stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. Our board of directors are authorized to fix the voting rights, if any,
designations, powers, preferences, the relative, participating, optional or other special rights and any qualifications, limitations
and restrictions thereof, applicable to the shares of each series. Our board of directors are able to, without stockholder approval,
issue shares of preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders
of the common stock and could have anti-takeover effects. The ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without
stockholder approval could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of us or the removal of existing
management. We have no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding at the date hereof. Although we do not currently intend to issue
any shares of preferred stock, we cannot assure you that we will not do so in the future. No shares of preferred stock were issued or
registered in the IPO. 

Public
Stockholders Warrants 

Each
whole warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at a price of 11.50 per share, subject
to adjustment as discussed below, at any time commencing on the later of 12 months from the closing of the IPO and 30 days after the
completion of our initial business combination. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for
a whole number of Class A common stock. This means only a whole warrant may be exercised at a given time by a warrant holder. No fractional
warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. Accordingly, unless you purchase at least two
units, you will not be able to receive or trade a whole warrant. 

The
warrants will expire five years after the completion of our initial business combination, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier
upon redemption or liquidation. 

We
will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation
to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the shares of Class A common
stock and warrants underlying the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to our satisfying
our obligations described below with respect to registration. No warrant will be exercisable, and we will not be obligated to issue shares
of Class A common stock upon exercise of a warrant unless Class A common stock issuable upon such warrant exercise has been registered,
qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants. In the
event that the conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a warrant, the holder of such
warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In no event will we be
required to net cash settle any warrant. In the event that a registration statement is not effective for the exercised warrants, the
purchaser of a unit containing such warrant, if not cash settled, will have paid the full purchase price for the unit solely for the
share of Class A common stock and warrants underlying such unit. 

We
have agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 20 business days after the closing of our initial business combination,
we will use our best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement registering the issuance of the shares of Class A common stock
issuable upon exercise of the warrants, to cause such registration statement to become effective and to maintain a current prospectus
relating to those shares of Class A common stock until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the warrant agreement. If
a registration statement covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th
business day after the closing of our initial business combination or within a specified period following the consummation of our initial
business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when
we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to
the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act; provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another
exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. Once the warrants become exercisable,
we may call the warrants for redemption: 

in
 whole and not in part; 

at
 a price of 0.01 per warrant; 

upon
 not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption given after the warrants
 become exercisable (the 30-day redemption period to each warrant holder; and 

if,
 and only if, the reported last sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds 18.00
 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations
 and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period commencing once the
 warrants become exercisable and ending three business days before we send the notice of redemption
 to the warrant holders. 

If
and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may not exercise our redemption right if the issuance of shares of common stock upon
exercise of the warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or we are unable to effect
such registration or qualification. We will use our best efforts to register or qualify such shares of common stock under the blue-sky
laws of the state of residence in those states in which the warrants were offered by us in the IPO. We have established the last of the
redemption criterion discussed above to prevent a redemption call unless there is at the time of the call a significant premium to the
warrant exercise price. If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and we issue a notice of redemption of the warrants, each warrant holder
will be entitled to exercise its warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date. However, the price of the Class A common stock may fall
below the 18.00 redemption trigger price (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the
like) as well as the 11.50 warrant exercise price after the redemption notice is issued. 

If
we call the warrants for redemption as described above, our management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise
its warrant to do so on a cashless basis. In determining whether to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a
 cashless basis, our management will consider, among other factors, our cash position, the number of warrants that are outstanding
and the dilutive effect on our stockholders of issuing the maximum number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise
of our warrants. If our management takes advantage of this option, all holders of warrants would pay the exercise price by surrendering
their warrants for that number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number
of shares of Class A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and
the fair market value (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. 

The
 fair market value for this purpose shall mean the average reported last sale price of the Class A common stock for the
10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants.
If our management takes advantage of this option, the notice of redemption will contain the information necessary to calculate the number
of shares of Class A common stock to be received upon exercise of the warrants, including the fair market value in such
case. Requiring a cashless exercise in this manner will reduce the number of shares to be issued and thereby lessen the dilutive effect
of a warrant redemption. We believe this feature is an attractive option to us if we do not need the cash from the exercise of the warrants
after our initial business combination. If we call our warrants for redemption and our management does not take advantage of this option,
our sponsor and its permitted transferees would still be entitled to exercise their placement warrants for cash or on a cashless basis
using the same formula described above that other warrant holders would have been required to use had all warrant holders been required
to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, as described in more detail below. 

A
holder of a warrant may notify us in writing in the event it elects to be subject to a requirement that such holder will not have the
right to exercise such warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, such person (together with such person s
affiliates), to the warrant agent s actual knowledge, would beneficially own in excess of 4.9 or 9.8 (or such other amount as
a holder may specify) of the shares of Class A common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. 

If
the number of outstanding shares of Class A common stock is increased by a stock dividend payable in shares of Class A common stock,
or by a split-up of shares of Class A common stock or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such stock dividend, split-up
or similar event, the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable on exercise of each whole warrant will be increased in proportion
to such increase in the outstanding shares of Class A common stock. A rights offering to holders of Class A common stock entitling holders
to purchase shares of Class A common stock at a price less than the fair market value will be deemed a stock dividend of a number of
shares of Class A common stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Class A common stock actually sold in such rights
offering (or issuable under any other equity securities sold in such rights offering that are convertible into or exercisable for Class
A common stock) and (ii) one (1) minus the quotient of (x) the price per share of Class A common stock paid in such rights offering divided
by (y) the fair market value. For these purposes (i) if the rights offering is for securities convertible into or exercisable for Class
A common stock, in determining the price payable for Class A common stock, there will be taken into account any consideration received
for such rights, as well as any additional amount payable upon exercise or conversion and (ii) fair market value means the volume weighted
average price of Class A common stock as reported during the ten (10) trading day period ending on the trading day prior to the first
date on which the shares of Class A common stock trade on the applicable exchange or in the applicable market, regular way, without the
right to receive such rights. 

In
addition, if we, at any time while the warrants are outstanding and unexpired, pay a dividend or make a distribution in cash, securities
or other assets to the holders of Class A common stock on account of such shares of Class A common stock (or other shares of our capital
stock into which the warrants are convertible), other than (a) as described above, (b) certain ordinary cash dividends, (c) to satisfy
the redemption rights of the holders of Class A common stock in connection with a proposed initial business combination, (d) to satisfy
the redemption rights of the holders of Class A common stock in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial
business combination or certain amendments to our charter prior thereto or to redeem 100 of our Class A common stock if we do not complete
our initial business combination within 9 months from the closing of the IPO or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to
stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, or (e) in connection with the redemption of our public shares
upon our failure to complete our initial business combination, then the warrant exercise price will be decreased, effective immediately
after the effective date of such event, by the amount of cash and/or the fair market value of any securities or other assets paid on
each share of Class A common stock in respect of such event. 

If
the number of outstanding shares of our Class A common stock is decreased by a consolidation, combination, reverse stock split or reclassification
of shares of Class A common stock or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such consolidation, combination, reverse stock
split, reclassification or similar event, the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable on exercise of each warrant will be decreased
in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares of Class A common stock. 

Whenever
the number of shares of Class A common stock purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants is adjusted, as described above, the warrant
exercise price will be adjusted by multiplying the warrant exercise price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction (x) the
numerator of which will be the number of shares of Class A common stock purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants immediately prior
to such adjustment, and (y) the denominator of which will be the number of shares of Class A common stock so purchasable immediately
thereafter. 

In
case of any reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock (other than those described above or
that solely affects the par value of such shares of Class A common stock), or in the case of any merger or consolidation of us with or
into another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which we are the continuing corporation and that does not result in
any reclassification or reorganization of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock), or in the case of any sale or conveyance to
another corporation or entity of the assets or other property of us as an entirety or substantially as an entirety in connection with
which we are dissolved, the holders of the warrants will thereafter have the right to purchase and receive, upon the basis and upon the
terms and conditions specified in the warrants and in lieu of the shares of our Class A common stock immediately theretofore purchasable
and receivable upon the exercise of the rights represented thereby, the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or property
(including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, reorganization, merger or consolidation, or upon a dissolution following any
such sale or transfer, that the holder of the warrants would have received if such holder had exercised their warrants immediately prior
to such event. 

However,
if less than 70 of the consideration receivable by the holders of Class A common stock in such a transaction is payable in the form
of Class A common stock in the successor entity that is listed for trading on a national securities exchange or is quoted in an established
over-the-counter market, or is to be so listed for trading or quoted immediately following such event, and if the registered holder of
the warrant properly exercises the warrant within thirty days following public disclosure of such transaction, the warrant exercise price
will be reduced as specified in the warrant agreement based on the Black-Scholes value (as defined in the warrant agreement) of the warrant.
The purpose of such exercise price reduction is to provide additional value to holders of the warrants when an extraordinary transaction
occurs during the exercise period of the warrants pursuant to which the holders of the warrants otherwise do not receive the full potential
value of the warrants in order to determine and realize the option value component of the warrant. This formula is to compensate the
warrant holder for the loss of the option value portion of the warrant due to the requirement that the warrant holder exercise the warrant
within 30 days of the event. The Black-Scholes model is an accepted pricing model for estimating fair market value where no quoted market
price for an instrument is available. 

The
warrants were issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, as warrant
agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure
any ambiguity or correct any mistake, including to conform the provisions of the warrant agreement to the description of the terms of
the warrants and the warrant agreement set forth in the prospectus for the IPO, or defective provision, but requires the approval by
the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of
the registered holders of public warrants. 

In
addition, if (x) we issue additional shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection
with the closing of our initial business combination at a Newly Issued Price of less than 9.20 per share of Class A common stock (with
such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by our board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance
to our sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into account any founder shares held by our sponsor or such affiliates, as applicable,
prior to such issuance), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60 of the total equity proceeds, and
interest thereon, available for the funding of our initial business combination on the date of the consummation of our initial business
combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the Market Value is below 9.20 per share, then the exercise price of the warrants will be
adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115 of the greater of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the 18.00 per
share redemption trigger price described above will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180 of the greater of the Market
Value and the Newly Issued Price. 

The
warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the warrant
agent, with the exercise form on the reverse side of the warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated, accompanied by full
payment of the exercise price (or on a cashless basis, if applicable), by certified or official bank check payable to us, for the number
of warrants being exercised. The warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of Class A common stock and any voting
rights until they exercise their warrants and receive shares of Class A common stock. After the issuance of shares of Class A common
stock upon exercise of the warrants, each holder will be entitled to one (1) vote for each share held of record on all matters to be
voted on by stockholders. 

No
fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive
a fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number of shares of Class A common stock to
be issued to the warrant holder. 

We
have agreed that, subject to applicable law, any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the
warrant agreement will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, and we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction will be the exclusive forum for any such action,
proceeding or claim. This provision applies to claims under the Securities Act but does not apply to claims under the Exchange Act or
any claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. 

Dividends 

We
have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of a business
combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements
and general financial conditions subsequent to completion of a business combination. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to
a business combination will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. If we incur any indebtedness, our ability
to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith. 

Our
Transfer Agent 

The
transfer agent for our common stock is Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company. We have agreed to indemnify Continental Stock
Transfer Trust Company in its role as transfer agent, its agents and each of its stockholders, directors, officers and employees
against all claims and losses that may arise out of acts performed or omitted for its activities in that capacity, except for any claims
and losses due to any gross negligence or intentional misconduct of the indemnified person or entity. 

Our
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation 

Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions designed to provide certain requirements and restrictions relating
to the IPO that will apply to us until the completion of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without
the approval of the holders of 65 of our common stock. Our initial stockholders and their permitted transferees, if any, will participate
in any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose.
Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that: 

If
 we have not completed an initial business combination within the period to consummate the
 initial business combination, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of
 winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter,
 redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount
 then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the
 trust account (net of taxes payable and less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution
 expenses), divided by the number of the then outstanding public shares, which redemption
 will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the
 right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably
 possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders
 and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations
 under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable
 law; 

Prior
 to or in connection with our initial business combination, we may not issue additional securities
 that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii)
 vote on our initial business combination or on any other proposal presented to stockholders
 prior to or in connection with the completion of an initial business combination; 

Although
 we do not intend to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated
 with our sponsor, our directors or our executive officers, we are not prohibited from doing
 so, and in the event we enter into such a transaction, we, or a committee of independent
 directors, will obtain an opinion from either an independent investment banking firm that
 is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination
 is fair to our company from a financial point of view; 

Furthermore,
 in the event that we seek such a business combination, we expect that the independent members
 of our board of directors would be involved in the process for considering, and approving
 the transaction; 

If
 a stockholder vote on our initial business combination is not required by applicable law
 or stock exchange rule and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other
 reasons, we will offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation
 14E of the Exchange Act, and will file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing
 our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other
 information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required
 under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act; 

In
 accordance with Nasdaq rules, our initial business combination must occur with one or more
 target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the
 assets held in the trust account (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts
 held in trust and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of
 the agreement to enter into the initial business combination; 

If
 our stockholders approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
 that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection
 with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not
 complete an initial business combination within the period to consummate the initial business
 combination, or with respect to any other provisions relating to stockholders rights
 or pre-initial business combination activity, we will provide our public stockholders with
 the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A common stock upon such approval
 at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the
 trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (net of taxes
 payable and less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the
 number of the then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein;
 and 

We
 will not effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or
 a similar company with nominal operations. 

In
addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that under no circumstances will we redeem our public shares
in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than 5,000,001. 

Certain
Anti-Takeover Provisions of Delaware Law and our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws 

We
are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL regulating corporate takeovers upon completion of the IPO. This statute prevents
certain Delaware corporations, under certain circumstances, from engaging in a business combination with: 

a
 stockholder who owns 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock (otherwise known as an interested
 stockholder ); 

an
 affiliate of an interested stockholder; or 

an
 associate of an interested stockholder, for three years following the date that the stockholder
 became an interested stockholder. 

A
 business combination includes a merger or sale of more than 10 of our assets. However, the above provisions of Section
203 do not apply if: 

our
 board of directors approves the transaction that made the stockholder an interested
 stockholder, prior to the date of the transaction; 

after
 the completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested
 stockholder, that stockholder owned at least 85 of our voting stock outstanding at the time
 the transaction commenced, other than statutorily excluded shares of common stock; or 

on
 or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the initial business combination is approved
 by our board of directors and authorized at a meeting of our stockholders, and not by written
 consent, by an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock not
 owned by the interested stockholder. 

Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors.
As a result, in most circumstances, a person can gain control of our board of directors only by successfully engaging in a proxy contest
at two or more annual meetings. 

Our
authorized but unissued common stock and preferred stock will be available for future issuances without stockholder approval and could
be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future offerings to raise additional capital, acquisitions and employee benefit
plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage
an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise. 

Exclusive
forum for certain lawsuits 

Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in
our name, actions against directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and certain other actions may be brought only
in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware, except any action (A) as to which the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware determines
that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent
to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive
jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery or (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter
jurisdiction. If an action is brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service
of process on such stockholder s counsel. Although we believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in
the application of law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, a court may determine that this provision is unenforceable, and
to the extent it is enforceable, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. 

Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the exclusive forum provision will be applicable to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, subject to certain exceptions. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over
all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result,
the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other
claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides
that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action
arising under the Securities Act, or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. We note, however, that there is uncertainty as
to whether a court would enforce this provision and that investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules
and regulations thereunder. Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for state and federal courts over all suits
brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. 

Special
meeting of stockholders 

Our
bylaws provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by a majority vote of our board of directors, or by our Chief
Executive Officer. 

Advance
notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations 

Our
bylaws provide that stockholders seeking to bring business before our annual meeting of stockholders, or to nominate candidates for election
as directors at our annual meeting of stockholders, must provide timely notice of their intent in writing. To be timely, a stockholder s
notice will need to be received by the company secretary at our principal executive offices not later than the close of business on the
90th day nor earlier than the opening of business on the 120th day prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual
meeting of stockholders. Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act, proposals seeking inclusion in our annual proxy statement must comply
with the notice periods contained therein. Our bylaws also specify certain requirements as to the form and content of a stockholders 
meeting. These provisions may preclude our stockholders from bringing matters before our annual meeting of stockholders or from making
nominations for directors at our annual meeting of stockholders. 

Action
by written consent 

Subsequent
to the consummation of the offering, any action required or permitted to be taken by our common stockholders must be effected by a duly
called annual or special meetings of such stockholders and may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders other than with
respect to our founder shares. 

Classified
board of directors 

Our
board of directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, with members of each class serving staggered three-year
terms. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by
resolution of the board of directors. Subject to the terms of any preferred stock, any or all of the directors may be removed from office
at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding
shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. Any vacancy on
our board of directors, including a vacancy resulting from an enlargement of our board of directors, may be filled only by vote of a
majority of our directors then in office. 

Class
B Common Stock Consent Right 

For
so long as any shares of our founder shares remain outstanding, we may not, without the prior vote or voting separately as a single class,
amend, alter or repeal any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise,
if such amendment, alteration or repeal would alter or change the powers, preferences or relative, participating, optional or other or
special rights of the founder shares. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the holders of our founder shares
may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action
so taken, shall be signed by the holders of the outstanding founder shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would
be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares of our founder shares were present and voted. 

Rule
144 

Pursuant
to Rule 144, a person who has beneficially owned restricted shares for at least six months would be entitled to sell their securities
provided that (i) such person is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the three months
preceding, a sale and (ii) we are subject to the Exchange Act periodic reporting requirements for at least three months before the sale
and have filed all required reports under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act during the 12 months (or such shorter period as we
were required to file reports) preceding the sale. 

Persons
who have beneficially owned restricted shares for at least six months but who are our affiliates at the time of, or at any time during
the three months preceding, a sale, would be subject to additional restrictions, by which such person would be entitled to sell within
any three-month period only a number of securities that does not exceed the greater of: 

1 
 of the total number of shares of common stock then outstanding, which equals 150,669 shares
 immediately after the IPO; or 

the
 average weekly reported trading volume of shares of our Class A common stock during the four
 calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to the sale. 

Sales
by our affiliates under Rule 144 are also limited by manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current
public information about us. 

Restrictions
on the Use of Rule 144 by Shell Companies or Former Shell Companies 

Rule
144 is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by shell companies (other than business combination related shell
companies) or issuers that have been at any time previously a shell company. However, Rule 144 also includes an important exception to
this prohibition if the following conditions are met: 

the
 issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company; 

the
 issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d)
 of the Exchange Act; and 

the
 issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and material required to be filed,
 as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was
 required to file such reports and materials), other than Form 8-K reports; and at least one
 year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current Form 10 type information with
 the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company. 

As
a result, our initial stockholders will be able to sell their founder shares and placement units (including component securities contained
therein), as applicable, pursuant to Rule 144 without registration one year after we have completed our initial business combination. 

Registration
Rights 

The
holders of the founder shares and placement units (including securities contained therein) and units (including securities contained
therein) that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans and extension loans, and any shares of Class A common stock issuable
upon the exercise of the placement warrants and any shares of Class A common stock and warrants (and underlying Class A common stock)
that may be issued upon conversion of the units issued as part of the working capital loans and extension loans and Class A common stock
issuable upon conversion of the founder shares and the representative shares which will be issued to the representative upon consummation
of the Company s initial public offering, will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement signed
on the effective date of the IPO, requiring us to register such securities for resale (in the case of the founder shares, only after
conversion to our Class A common stock). The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to two demands, excluding short form
demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect
to registration statements filed subsequent to our completion of our initial business combination and rights to require us to register
for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. 

However,
the registration rights agreement provides that we will not permit any registration statement filed under the Securities Act to become
effective until termination of the applicable lockup period, which occurs (i) in the case of the founder shares, as described in the
following paragraph, and (ii) in the case of the placement warrants, 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination.
The registration rights agreement does not contain liquidated damages or other cash settlement provisions resulting from delays in registering
our securities. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. 

Except
as described herein, our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares and
placement units until the earlier to occur of: (A) six months after the completion of our initial business combination or (B) subsequent
to our initial business combination, (x) if the last sale price of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds 12.00 per unit (as adjusted
for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day
period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business combination, or (y) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger,
capital stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of our stockholders having the right to exchange
their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property.
