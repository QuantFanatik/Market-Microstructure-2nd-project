 PART I Item 1. Business. O verview We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination. We have generated no operating revenues to date and we will not generate operating revenues until we consummate our initial business combination. While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any stage of its corporate evolution or in any industry, sector or geographic location, we are focusing our search in the restaurant, hospitality, and related technology and services sectors (the Target Sectors ). We are sourcing initial business combination opportunities through our management team s extensive network of restaurant, hospitality and related technology and service business owners, public and private company executives and board members, investment bankers, private equity and debt investors, high net worth families and their advisors, commercial bankers, attorneys, management consultants, accountants and other transaction intermediaries. We believe this approach, as well as our management team s recognized track record of completing acquisitions across a variety of subsectors within the restaurant, hospitality and related technology and service sectors will provide meaningful opportunities to drive value creation for stockholders. Our directors have significant experience with acquisitions, divestitures and corporate strategy and implementation, as well as the public markets, which we believe will meaningfully benefit us as we evaluate potential initial business combinations, including the Quality Gold Business Combination (as discussed below), as well as after completing an initial business combination, to the extent they remain on our board of directors following the completion of our initial business combination. Initial Public Offering and Extension of our Combination Period On January 12, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 27,600,000 units, including 3,600,000 units issued pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option in full. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock for 11.50 per share. The units were sold at a price of 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of 276,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 8,700,000 warrants to our sponsor, Tastemaker Sponsor LLC, at a purchase price of 1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of 8,700,000. A total of 278,760,000, comprised of the net proceeds from the sale of the units in the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants was placed in the trust account maintained by Continental, acting as trustee. It is the job of our sponsor and management team to complete our initial business combination. Our management team is led by co-Chief Executive Officers Dave Pace and Andy Pforzheimer, our President, Greg Golkin and our Chief Financial Officer, Chris Bradley, who have many years of experience in the Target Sectors. We must complete our initial business combination by the end of the Combination Period, July 12, 2023, 30 months (including an Extension Period of 6 months as approved at our Extension Special Meeting) from the closing of our initial public offering. If our initial business combination is not consummated by the end of the Combination Period, our existence will terminate, and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account.

 We originally had up to 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, or until January 12, 2023, to consummate an initial business combination. However, at the Extension Special Meeting held on December 12, 2022, our stockholders approved the amendment to the articles of incorporation to extend the end of the Combination Period from January 12, 2023 on a monthly basis to July 12, 2023. In connection with the Extension Special Meeting, stockholders holding 24,673,073 public shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account. As a result, approximately 251.6 million (approximately 10.20 per share) was removed from the trust account and paid to such holders and approximately 29.8 million remained in the trust account. Following the redemptions, as of December 31, 2022, we had 2,926,927 public shares outstanding. Quality Gold Business Combination On October 20, 2022, we entered into Quality Gold Business Combination Agreement with New Parent, the Merger Subs and the Quality Gold Companies, pursuant to which the Company and the Quality Gold Companies will enter into a business combination. The terms of the Quality Gold Business Combination Agreement, which contains customary representations and warranties, covenants, closing conditions and other terms relating to the Mergers (as defined below) and the other transactions contemplated thereby, are summarized below. Capitalized terms used in this Report but not otherwise defined herein have the meanings given to them in the Quality Gold Business Combination Agreement. Structure of the Transaction The acquisition is structured as a double dummy transaction, resulting in the following: (a) Each of New Parent and the Mergers Subs are newly formed entities that were formed for the sole purpose of entering into and consummating the transactions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement. New Parent is a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Quality Gold and each Merger Sub is a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of New Parent.
 (b) On the Closing Date (as defined below), each of the following transactions will occur contemporaneously: (i) Tastemaker Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation will merge with and into the Company (the First Merger ), with the Company surviving the First Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Parent (the First Surviving Company (ii) QGM Merger Sub, Inc., an Ohio corporation will merge with and into QGM, LLC, an Ohio limited liability company QGM and the Second Merger , respectively), with QGM surviving the Second Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Parent (the Second Surviving Company (iii) J M Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation will merge with and into J M Group Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation J M and the Third Merger , respectively), with J M surviving the merger as a subsidiary of New Parent (the Third Surviving Company (iv) L L Merger Sub, Inc., an Ohio corporation will merge with and into L L Group Holdings, LLC, an Ohio limited liability company L L and the Fourth Merger , respectively), with L L surviving the merger as a subsidiary of New Parent (the Fourth Surviving Company and (v) Quality Gold Merger Sub, Inc., an Ohio corporation will merge with and into to Quality Gold, Inc., an Ohio corporation (respectively Quality Gold and the Fifth Merger, and together with the First Merger, the Second Merger, the Third Merger and the Fourth Merger, the Mergers ), with Quality Gold surviving the merger as a subsidiary of New Parent (the Fifth Surviving Company and, together with the First Surviving Company, the Second Surviving Company, the Third Surviving Company and the Fourth Surviving Company, the Surviving Companies ). Following the transactions, the Surviving Companies will be wholly-owned subsidiaries of New Parent.
 (c) The Third Merger will terminate the S election of J M because New Parent, a C corporation, is ineligible to own shares of an S corporation. The portion of J M s taxable year ending the day before the Closing Date will be treated as a short taxable year for which J M is an S corporation; the portion of J M s taxable year beginning on the Closing Date will be treated as a short taxable year for which J M is a C corporation. Likewise, the Fifth Merger will terminate the S election of Quality Gold. The portion of Quality Gold s taxable year ending the day before the Closing Date will be treated as a short taxable year for which Quality Gold is an S corporation; the portion of Quality Gold s taxable year beginning on the Closing Date will be treated as a short taxable year for which Quality Gold is a C corporation.

Certain Related Agreements Support Agreement In connection with the execution of the Quality Gold Business Combination Agreement, we entered into the Support Agreement with Michael Langhammer and Jason Langhammer and entities controlled by such individuals that currently own equity interests in any of the Quality Gold Companies (including trusts for the benefit of any family member of the foregoing) (collectively, the Key Quality Gold Equityholders ). Pursuant to the Support Agreement, each Key Quality Gold Equityholder, as an equityholder of the Quality Gold Companies, agreed to vote at any meeting of the equityholders of such Quality Gold Company, and in any action by written consent of the equityholders of each Quality Gold Company, all of such Key Quality Gold Equityholder s Quality Gold Company Shares: in favor of the approval and adoption of the Quality Gold Business Combination Agreement and related transaction documents, including the Mergers, in favor of any matter reasonably necessary to the consummation of the Quality Gold Business Combination and considered and voted upon by the equityholders of the Quality Gold Company, in favor of any proposal to adjourn or postpone to a later date any meeting of the equityholders of such Quality Gold Company at which any of the foregoing matters are submitted for consideration and vote of the equityholders of the Quality Gold Company if there are not sufficient votes for approval of any such matters on the date on which the meeting is held, and against at any action, agreement or transactions (other than the Quality Gold Business Combination Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby) or proposal that would reasonably be expected to (i) prevent, impede, delay or adversely affect in any material respects the transactions contemplated by the Quality Gold Business Combination Agreement or any other transaction document or (ii) result in failure of the transactions contemplated by the Quality Gold Business Combination to be consummated. 
 Additionally, each of the Key Quality Gold Equityholders has agreed (i) not to, among other things, sell, assign, transfer, or dispose of any of the Quality Gold Company Shares they hold, (ii) to repay in full, at or prior to the Effective Time, any indebtedness owed by the Key Quality Gold Equityholder to any Quality Gold Company and its respective subsidiaries and (iii) indemnify the Quality Gold Companies and their respective subsidiaries for certain tax liabilities, if incurred. Each Key Quality Gold Equityholder has also agreed to terminate all agreements between itself or any of its affiliates and any of the Quality Gold Companies and their respective subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. Sponsor Support and Waiver Letter Agreement Concurrently with the execution of the Quality Gold Business Combination Agreement, Quality Gold entered into the Sponsor Support and Waiver Letter Agreement with the sponsor, pursuant to which the sponsor has agreed to vote all of its shares of our common stock (a) in favor of the approval and adoption of the Quality Gold Business Combination Agreement and other transaction documents, (b) in favor of any other matter reasonably necessary to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Quality Gold Business Combination Agreement, and (c) against at any action, agreement or transactions (other than the Quality Gold Business Combination Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby) or proposal that would reasonably be expected to (i) prevent or materially delay the transactions contemplated by the Quality Gold Business Combination Agreement or any other transaction document or (ii) result in failure of the transactions contemplated by the Quality Gold Business Combination to be consummated.

 At the Effective Time, the sponsor will automatically forfeit up to 2,070,000 shares of New Parent Common Stock and, immediately after the Effective Time, will transfer 2,610,000 private placement warrants to equityholders of the Quality Gold Companies. In connection with the Closing, the sponsor will subject 2,070,000 Deferred Sponsor Shares to certain restrictions pending the achievement of certain price targets or other triggers pursuant to the Quality Gold Business Combination Agreement. For more information, see the section above entitled Consideration Forfeiture and Deferral of New Parent Equity. The number of forfeited shares of New Parent Common Stock described above will be reduced by (i) the number of founder shares and (ii) one-third of the number of our private placement warrants, in each case, that are transferred by the sponsor to facilitate any private placement of our equity securities or those of New Parent, any non-redemption agreement, or any similar arrangement, in each case, approved by the Quality Gold Companies. Copies of the Support Agreement and Sponsor Support and Waiver Letter Agreement are filed with this Report as Exhibits 10.11 and 10.12 respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing descriptions of the Support Agreement and Sponsor Support and Waiver Letter Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to those exhibits. As contemplated by the Quality Gold Business Combination Agreement, New Parent will also enter into a registration rights and lock-up agreement at the closing of the Quality Gold Business Combination. Additionally, effective as of the closing of the Quality Gold Business Combination, the Company, New Parent, and Continental, as warrant agent, will enter into the warrant assignment, assumption and amendment agreement, which will amend the Warrant Agreement we entered into with Continental in connection with our initial public offering. Other than as specifically discussed, this Report does not assume the closing of the Quality Gold Quality Gold Business Combination. Our Management Team Our management team brings a unique combination of executive, operating, investing, financial and transactional experience across the Target Sectors. Messrs. Pace and Pforzheimer are highly experienced restaurant executives and operators, with strong track records driving growth and stockholder value with several of the nation s leading brands. Messrs. Golkin and Bradley have extensive mergers and acquisitions, public and private capital markets, transaction structuring and strategy consulting experience. Mr. Bradley also has specific experience with SPACs as Chief Financial Officer of Haymaker I, Haymaker II, Haymaker III and AF Acquisition Corp. We believe that our access to and affiliation with our independent directors represents a distinct competitive advantage, and that they provide extensive experience in business and financial matters. Companies and investment firms with a member of our management team in an executive, partner or board role have completed over 100 merger and acquisition, capital markets and private investing transactions since 2010. Business Strategy Our acquisition and value creation strategy is to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, continue to build and expand a growth-oriented company in the Target Sectors, such as the Quality Gold Companies, that complements the experience of our management team and can benefit from our operational, finance and capital markets experience. Our business combination strategy leverages the network of our management team for proprietary and other transaction sources where we believe a combination of our relationships, knowledge and experience could effect a positive transformation and expansion of existing businesses to significantly drive stockholder value. We have utilized and will continue to utilize the networks and industry experience of the members of our management team and their affiliates in seeking an initial business combination and employing our business combination strategy. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team and their affiliates have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships that we believe serve as a useful source of acquisition opportunities. This network has been developed through us having: extensive experience in both operating and investing in public and private companies in the Target Sectors;

Table of Contents 
 track records in marketing and growing companies through driving profitable revenue and unit growth, optimizing unit economics, employing omni-channel business models, leveraging franchising, increasing brand awareness and customer engagement, and deploying technology; longstanding relationships with a wide variety of potential sellers, including founders, financial sponsors and management teams of potential target companies; and experience in sourcing, structuring, acquiring, operating, developing, growing, financing and selling businesses under varying economic and financial market conditions. These networks are providing our management team with a robust flow of acquisition opportunities. In addition, target business candidates have been brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, which include investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. In addition, drawing on their extensive investing and operating experiences, our leadership and overall team anticipates tapping four major sources of deal flow: directly identifying attractive growth-oriented companies and potentially undervalued opportunities through primary research into industries and companies; receiving information from our relationships and contacts about potentially attractive situations; contact from securities broker-dealers research, sales, trading or investment banking department offering or identifying businesses seeking a combination or added value that matches our strengths; or inbound opportunities from a company or existing stakeholders seeking a combination, including sales, mergers and corporate divestitures. 
 Our Acquisition Criteria Consistent with this strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses including the Quality Gold Companies. While we have used and will continue to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating initial business combination opportunities, including the Quality Gold Business Combination, we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that meets some but not all of these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire companies that we believe: have strong and differentiated brands, strong unit economics and market share, exceptional management teams and significant growth prospects; would benefit from our extensive networks and insights within the Target Sectors, and leverage our transaction and capital markets expertise; are fundamentally sound companies that may benefit from capital and public company catalysts, or that may be currently underperforming their potential for various reasons and offer a compelling value; can benefit from a strategic partnership with our management team to achieve long-term strategic success and operational excellence; exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics, desirable returns on capital, and a need for capital or recapitalization to achieve the given company s growth strategy;

 will offer an attractive risk-adjusted return for our stockholders; and will have an expected enterprise value, at the time of our initial business combination, of approximately 400 million to 1 billion. 
 These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that meets some but not all of the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria and guidelines in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC, such as the Quality Gold Registration Statement. Our Acquisition Process In evaluating a prospective target business, such as the Quality Gold Companies, we conduct a thorough due diligence review which encompasses, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us. We also utilize our operational and capital allocation experience. We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. While the Quality Gold Companies are not affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, in the event we do not consummate the Quality Gold Business Combination and we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that our initial business combination is fair to us from a financial point of view. Certain members of our management team directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or private placement warrants following our initial public offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors is included by a target business as a condition to our initial business combination. Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entities. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she has honored and will continue to honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability complete our business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. Our officers and independent directors may become officers or directors of another SPAC with a class of securities registered or intended to be registered under the Exchange Act, even before we have completed our initial business combination.

 Initial Business Combination Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of our initial business combination will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading multiples of comparable public businesses or a valuation based on the financial metrics of M A transactions of comparable businesses. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target s assets or prospects. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors. Based on the valuation analysis of our management and board of directors, we have determined that the fair market value of the Quality Gold Companies was substantially in excess of 80 of the funds in the trust account and that the 80 test was therefore satisfied. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. We anticipate structuring our initial business combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100 of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100 of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders. However, we will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50 or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50 or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100 controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100 of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq s 80 fair market value test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80 fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable. Status as a Public Company We believe our structure as a public company makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses, including the Quality Gold Companies. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. See Quality Gold Business Combination above for more information regarding such an exchange in the Quality Gold Business Combination. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses, such as the Quality Gold Companies, will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.

 Furthermore, once a proposed business combination, such as the Quality Gold Business Combination, is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following January 12, 2026, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. Additionally, we are a smaller reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds 250 million as of the end of that year s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded 100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of the end of that year s second fiscal quarter. Financial Position As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 30,312,244 held in the trust account and 40,801 held outside the trust account available for a business combination (assuming no redemptions in connection with a business combination, after payment of up to 10,350,000 of deferred underwriting fees, and before fees and expenses associated with our initial business combination). As such, we offer a target business, such as the Quality Gold Companies, a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt or leverage ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us. Effecting our Initial Business Combination We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations until we consummate our initial business combination. We intend to complete our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 
 11 

Table of Contents 
 If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other assets, companies or for working capital. We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity in connection with the completion of our initial business combination (which may include a specified future issuance), and we may complete our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering or loans rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by applicable law or we decide to do so for business or other reasons, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately, including pursuant to any specified future issuance, or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. Sources of Target Businesses We have received and may continue to receive a number of proprietary transaction opportunities to originate as a result of the business relationships, direct outreach, and deal sourcing activities of our management team. In addition to the proprietary deal flow, target business candidates have been and may continue to be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms, private equity groups, large business enterprises, and other market participants. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this annual report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our management team, as well as some of their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate. In no event will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). We may pay such financial consulting fee in the event such party or parties provide us with specific target company, industry, financial or market expertise, as well as insights, relationships, services or resources that we believe are necessary in order to assess, negotiate and consummate an initial business combination. The amount of any such financial consulting fee we pay will be based upon the prevailing market for similar services for comparable transactions at such time, and will be subject to the review of our audit committee pursuant to the audit committee s policies and procedures relating to transactions that may present conflicts of interest. We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. While the Quality Gold Companies are not affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, in the event we do not consummate the Quality Gold Business Combination and we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Any such entity may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by making a specified future issuance to any such entity.

Table of Contents 
 Lack of Business Diversification We may complete our initial business combination with a single target business or multiple target businesses simultaneously or within a short period of time. However, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination with more than one target business because of various factors, including the existence of complex accounting issues and the requirement that we prepare and file pro forma financial statements with the SEC that present operating results and the financial condition of several target businesses as if they had been operated on a combined basis. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments. Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. In addition, we intend to focus our search for an initial business combination in a single industry. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be: solely dependent upon the performance of a single business, property or asset; or dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services. 
 This lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our initial business combination. Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target s Management Team Although we closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business, including the management team of the Quality Gold Companies, when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, and plan to continue to do so if the Quality Gold Business Combination is not consummated and we seek other business combination opportunities, our assessment of the target business management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, including the Quality Gold Business Combination, it is presently unknown if any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business or that they will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. Following our initial business combination, to the extent that we deem it necessary, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management team of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange rule (as is the case for the Quality Gold Business Combination as currently contemplated), or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction.

Type of Transaction Whether Stockholder Approval is Required Purchase of assets No Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the Company No Merger of target into a subsidiary of the Company No Merger of the Company with a target Yes Under Nasdaq s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example: we issue shares of Class A common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20 of the number of shares of our Class A common stock then outstanding; any of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5 or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10 or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding common shares or voting power of 5 or more; or the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control. 
 The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which stockholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange rules will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and legal reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine stockholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek stockholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company; the expected cost of holding a stockholder vote; the risk that the stockholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination; other time and budget constraints of the company; and additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to stockholders. 
 See Quality Gold Business Combination above for more information regarding the requisite approvals needed in the Quality Gold Business Combination. Permitted Purchases of, and Other Transactions with Respect to, Our Securities In the event we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates may purchase public shares or public warrants or a combination thereof in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of securities such persons may purchase subject to compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such purchases or other transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such purchases or other transactions. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares or warrants in such transactions.

 Such persons will be subject to restrictions in making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. We have adopted an insider trading policy which requires insiders to refrain from purchasing our securities during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information and to clear all trades with our legal counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1plan, as such purchases will be dependent upon several factors, including, but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary. In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates purchase public shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our initial business combination, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares and any proxy to vote against our initial business combination. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules. The purpose of any such transaction could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination, (ii) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination or (iii) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such transactions may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our Class A common stock or warrants and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, possibly making it difficult to obtain or maintain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated transactions by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders (in the case of public shares) following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates enter into a private transaction, they would identify and contact only potential selling or redeeming stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates will be restricted from purchasing shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. Any purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will be restricted unless such purchases are made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will be restricted from making purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. See Quality Gold Business Combination above for more information regarding such purchases in connection with the Quality Gold Business Combination.

 Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, such as the Quality Gold Business Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, net of taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account, as of December 31, 2022, was approximately 10.20 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. See Quality Gold Business Combination above for more information regarding the additional agreements entered into in connection with the Quality Gold Business Combination. Manner of Conducting Redemptions We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination, such as the Quality Gold Business Combination, or (ii) by means of a tender offer if the Quality Gold Business Combination is not consummated. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed initial business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Under Nasdaq rules, asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our Company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20 of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. If we structure an initial business combination with a target company in a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed initial business combination. We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirements or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. So long as we maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with such rules. If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 
 Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, we and our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.

Table of Contents 
 In the event that we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares which are not purchased by our sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least 5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters fees and commissions (so that we are do not then become subject to the SEC s penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and file proxy materials with the SEC. In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination. If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted by the stockholders at a duly held stockholders meeting are voted to approve the business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our sponsor, officers and directors will count toward this quorum and have agreed to vote any founder shares and any public shares held by them in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As of December 31, 2022, after accounting for the redemption of public shares in connection with the approval of the additional Extension Period at the Extension Special Meeting, the sponsor owns 70.2 of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Accordingly, the sponsor will have the ability, voting on its own, to satisfy quorum requirements and to approve an initial business combination, and none of our public shares will need to vote in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved. We intend to give approximately 30 days (but not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days) prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our sponsor, officers and directors, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least 5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters fees and commissions (so that we are do not then become subject to the SEC s penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and instead may search for an alternate business combination.

 See Quality Gold Business Combination above for more information regarding the requisite approvals needed for the Quality Gold Business Combination. Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the DWAC System, at the holder s option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately 100.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or two business days prior to the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable (unless we elect to allow additional withdrawal rights). Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination. If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. If the Quality Gold Business Combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a different business combination until July 12, 2023 or during any additional Extension Period. Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have until July 12, 2023 to complete our initial business combination. If we have not completed our initial business combination by the end of the Combination Period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, net of taxes payable (less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination by the end of the Combination Period.

 Our sponsor, officers and directors have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we liquidate. However, if our sponsor, officers or directors acquire public shares after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by the end of the Combination Period. Our sponsor, officers, and directors have agreed, pursuant to a letter agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we have not completed our initial business combination prior to the end of the Combination Period or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by the end of the Combination Period, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares of Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least 5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters fees and commissions (so that we are do not then become subject to the SEC s penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business combination. We expect to use the amounts held outside the trust account 40,801 as of December 31, 2022) to pay for all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, if we do not complete an initial business combination prior to the end of the Combination Period, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes on interest income earned on the trust account balance, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to 100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account and any tax payments or expenses for the dissolution of the trust, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be 10.10. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than 10.10. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors claims. Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest and claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Marcum, our

 independent registered public accounting firm will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, nor will the underwriters of our initial public offering. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (except for the Company s independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or by a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) 10.10 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor s only assets are securities of our Company. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than 10.10 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per public share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) 10.10 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations and we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than 10.10 per public share. We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We may have access to use the amounts held outside the trust account 40,801 as of December 31, 2022) to pay any such potential claims but these amounts may be spent on expenses incurred as a result of being a public company or due diligence expenses on prospective business combination candidates. In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors.

 Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we have not completed our initial business combination within the Combination Period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, net of taxes payable (less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the end of our acquisition period and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) 10.10 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.

 If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return 10.10 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and our Company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only on the earliest of (a) the completion of our initial business combination and then, only in connection with those public shares that such stockholder has properly elected to redeem, subject to certain limitations, (b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by the end of the Combination Period or (ii) with respect to any other provisions relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity and (c) the redemption of our public shares if we have not completed our business combination prior to the end of the Combination Period, subject to applicable law. Stockholders who do not exercise their rights to the funds in connection with an amendment to our certificate of incorporation would still have rights to the funds in connection with a subsequent business combination. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholder s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights as described above. Holders of warrants will not have any rights of proceeds held in the trust account with respect to the warrants. Competition In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, such as the Quality Gold Companies, for our initial business combination, we have encountered and may continue to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Employees We have five officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they devote in any time period varies based on the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full- time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Periodic Reporting and Financial Information We have registered our units, Class A common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports, including this Report, have contained and will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
 22 

Table of Contents 
 We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business, such as the Quality Gold Registration Statement. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with GAAP and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with PCAOB standards. We cannot assure you that any particular target business selected by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and PCAOB standards or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with GAAP and PCAOB standards. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements on our internal control over financial reporting. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. Item 1A. Risk Factors. As a smaller reporting company under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include risk factors in this Report. However, below is a partial list of material risks, uncertainties and other factors that could have a material effect on the Company and its operations: We are a blank check company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective. If the Quality Gold Business Combination is not consummated, we may not be able to select an appropriate target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination within the Combination Period, including the Quality Gold Business Combination. Our public stockholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our initial proposed business combination, which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our public stockholders do not support such a combination. If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our public stockholders vote. If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, and if you or a group of stockholders are deemed to hold in excess of 15 of our Class A common stock, you will lose the ability to redeem all such shares in excess of 15 of our Class A common stock. Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions. Our sponsor contributed 25,000, or approximately 0.004 per founder share, and, accordingly, you will experience immediate and substantial dilution from the purchase of our Class A common stock. Your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination will be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash, unless we seek stockholder approval of the business combination. 
 23 

Table of Contents 
 The ability of our public stockholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a target. The ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure. 
 The ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your stock. The requirement that we complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination and may limit the time we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets, in particular as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our initial business combination on terms that would produce value for our stockholders. We may not be able to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate, in which case our public stockholders may only receive 10.20 per share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, and our warrants will expire worthless. If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates may enter into certain transactions, including purchasing shares or warrants from the public, which may influence the outcome of a proposed business combination and reduce the public float of our securities. If a stockholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our initial business combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed. Our search for a business combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected by the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and other events and the status of debt and equity markets. As the number of special purpose acquisition companies evaluating targets increases, attractive targets may become scarcer and there may be more competition for attractive targets. This could increase the cost of our initial business combination and could even result in our inability to find a target if the Quality Gold Business Combination is not consummated or to consummate an initial business combination. You will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust account, except under certain limited circumstances. To liquidate your investment, therefore, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss. You will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies. Because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately 10.20 per share on our redemption of our public shares, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, and our warrants will expire worthless. Our expectations around the performance of a prospective target business or businesses, such as the Quality Gold Companies, may not be realized.

 We may not be successful in retaining or recruiting required officers, key employees or directors following our initial business combination. Our officers and directors may have difficulties allocating their time between the Company and other businesses and may potentially have conflicts of interest with our business or in approving our initial business combination. We may not be able to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination or reduce the number of stockholders requesting redemption. We may issue our shares to investors in connection with our initial business combination at a price that is less than the prevailing market price of our shares at that time. You may not be given the opportunity to choose the initial business target or to vote on the initial business combination. Trust account funds may not be protected against third party claims or bankruptcy. An active market for our public securities may not develop and you will have limited liquidity and trading. The availability to us of funds from interest income on the trust account balance may be insufficient to operate our business prior to the business combination. Our financial performance following a business combination with an entity may be negatively affected by their lack an established record of revenue, cash flows and experienced management. Changes in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an initial business combination. We may attempt to simultaneously complete business combinations with multiple prospective targets, which may hinder our ability to complete our initial business combination and give rise to increased costs and risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability. We may engage one or more of our underwriters or one of their respective affiliates to provide additional services to us after the initial public offering, which may include acting as a financial advisor in connection with an initial business combination or as placement agent in connection with a related financing transaction. Our underwriters are entitled to receive deferred underwriting commissions that will be released from the trust account only upon a completion of an initial business combination. These financial incentives may cause them to have potential conflicts of interest in rendering any such additional services to us after the initial public offering, including, for example, in connection with the sourcing and consummation of an initial business combination. We may attempt to complete our initial business combination with a private company about which little information is available, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all. Our warrants are accounted for as derivative liabilities and are recorded at fair value upon issuance with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock or may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination.

 Since our initial stockholders will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed (other than with respect to any public shares they may acquire during or after the initial public offering), and because our sponsor, officers and directors may profit substantially even under circumstances in which our public stockholders would experience losses in connection with their investment, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business combination. Changes in laws or regulations or how such laws or regulations are interpreted or applied, or a failure to comply with any laws or regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations. The value of the founder shares following completion of our initial business combination is likely to be substantially higher than the nominal price paid for them, even if the trading price of our common stock at such time is substantially less than 10.20 per share. Resources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we have not completed our initial business combination within the Combination Period, our public stockholders may receive only approximately 10.20 per share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. In March 2022, the SEC has issued proposed rules relating to certain activities of SPACs. Certain of the procedures that we, a potential business combination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with such proposals may increase our costs and the time needed to complete our initial business combination and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete an initial business combination. The need for compliance with such proposals may cause us to liquidate the funds in the trust account or liquidate the Company at an earlier time than we might otherwise choose. If we are deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we would be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities would be severely restricted. As a result, in such circumstances, unless we are able to modify our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we may abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead liquidate the Company. To mitigate the risk that we might be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we have converted all of the Company s investments in the trust account into cash, which will remain in the trust account, as of the 24-month anniversary of the effective date of our IPO Registration Statement until the earlier of the consummation of our initial business combination or our liquidation. As a result, following the liquidation of investments in the trust account, we would likely receive minimal interest, if any, on the funds held in the trust account, which would reduce the dollar amount our public stockholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company. We may not be able to complete an initial business combination with certain potential target companies if a proposed transaction with the target company may be subject to review or approval by regulatory authorities pursuant to certain U.S. or foreign laws or regulations. Recent increases in inflation and interest rates in the United States and elsewhere could make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination. Military conflict in Ukraine or elsewhere may lead to increased price volatility for publicly traded securities, which could make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination. 
 A 1 U.S. federal excise tax may be imposed on us in connection with our redemptions of shares in connection with a business combination or other stockholder vote pursuant to which stockholders would have a right to submit their shares for redemption.

 We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. If we are unable to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. If the Quality Gold Business Combination is not consummated within the Combination Period, and the funds held outside of our trust account are insufficient to allow us to operate until the end of the Combination Period, our ability to fund our search for a target business or businesses or complete an initial business combination may be adversely affected. There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern . Our ability to consummate an initial business combination may be adversely affected by economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets. Adverse developments affecting the financial services industry, including events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance by financial institutions, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or our prospects. The funds in our operating account and our trust account are held in banks or other financial institutions. Our cash held in non-interest bearing and interest-bearing accounts would exceed any applicable Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insurance limits. Should events, including limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments occur with respect to the banks or other financial institutions that hold our funds, or that affect financial institutions or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks, our liquidity may be adversely affected. For example, on March 10, 2023, the FDIC announced that Silicon Valley Bank had been closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. Although we did not have any funds in Silicon Valley Bank or other institutions that have been closed, we cannot guarantee that the banks or other financial institutions that hold our funds will not experience similar issues. In addition, investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it more difficult for us to acquire financing on terms favorable to us in connection with a potential business combination, or at all, and could have material adverse impacts on our liquidity, our business, financial condition or results of operations, and our prospects. For the complete list of risks relating to our operations, see the sections titled Risk Factors contained in our (i) IPO Registration Statement, (ii) Quarterly Reports on Form10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022, filed with the SEC on May 17, 2022, August 15, 2022 and November 10, 2022, respectively, and (iii) Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on November 18, 2022. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risks could arise that may also affect our business or ability to consummate an initial business combination. For a description of risks relating to the Quality Gold Companies and the Quality Gold Business Combination, please see the Quality Gold Registration Statement. We may disclose changes to such risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. Not applicable. Item 2.

The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of our initial business combination. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to our initial business combination will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. In addition, our board of directors is not currently contemplating and does not anticipate declaring any stock dividends in the foreseeable future. Further, if we incur any indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith. (d) Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans None. (e) Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities None. (f) Use of Proceeds from the Initial Public Offering None.

 In connection with the Extension Special Meeting, stockholders holding 24,673,073 public shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account. As a result, approximately 251.6 million (approximately 10.20 per share) was removed from the trust account and paid to such holders and approximately 29.8 million remained in the trust account. Following the redemptions, as of December 31, 2022, we had 2,926,927 public shares outstanding.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Report including, without limitation, statements in this section regarding our financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward- looking statements. When used in this Report, words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend and similar expressions, as they relate to us or our management, identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are qualified in their entirety by this paragraph. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report. Overview We are a blank check company incorporated on August 10, 2020 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effectuating a business combination. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the initial public offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of the initial public offering or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. Quality Gold Business Combination On October 20, 2022, we entered into Quality Gold Business Combination Agreement with New Parent, the Merger Subs and the Quality Gold Companies, pursuant to which the Company and the Quality Gold Companies will enter into a business combination. The consideration payable under the Quality Gold Business Combination Agreement to the equityholders of the Quality Gold Companies 
 29 

Table of Contents 
 consists of a combination of cash and shares of New Parent and our stockholders and warrant holders will receive shares and warrants of New Parent. For a more detailed description of the Quality Gold Business Combination Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein, please see Item 1. Business and the Quality Gold Registration Statement. Extension of our Combination Period We originally had up to 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, or until January 12, 2023, to consummate an initial business combination. However, at the Extension Special Meeting held on December 12, 2022, our stockholders approved the amendment to the articles of incorporation to extend the end of the Combination Period from January 12, 2023 on a monthly basis to July 12, 2023. In connection with the Extension Special Meeting, stockholders holding 24,673,073 public shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account. As a result, approximately 251.6 million (approximately 10.20 per share) was removed from the trust account and paid to such holders and approximately 29.8 million remained in the trust account. Following the redemptions, as of December 31, 2022, we had 2,926,927 public shares outstanding. Recent Developments On January 11, 2023, we issued the Extension Promissory Note, a promissory note in the principal amount of up to 878,078 to the sponsor, pursuant to which the sponsor agreed to loan the company up to 878,078 in connection with the extension of our time to consummate a business combination from January 12, 2023 on a monthly basis to July 12, 2023. In connection with the approval of the additional Extension Period at the Extension Special Meeting, we deposited 146,346, or approximately 0.05 per public share that was not redeemed in connection with the Extension Special Meeting, into the trust account in connection with the first drawdown under the Extension Promissory Note. We will continue to deposit an additional 146,346 into the trust account for each calendar month (commencing on January 12, 2023 and ending on the 12th day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof, that is needed for us to complete an initial business combination. Such amounts will be distributed either to: (i) holders of shares of Class A common stock upon our liquidation or (ii) holders of shares of Class A common stock who elect to have their shares redeemed in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination. The sponsor or its designee will have the sole discretion whether to continue extending for additional calendar months until July 12, 2023 and if the sponsor determines not to continue extending for additional calendar months, its obligation to make additional advances will terminate. Results of Operations We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities for the period from August 10, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2022 were formation and operational activities, and since the closing of the initial public offering, those related to identifying a target company for a business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents held after the initial public offering. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had net income of 7,097,636, which primarily resulted from a gain in the change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 7,875,000, interest income on the trust account of 3,862,680, and interest income on the operating account of 5, partially offset by operating costs of 3,713,371, income tax expense of 723,378, franchise tax expense of 200,000, and a loss on the change in fair value of the convertible promissory note to a related party of 3,300. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had net income of 8,634,557, which resulted primarily from a gain on the change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 10,350,006, and interest income of 60,347, partially offset by operating and formation costs of 838,745, franchise tax expense of 200,424, and expensed offering costs of 736,627. Liquidity and Capital Resources On January 12, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 27,600,000 units, including 3,600,000 units issued pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option in full, generating gross proceeds of 276,000,000. Simultaneously with the 
 30 

Table of Contents 
 consummation of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of 8,700,000 private placement warrants to the sponsor at a purchase price of 1.00 per warrant, generating gross proceeds of 8,700,000. For the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in operating activities was 1,516,908, which was primarily due to operational costs, income taxes, and franchise taxes paid during the period. For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities was 1,048,019, which was due to a non-cash gain on the change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 10,350,006, changes in working capital of 8,879, and interest income on investments held in the trust account of 60,318 offset in part by our net income of 8,634,557 and expensed offering costs added back to net income of 736,627. For the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash provided by investing activities was 252,370,754, which resulted from cash withdrawn from trust account for payment to redeeming stockholders of 251,600,365 and proceeds from the trust account used to pay for franchise and income taxes of 770,389. For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in investing activities of 278,760,000 was the result of the amount of net proceeds from our initial public offering being deposited to the trust account. For the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash used in financing activities was 250,994,265, which was a result of payments made to redeeming stockholders of 251,600,365 partially offset by proceeds from convertible promissory notes of 520,000 and proceeds from promissory note of 86,100. For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities of 279,970,523 was comprised of 270,480,000 in proceeds from the issuance of units in our initial public offering net of underwriter s discount paid, 1,352,400 of reimbursed offering costs, and 8,700,000 in proceeds from the issuance of warrants in a private placement to our sponsor, offset by the payment of 366,877 for offering costs associated with the initial public offering and repayment of the outstanding balance on the IPO Promissory Note to our sponsor of 195,000. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had cash of 40,801 and 181,220, respectively, held outside the trust account. We intend to use the funds held outside the trust account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a business combination. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required on a non-interest basis. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. The terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. We anticipate that the cash held outside of the trust account as of December 31, 2022, will not be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next 12 months from the issuance of the financial statements, assuming that an initial business combination is not consummated during that time. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of our acquisition plans. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern from the date that the financial statements are released to July 12, 2023, the date at which we must complete an initial business combination, which is less than one year from the issuance of the financial statements. If an initial business combination is not consummated by July 12, 2023, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. There is no assurance that our plans to consummate the initial business combination will be successful or successful within the Combination Period. The financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 Contractual Obligations Registration Rights The holders of the founder shares, private placement warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans (and any Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the private placement warrants) have registration rights to require us to register a sale of any of its securities held by them pursuant to a registration rights agreement. The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of a business combination. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Administrative Support Agreement We entered into an agreement, commencing on the effective date of the initial public offering, to pay the sponsor a total of 10,000 per month for secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of the business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we incurred expenses of 120,000 and 108,000 under this agreement. Underwriting Agreement We granted the underwriters of our initial public offering a 45-day option to purchase up to 3,600,000 additional units to cover over-allotments at the initial public offering price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions. On January 12, 2021, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full and purchased 3,600,000 units at an offering price of 10.00 per unit, generating additional gross proceeds for us of 36,000,000. The underwriters were paid a cash underwriting fee of 0.20 per unit, or 5,520,000 in the aggregate. In addition, 0.375 per unit, or 10,350,000 in the aggregate will be payable to the underwriters for deferred underwriting commissions. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the trust account solely in the event that we complete an initial business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. On September 14, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with the underwriter to perform financial advisory services as needed by the Company in connection with the initial business combination. Pursuant to this agreement, the underwriter amended the terms of the deferred underwriting fees owed in connection with the initial public offering. The underwriter agreed to waive the 10,350,000 deferred underwriting commission payable by the Company pursuant to the underwriting agreement, dated January 7, 2021, while the Company agreed to pay the underwriter for its services as a financial advisor a cash acquisition fee of 4,000,000 plus a 4,000,000 subordinated note (payable in cash or common stock New Parent) to be issued by New Parent. As a result of the amended terms, the aggregate fees payable to the underwriter that are contingent on the completion of the initial business combination are approximately 8.0 million. Additionally, the waiver of the 10,350,000 of deferred underwriting commission payable is contingent on the completion of the initial business combination. Vendor Agreements On September 23, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with a financial advisor (the First Financial Advisor for capital market advisory services in connection with an initial business combination, pursuant to which the Company will pay the First Financial Advisor a fee of 700,000 contingent upon the successful consummation of the initial business combination. On October 11, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with a financial advisor (the Second Financial Advisor for capital market advisory services in connection with an initial business combination, pursuant to which the Company will pay the Second Financial Advisor a fee of 1,000,000 contingent upon the successful consummation of the initial business combination.

 Related Party Loans On March 22, 2022, we entered into the March Sponsor Working Capital Loan with the sponsor in the amount of 150,000, pursuant to which we received proceeds of 150,000. The March Sponsor Working Capital Loan is non-interest bearing and payable upon the earlier of (i) completion of the initial business combination or (ii) the date our winding up is effective. The unpaid principal balance on the March Sponsor Working Capital Loan may be convertible into warrants at the option of the sponsor at a price of 1.00 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. As of December 31, 2022, the total amount drawn on the March Sponsor Working Capital Loan was 150,000. On July 21, 2022, we entered into the July Sponsor Working Capital Loan, a separate working capital loan with the sponsor in the amount of 375,000. The July Sponsor Working Capital Loan matures on the earliest to occur of (i) the date on which we consummate our initial business combination and (ii) the date that our winding up is effective. The promissory note in connection with the July Sponsor Working Capital Loan is convertible into warrants at 1.00 per warrant on terms identical to those of the private placement warrants. On July 21, 2022, the Company drew 370,000 from the promissory note, which has not yet been repaid as of December 31, 2022. On December 9, 2022, the Company issued a promissory note (the Second Promissory Note in the principal amount of up to 1,000,000 to the Sponsor. The Second Promissory Note was issued in connection with advances the Sponsor has made, and may make in the future, to the Company for working capital expenses. The loan is non-interest bearing and payable upon the earlier of (i) completion of the Initial Business Combination or (ii) the date the winding up of the Company is effective. December 9, 2022, the Company drew 86,100 from the Second Promissory Note, which has not yet been repaid as of December 31, 2022. The fair value option was elected (see Note 10 of the financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report) and, as such, the fair value of both of the Sponsor Working Capital Loans is shown on the balance sheets as 77,900. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: Convertible Promissory Note - Related Party We account for the convertible promissory notes in connection with the Sponsor Working Capital Loans under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). We have made the election under ASC 815-15-25 to account for the notes under the fair value option. Using the fair value option, the convertible promissory notes are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet thereafter. Differences between the face value of the note and fair value at issuance are recognized as either an expense in the statements of operations (if issued at a premium) or as a capital contribution (if issued at a discount). Any material changes in the estimated fair value of the notes are recognized as non-cash gains or losses in the statements of operations. Warrant Liabilities We account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 and ASC 815. The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to our own common stock, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance.

 For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments required that we record the warrants as derivative liabilities at fair value upon the closing of the initial public offering. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we estimated the fair value of the warrant derivative liabilities to be 3,375,000 and 11,250,000, respectively. Class A Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption All of the 27,600,000 shares of Class A common stock sold as part of the units in the initial public offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such public shares in connection with our liquidation, if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with the initial business combination and in connection with certain amendments to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation. In accordance with the SEC and its staff s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within our control require common stock subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Therefore, all Class A common stock has been classified outside of permanent equity. Net Income Per Share of Common Stock Net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Remeasurement associated with the redeemable shares of Class A common stock is excluded from net income per share as the redemption value approximates fair value. Therefore, the earnings per share calculation allocates income shared pro rata between Class A and Class B common stock. As a result, the calculated net income per share is the same for Class A and Class B shares of common stock. We have not considered the effect of the warrants sold in the initial public offering and private placement to purchase an aggregate of 22,500,000 shares in the calculation of diluted income per share, since the exercise of the warrants are contingent upon the occurrence of future events. Recent Accounting Standards Our management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report. Factors That May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations Our results of operations and our ability to complete an initial business combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted by, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in interest rates, supply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including resurgences and the emergence of new variants, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflict in Ukraine. We cannot at this time fully predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete an initial business combination. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this Item.

 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Reference is made to pages F-1 through F-28 comprising a portion of this Report, which are incorporated herein by reference. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer (the Certifying Officers carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation, the Certifying Officers concluded that, due to the Company s restatement of its January 12, 2021, March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021, and September 30, 2022 financial statements relating to the accounting for complex financial instruments, and the inaccurate reporting of period end accruals on the Company s June 30, 2022 financial statements, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Management concluded that material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting existed relating to the accounting treatment for complex financial instruments and the recording of accruals. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Management s Annual Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting As required by SEC rules and regulations implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our company,

Table of Contents 
 (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2022 and 2021. In making these assessments, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective, due to the material weaknesses described elsewhere in this Report. Notwithstanding these material weaknesses, management has concluded that our audited financial statements included in this Report are fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with GAAP for each of the periods presented therein.This Report does not include an attestation report of our internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm due to our status as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Other than as discussed above, there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B. Other Information. None. Item 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections. Not applicable.

 Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, only holders of our Class B common stock will have the right to vote on the election of directors. Holders of our public shares will not be entitled to vote on the election of directors during such time. In addition, prior to the completion of our initial business combination, holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may only be amended by a resolution passed by the holders of a majority of shares of our Class B common stock. Our officers are appointed by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board of directors is authorized to appoint persons to the offices set forth in our bylaws as it deems appropriate. Our bylaws provide that our officers may consist of one or more Chairmen (or Vice Chairmen) of the Board, one or more Chief Executive Officers, a President, a Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Vice Presidents, Secretary, Treasurer and such other offices as may be determined by the board of directors. Committees of the Board of Directors Our board of directors has two standing committees: an audit committee and a compensation committee. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, Nasdaq rules and Rule10A-3of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors, and Nasdaq rules require that the compensation committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. Each committee operates under a charter that has been approved by our board of directors and has the composition and responsibilities described below. The charter of each committee is available on our website, tastemakeracquisition.com. Audit Committee We have established an audit committee of the board of directors. Ms. Johnson and Messrs. Federico and Rosser serve as members of our audit committee, and Ms. Johnson chairs the audit committee. Under Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least three members of the audit committee, all of whom must be independent. Ms. Johnson and Messrs. Federico and Rosser meet the independent director standard under Nasdaq listing standards and under Rule 10-A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act. Each member of the audit committee is financially literate and our board of directors has determined that Ms. Johnson qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in applicable SEC rules and has accounting or related financial management expertise. We have adopted an audit committee charter, which details the principal functions of the audit committee, including: the appointment, compensation, retention, replacement, and oversight of the work of the independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us; pre-approving all audit and permitted non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us, and establishing pre-approval policies and procedures; setting clear hiring policies for employees or former employees of the independent registered public accounting firm, including but not limited to, as required by applicable laws and regulations; setting clear policies for audit partner rotation in compliance with applicable laws and regulations; obtaining and reviewing a report, at least annually, from the independent registered public accounting firm describing (i) the independent registered public accounting firm s internal quality-control procedures, (ii) any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, or peer review, of the audit firm, or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities within the preceding five years respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the firm and any steps taken to deal with such issues and (iii) all relationships between the independent registered public accounting firm and us to assess the independent registered public accounting firm s independence;

 reviewing and approving any related party transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC prior to us entering into such transaction; and reviewing with management, the independent registered public accounting firm, and our legal advisors, as appropriate, any legal, regulatory or compliance matters, including any correspondence with regulators or government agencies and any employee complaints or published reports that raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies and any significant changes in accounting standards or rules promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Compensation Committee We have established a compensation committee of the board of directors. Messrs. Federico and Rosser serve as members of our compensation committee. Mr. Federico serves as chair of the compensation committee. Under Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least two members of the compensation committee, all of whom must be independent, subject to certain phase-in provisions. Messrs. Federico and Rosser meet the independent director standard under Nasdaq listing standards applicable to members of the compensation committee. We have adopted a compensation committee charter, which details the purpose and responsibilities of the compensation committee, including: reviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our co-Chief Executive Officers compensation, if any is paid by us, evaluating our co-Chief Executive Officers performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our co-Chief Executive Officers based on such evaluation; reviewing and approving on an annual basis the compensation, if any is paid by us, of all of our other officers; reviewing on an annual basis our executive compensation policies and plans; implementing and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans; assisting management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements; approving all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our officers and employees; if required, producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and reviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as indicated above, other than the payment to our sponsor of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support and reimbursement of expenses, no compensation of any kind, including finders, consulting or other similar fees, has been or will be paid to any of our initial stockholders, officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to complete the consummation of our initial business combination. We may pay such financial consulting fee in the event such party or parties provide us with specific target company, industry, financial or market expertise, as well as insights, relationships, services or resources that we believe are necessary in order to assess, negotiate and consummate an initial business combination. The amount of any such financial consulting fee we pay will be based upon the prevailing market for similar services for comparable transactions at such time and will be subject to the review of our audit committee pursuant to the audit committee s policies and procedures relating to transactions that may present conflicts of interest. Accordingly, it is likely that prior to the consummation of an initial business combination, such as the Quality Gold Business Combination, the compensation committee will only be responsible for the review and recommendation of any compensation arrangements to be entered into in connection with such initial business combination. 
 41 

Table of Contents 
 The charter also provides that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC. Director Nominations We do not have a standing nominating committee though we intend to form a corporate governance and nominating committee as and when required to do so by law or Nasdaq rules. In accordance with Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq rules, a majority of the independent directors may recommend a director nominee for selection by the board of directors. The board of directors believes that the independent directors can satisfactorily carry out the responsibility of properly selecting or approving director nominees without the formation of a standing nominating committee. The directors who participate in the consideration and recommendation of director nominees are Ms. Johnson and Messrs. Federico, Rosser and Heyer. In accordance with Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq rules, all such directors are independent. As there is no standing nominating committee, we do not have a nominating committee charter in place. The board of directors will also consider director candidates recommended for nomination by our stockholders during such times as they are seeking proposed nominees to stand for election at the next annual meeting of stockholders (or, if applicable, a special meeting of stockholders). Our stockholders that wish to nominate a director for election to our board of directors should follow the procedures set forth in our bylaws. We have not formally established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess. In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, the board of directors considers educational background, diversity of professional experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom, and the ability to represent the best interests of our stockholders. Code of Business Conduct and Ethics We have adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees. We have filed a copy of our Code of Ethics and our audit and compensation committee charters as exhibits to the IPO Registration Statement. Copies of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and our audit and compensation committee charters are available for review by accessing our public filings at the SEC s web site at www.sec.gov. In addition, a copy of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics will be provided without charge upon request from us. We intend to disclose any amendments to or waivers of certain provisions of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics in a Current Report on Form 8-K. Item 11. Executive Compensation. None of our officers or directors has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. Other than the payment to our sponsor of 10,000 per month described elsewhere in this Report, no compensation of any kind, including finder s and consulting fees, has been or will be paid by us to our sponsor, officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Our audit committee reviews on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by us to our sponsor, officers or directors, or our or their affiliates. After the completion of our initial business combination, directors or members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting or management fees from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders in connection with a proposed business combination, such as the Quality Gold Registration Statement. We have not established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company to our directors or members of management. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed business combination, because the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining officer and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid to our officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our board of directors. We are not party to any agreements with our officers that provide for benefits upon termination of employment.

 Following a business combination, to the extent we deem it necessary, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management team of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters. The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of March 28, 2023 based on information obtained from the persons named below, with respect to the beneficial ownership of common stock, by: each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5 of our outstanding shares of common stock; each of our executive officers and directors that beneficially owns shares of our common stock; and all our executive officers and directors as a group. In the table below, percentage ownership is based on 9,826,927 shares of our common stock, consisting of (i) 2,926,927 shares of our Class A common stock, and (ii) 6,900,000 shares of our Class B common stock, issued and outstanding as of March 28, 2023. Voting power represents the combined voting power of shares of Class A common stock and shares of Class B common stock owned beneficially by such person. On all matters to be voted upon, except for the election of directors of the board, the holders of the shares of Class A common stock and shares of Class B common stock vote together as a single class, unless otherwise required by applicable law. Currently, all of the shares of Class B common stock are convertible into Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. Unless otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock beneficially owned by them. The following table does not reflect record or beneficial ownership of the private placement warrants as these warrants are not exercisable within 60 days of the date of this Report.

 (3) Our sponsor is the record holder of such shares. Dave Pace and Andy Pforzheimer, our co-Chief Executive Officers, and Greg Golkin, our President, are managing members of our sponsor. Consequently, Messrs. Pace, Pforzheimer and Golkin may be deemed to beneficially own the shares held by our sponsor and share voting and dispositive control over such securities. Each of Messrs. Pace, Pforzheimer and Golkin disclaims beneficial ownership of any shares other than to the extent he may have a pecuniary interest therein, directly or indirectly. Each of our other officers and directors are non-managing members of our sponsor. (4) Based on a Schedule 13G/A filed with the SEC on November 10, 2022 by Karpus Management, Inc., d/b/a Karpus Investment Management Karpus ), which is a registered investment adviser under Section 203 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Karpus is controlled by City of London Investment Group plc CLIG ), which is listed on the London Stock Exchange. However, in accordance with SEC Release No. 34-39538 (January 12, 1998), effective informational barriers have been established between Karpus and CLIG such that voting and investment power over the subject securities is exercised by Karpus independently of CLIG, and, accordingly, attribution of beneficial ownership is not required between Karpus and CLIG. The public shares reported in the Schedule 13G/A are owned directly by the accounts managed by Karpus. Karpus beneficially owns 1,242,398 shares of Class A common stock, though has the power to vote or direct the vote of 1,092,398 shares. The number of public shares held by Karpus is reported as of December 31, 2022, as stated in the Schedule 13G/A, which does not reflect any redemption of shares by Karpus in connection with the Extension Special Meeting or any other transactions after December 31, 2022. Accordingly, the number of public shares and the percentages set forth in the table may not reflect Karpus current beneficial ownership. The address of the principal business office of Karpus is 183 Sully-s Trail, Pittsford, New York, NY 14534. (5) Based on a Form 3 filed with the SEC on December 23, 2022, by Polar Asset Management Partners Inc. Polar ), which serves as investment advisor to Polar Multi-Strategy Master Fund, a Cayman Islands exempted company PMSMF ), and has sole voting and investment discretion with respect to the public shares that are held by PMSMF. Polar disclaims beneficial ownership of these securities and filed the Form 3 due to the redemption of 24,673,073 shares of A Common Stock in connection with the Extension Special Meeting, after which, Polar s aggregate beneficial ownership was above 10 of the Class A Common Stock. Our sponsor and our officers and directors are deemed to be our promoters as such term is defined under the federal securities laws. See Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions for additional information regarding our relationships with our promoters. Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans None. Changes in Control For more information on the Quality Gold Business Combination, please see Item 1. Business . Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. In August 2020, our sponsor subscribed to purchase 5,750,000 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of 25,000. Prior to the initial investment in the Company of 25,000 by our sponsor, we had no assets, tangible or intangible. On January 7, 2021, we effected a stock dividend of 1.2 shares for each share of Class B common stock outstanding, resulting in our initial stockholders holding an aggregate of 6,900,000 founder shares. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such founder shares would represent 20 of the outstanding shares upon completion of our initial public offering. The founder shares (including the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise thereof) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder. Our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 8,700,000 private placement warrants for a purchase price of 1.00 per warrant in a private placement simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering. As such, our sponsor s interest in our initial public offering was valued at 8,700,000. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The private placement warrants (including the warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans and the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder. There are no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our founder shares or warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination by the end of the Combination Period.

 Our anchor investor, an unaffiliated qualified institutional buyer (who is also not affiliated with our sponsor or any member of our management team), purchased 2,980,000 units in our initial public offering. In addition, our sponsor entered into a letter agreement with the anchor investor pursuant to which the anchor investor purchased membership interests in our sponsor representing an indirect beneficial interest in 100,000 founder shares and 100,000 warrants for an aggregate purchase price of 200,000. The founder shares and warrants held by the anchor investor are the same in all material respects as the founder shares and private placement warrants held by our sponsor. Pursuant to the letter agreement with our sponsor, the anchor investor has not been granted any material additional stockholder or other rights and was only issued membership interests in our sponsor with no right to control our sponsor or vote or dispose of the founder shares or private placement warrants, as applicable (which will continue to be held by our sponsor until following our initial business combination). Further, the anchor investor is not required to: (i) hold any units, shares of common stock or warrants it purchased in our initial public offering or thereafter for any amount of time, (ii) vote any shares of common stock it may beneficially own at the applicable time in favor of our business combination or (iii) refrain from exercising its right to redeem its shares of common stock included in the units purchased in our initial public offering at the time of our initial business combination. The purchases by the anchor investor of units in our initial public offering or our securities in the open market (or both) could potentially allow such investor to assert influence over us, including with respect to our initial business combination. Additionally, as a result of the founder shares and warrants that the anchor investor may hold (directly or indirectly), it may have different interests with respect to a vote on an initial business combination than other public stockholders. No assurances can be given as to the amount of our securities the anchor investor may retain or purchase following our initial public offering at any time prior to or upon the consummation of our initial business combination. If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she has honored and will continue to honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations to other entities that may take priority over their duties to us. Other than the payment to our sponsor of 10,000 per month described below, no compensation of any kind, including finder s and consulting fees, has been or will be paid by us to our sponsor, officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection with the completion of an initial business combination. Our audit committee reviews on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by us to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates and determines which expenses and the amount of expenses that need to be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf. Since January 7, 2021, we have paid our sponsor a total of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. Prior to the closing of our initial public offering, our sponsor agreed to loan us a loan of up to 300,000 pursuant to the IPO Promissory Note to be used for a portion of the expenses of our initial public offering. The IPO Promissory Note was non-interest bearing, unsecured and was due at the earlier of March 31, 2021 and the closing of our initial public offering. The value of our sponsor s interest in the initial public offering corresponds to the principal amount outstanding under any such loan. The IPO Promissory Note was repaid upon the closing of our initial public offering out of the offering proceeds not held in the trust account. In addition, in order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us Working Capital Loans. If we complete our initial business combination, we may repay any such Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay any such Working Capital Loans but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

 After our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us, if any, may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, furnished to our stockholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a stockholder meeting held to consider our initial business combination, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation. Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive (i) their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we have not completed our initial business combination by the end of the Combination Period, or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity and (iii) their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them as a result of any liquidation of the Company, although they will be entitled to redemption rights and liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination by the end of the Combination Period. If we submit our initial business combination to our public stockholders for a vote, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted by the stockholders at a duly held stockholders meeting are voted to approve the initial business combination. We have entered into a registration rights agreement with respect to the founder shares, private placement warrants, and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of any Working Capital Loans (and their respective component securities) and the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the foregoing and upon conversion of the founder shares. On March 22, 2022, we entered into the March Sponsor Working Capital Loan with the sponsor in the amount of 150,000, pursuant to which we received proceeds of 150,000. The March Sponsor Working Capital Loan is non-interest bearing and payable upon the earlier of (i) completion of the initial business combination or (ii) the date our winding up is effective. The unpaid principal balance on the March Sponsor Working Capital Loan may be convertible into warrants at the option of the sponsor at a price of 1.00 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. As of December 31, 2022, the total amount drawn on the March Sponsor Working Capital Loan was 150,000. On July 21, 2022, we entered into the July Working Capital Loan, a separate working capital loan with the sponsor in the amount of 375,000. The July Working Capital Loan matures on the earliest to occur of (i) the date on which we consummate our initial business combination and (ii) the date that our winding up is effective. The promissory note in connection with the July Working Capital Loan is convertible into warrants at 1.00 per warrant on terms identical to those of the private placement warrants. On July 21, 2022, we drew 370,000 from the promissory note, which has not yet been repaid as of December 31, 2022. On December 9, 2022, the Company issued the Second Promissory Note in the principal amount of up to 1,000,000 to the Sponsor. The Second Promissory Note was issued in connection with advances the Sponsor has made, and may make in the future, to the Company for working capital expenses. The loan is non-interest bearing and payable upon the earlier of (i) completion of the Initial Business Combination or (ii) the date the winding up of the Company is effective. December 9, 2022, the Company drew 86,100 from the Second Promissory Note, which has not yet been repaid as of December 31, 2022. For more information on the agreements entered into in connection with the Quality Gold Business Combination, please see Item 1. Business.

 Director Independence Nasdaq listing standards require that a majority of our board of directors be independent. An independent director is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the company s board of directors, would interfere with the director s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our board of directors has determined that Hal Rosser, Rick Federico, Starlette Johnson and Andy Heyer are independent directors as defined in Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present. Item 14 . Principal Accountant Fees and Services. The following is a summary of fees paid or to be paid to Marcum, for services rendered. 

Year Ended Year Ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Audit Fees 115,226 155,025 Audit Related Fees Tax Fees 17,510 8,500 All Other Fees Total 132,736 163,525 Audit Fees Audit fees consist of fees for professional services rendered for the audit of our year-end financial statements and services that are normally provided by Marcum in connection with regulatory filings. The aggregate fees of Marcum for professional services rendered for the audit of our annual financial statements, review of the financial information included in our Forms 10-Q for the respective periods and other required filings with the SEC for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 totaled approximately 115,226 and 155,025, respectively. The above amounts include interim procedures and audit fees, as well as attendance at audit committee meetings. Audit-Related Fees Audit-related fees consist of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under Audit Fees. These services include attest services that are not required by statute or regulation and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not pay Marcum any audit-related fees. Tax Fees Tax fees consist of fees billed for tax planning services and tax advice for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. All Other Fees We did not pay Marcum for any other services for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Pre-Approval Policy Our audit committee was formed upon the consummation of our initial public offering. As a result, the audit committee did not pre-approve all of the foregoing services, although any services rendered prior to the formation of our audit committee were approved by our board of directors. Since the formation of our audit committee, and on a going-forward basis, the audit committee has and will pre-approve all auditing services and permitted non-audit services to be performed for us by our auditors, including the fees and terms thereof (subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in the Exchange Act which are approved by the audit committee prior to the completion of the audit).

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Tastemaker Acquisition Corp Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Tastemaker Acquisition Corp. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Explanatory Paragraph Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company s mandatory liquidation date is July 12, 2023 and the Company s cash and working capital as of December 31, 2022 are not sufficient to complete its planned activities for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance date of the financial statements. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern as further described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit s to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit s we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Marcum LLP We have served as the Company s auditor since 2020. March 29, 2023

Amendment to Certificate of Incorporation On December 12, 2022, the Company filed an amendment (the Extension Amendment to the Company s Certificate of Incorporation (the Second Amended Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Extension Amendment extends the date by which the Company must consummate its Initial Business Combination from January 12, 2023 on a monthly basis to July 12, 2023. On December 12, 2022, the Company convened a special meeting of stockholders (the Special Meeting ). At the close of business on the record date of the Special Meeting, there were Public Shares and Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5), each of which was entitled to vote with respect to the Extension Amendment proposal. Holders of a total of Public Shares and Founder Shares, representing approximately of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, were present in person or by proxy, constituting a quorum. The stockholders of the Company voted on a proposal to amend the Certificate of Incorporation to extend the date by which the Company must consummate an Initial Business Combination from January 12, 2022 on a monthly basis to July 12, 2023. Stockholders holding shares of Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account. As a result, approximately million (approximately per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such redeeming holders, and approximately million (approximately per share) remained in the Trust Account. Indemnity In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (1) per Public Share or (2) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay the Company s taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. Going Concern Consideration As of December 31, 2022, the Company had in cash held outside of the Trust Account and a working capital deficit of (excluding income tax payable, franchise tax payable, and the deferred tax liability).

 from the sale of the Founder Shares, and a loan of under an unsecured and non-interest bearing promissory note (see Note 6). Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company s liquidity was and will be satisfied through the net proceeds from the Private Placement held outside of the Trust Account and proceeds from the Sponsor Working Capital Loans (as defined in Note 5). The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans. The Company anticipates that the cash held outside of the Trust Account as of December 31, 2022, will not be sufficient to allow the Company to operate until July 12, 2023, the date at which the Company must complete an Initial Business Combination, which is less than one year from the issuance of the financial statements. Management plans to address this uncertainty through the Initial Business Combination as discussed above. There is no assurance that the Company s plans to consummate an Initial Business Combination will be successful or successful within the Combination Period. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If an Initial Business Combination is not consummated by July 12, 2023, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Risks and Uncertainties The United States and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the escalation of geopolitical tensions and the recent invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022. In response to such invasion, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO deployed additional military forces to eastern Europe, and the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and other countries have announced various sanctions and restrictive actions against Russia, Belarus and related individuals and entities, including the removal of certain financial institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) payment system. Certain countries, including the United States, have also provided and may continue to provide military aid or other assistance to Ukraine during the ongoing military conflict, increasing geopolitical tensions with Russia. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the resulting measures that have been taken, and could be taken in the future, by NATO, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and other countries have created global security concerns that could have a lasting impact on regional and global economies. Although the length and impact of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine is highly unpredictable, the conflict could lead to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain interruptions. Additionally, Russian military actions and the resulting sanctions could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets and lead to instability and lack of liquidity in capital markets. In addition, the recent invasion of Ukraine by Russia, and the impact of sanctions against Russia and the potential for retaliatory acts from Russia, could result in increased cyber-attacks against U.S. companies. Any of the above mentioned factors, or any other negative impact on the global economy, capital markets or other geopolitical conditions resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions, could adversely affect the Company s search for an Initial Business Combination and any target business with which the Company may ultimately consummate an Initial Business Combination. The extent and duration of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, resulting sanctions and any related market disruptions are impossible to predict, but could be substantial, particularly if current or new sanctions continue for an extended period of time or if geopolitical tensions result in expanded military operations on a global scale. Any such disruptions may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the Risk Factors section of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K. If these disruptions or other matters of global concern continue for an extensive period of time, the Company s ability to consummate an Initial Business Combination, or the operations of a target business with which the Company may ultimately consummate an Initial Business Combination, may be materially adversely affected. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act was signed into federal law, which, among other things, imposes a 1 excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased by a domestic corporation beginning in 2023, with certain exceptions (the Excise Tax ). Because the Company is a Delaware corporation, it will be a covered corporation within the meaning of the IR Act, and while not free from doubt, it is possible that, unless an exemption is available, the Company (or any post-combination company) will be subject to the Excise Tax as a result of any redemptions by the Company of its common stock that occurs after December 31, 2022, including redemptions in connection with an Initial Business Combination. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the Excise Tax in connection with an Initial Business Combination would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the

The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the same to become effective within 60 business days following its Initial Business Combination and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. Notwithstanding the above, if the Company s Class A common stock is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of public warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but the Company will be required to use its best efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available.

Private Placement Warrants The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units being sold in the Initial Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants and the Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants will not be transferable, assignable or salable until days after the completion of an Initial Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis and be non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees.

 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of warrant exercise is sent to the warrant agent. The reason that the Company has agreed that these warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the Sponsor, or its permitted transferees is because it is not known at this time whether they will be affiliated with us following the Initial Business Combination. If they remain affiliated with the Company, their ability to sell the Company s securities in the open market will be significantly limited. The Company expects to have policies in place that prohibit insiders from selling the Company s securities except during specific periods of time. Even during such periods of time when insiders will be permitted to sell the Company s securities, an insider cannot trade in the Company s securities if he or she is in possession of material non-public information. Accordingly, unlike public stockholders who could sell the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants freely in the open market, the insiders could be significantly restricted from doing so. As a result, the Company believes that allowing the holders to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis is appropriate. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants outstanding. The Company accounts for the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC Topic 815-40. Such guidance provides that because the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each warrant must be recorded as a liability. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments required that the Company record the warrants as derivative liabilities at fair value upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. The Public Warrants were allocated a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Units equal to its fair value. The warrant liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liabilities are adjusted to current fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the Company s statements of operations. The Company will reassess the classification at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the warrants will be reclassified as of the date of the event that causes the reclassification. shares of par value preferred stock. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding. Class A common stock The Company is authorized to issue up to shares of Class A common stock with a par value of per share. Holders of the Company s Class A common stock are entitled to for each share. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were and shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding , including and shares of Class A common stock subject to possible redemption, respectively. Class B common stock The Company is authorized to issue up to shares of Class B common stock with a par value of per share. Holders of Class B common stock are entitled to for each share. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding. Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will vote together as a single class on all other matters submitted to a vote of stockholders except as required by law. Prior to an Initial Business Combination, holders of Class B common stock will have the right to elect all of the Company s directors and may remove members of the board of directors for any reason. The Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of an Initial Business Combination, or earlier at the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like, and subject to further adjustment. In the case that additional shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities are issued or deemed issued in connection with an Initial Business Combination, the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all Founder Shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, of the total number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding after such conversion (after giving effect to any redemptions of shares of Class A common stock by public stockholders), including the total number of shares of Class A
