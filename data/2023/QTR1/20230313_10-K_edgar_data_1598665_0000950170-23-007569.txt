In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Consequently, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.

 Item 1. Business 
 Our Business 
 Heritage Insurance Holdings, Inc. we , our , us , Heritage and the Company is a super-regional property and casualty insurance holding company that primarily provides personal and commercial residential insurance through our insurance company subsidiaries. We are vertically integrated and control or manage substantially all aspects of insurance underwriting, customer service, actuarial analysis, distribution and claims processing and adjusting. We are led by a highly experienced and diverse management team with significant expertise in the residential property insurance industry and deep industry relationships. 
 Our insurance subsidiaries include: 
 
 Heritage Property Casualty Insurance Company Heritage P C ), which provides personal and commercial residential property insurance and commercial general liability insurance; 

Narragansett Bay Insurance Company NBIC ), which provides personal and commercial residential property insurance; and 

Zephyr Insurance Company Zephyr ), which provides personal residential and wind-only property insurance in Hawaii. 

Our financial strength ratings are important in establishing our competitive position and can significantly impact our ability to write policies. We are rated by both Demotech, Inc. Demotech and Kroll Bond Rating Agency KBRA ). Demotech, a rating agency specializing in evaluating the financial stability of insurers, maintains a letter-scale financial stability rating system FSR from A (A double prime) to L (licensed by insurance regulatory authorities). KBRA s ratings assigned to insurance companies ranges from AAA (extremely strong operations to no risk) to R (operating under regulatory supervision). 
 Demotech and KBRA have assigned the following insurance financial strength ratings IFSR to our key operating subsidiaries.

 We also provide insurance and insurance-related services through the following operating subsidiaries: 
 
 Osprey Re Ltd. Osprey ), our captive reinsurance subsidiary that may provide a portion of the reinsurance protection purchased by our insurance company subsidiaries; 

Heritage MGA, LLC, our managing general agent; 

NBIC Service Company, which provides services to NBIC; 

Contractors Alliance Network, LLC CAN ), our vendor network manager for claims and provider of restoration, emergency and recovery services; and 

Skye Lane Properties, LLC, our property management subsidiary. 

Our Company 
 Our primary products are personal and commercial residential property insurance. On an admitted basis, we provide personal residential insurance in fourteen eastern and gulf states and commercial residential insurance in three of those states. We also write personal residential insurance on an admitted basis in Hawaii and on an excess and surplus lines basis in California and Florida. We are licensed, but inactive, in Pennsylvania. 
 We conduct our operations under one business and reporting segment.

As of December 31, 2022, we had 514,924 personal residential policies in force, representing 1.1 billion of annualized premium, 2,756 commercial residential policies in force, representing 154.6 million of annualized premium, and 12,227 commercial general liability policies in force, representing 11.0 million of annualized premium, for a total of 529,907 policies and 1.3 billion of annualized premium. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had gross premiums written of 1.3 billion and an operating loss of 157.4 million. The operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 included a non-cash, mostly non-deductible goodwill impairment charge of 92.0 million. At December 31, 2022, we had total assets of 2.4 billion and total stockholders equity of 131.0 million. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our overall short-term strategy has shifted from growing premiums to rebalancing our portfolio of over 1 billion in gross written premium to optimize our portfolio toward products and geographies that maximize long term returns to our shareholders, while mitigating risk from a single or series of catastrophic weather events. We intend to improve underwriting results by undertaking the following: 
 Improve the Profitability of our Portfolio 
 We believe that our goal to improve the profitability of our business will be achieved through disciplined underwriting, diversification of our book of business, and rate adequacy, as well as a robust reinsurance program. More selective underwriting has led to an intentional decline in policy count for our admitted personal lines product while achieving a higher average premium per policy through rate actions. Given our coastal exposure, which includes exposure to hurricanes and other severe weather events, our reinsurance program provides meaningful balance sheet protection and reduces earnings volatility. We continue to take underwriting and rate actions to improve the profitability of our business and continuously monitor our portfolio to manage the risk of wind and other perils. 
 Optimize Our Reinsurance Program 
 We continue to strategically evaluate our reinsurance program to obtain what we believe to be the most appropriate levels and sources of reinsurance, and we trade with high quality reinsurers who are either rated or who collateralize our risk transfer. Our reinsurance program includes excess of loss, quota share, per risk and facultative coverage. We believe there is sufficient capital to support our reinsurance program and that we have an opportunity to obtain reasonable pricing and contract terms and conditions. We continue to evaluate cost-efficient alternatives to traditional reinsurance, such as the issuance of catastrophe bonds by Citrus Re Ltd. Citrus Re ), a Bermuda special purpose insurer. In addition, each year we evaluate whether to meet a portion of our reinsurance needs through the use of our reinsurance subsidiary, Osprey, which helps to manage our reinsurance expense and reduces our reliance on third-party reinsurance. 
 Efficiently Manage Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses 
 We are committed to proactively managing our loss costs through prudent underwriting and in-sourcing critical aspects of claims adjusting and remediation services. We have over 300 full-time employees dedicated to claims management. This includes personnel who in take claim information an in-house insurance defense team, claims examiners, and claims vendor management and mediation personnel. We have additional contracted claims adjusting and loss mitigation resources in all states in which we conduct business and deploy those additional resources as needed. Our CAN subsidiary provides emergency claims and mitigation services to our policyholders. We believe our significant internal and external resources allow us to deliver timely service to our policyholders and effectively manage claims costs. 
 Expand and Cultivate Relationships with Large Independent Agencies 
 As described in our competitive strengths below, we believe that continuing to expand and cultivate our relationships with large independent agencies and other stakeholders will foster a higher quality book of business. We have also established relationships with auto insurance carriers who package their auto product with our residential property insurance product to provide diversification opportunities. 
 Develop IT Solutions to More Effectively Service our Customers 
 We continuously work to enhance our technology resources in order to better serve our agents and policyholders, streamline our processes and improve efficiency. We have made it a priority to transition each of our insurance companies to the same policy and claims system, which provides efficiencies for our personnel as well as our agency networks. 
 Our Competitive Strengths 
 We believe that our business diversification to date and our ability to capitalize on our future business prospects are a result of the following competitive strengths of our business: 
 4 

Experienced Management Team With a Long History in the Residential Property Insurance Market 
 We have an experienced executive management team led by Ernesto Garateix, Chief Executive Officer, Kirk Lusk, Chief Financial Officer and a highly experienced and diverse senior management team with significant expertise in the residential property insurance industry and deep industry relationships. Our former President, Richard Widdicombe, who serves as Chairman of the Board also has extensive experience in and an in-depth knowledge of the insurance industry. 
 Strong, Conservative Capital Structure 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had stockholders equity of 131.0 million and Heritage P C, NBIC and Zephyr, had policyholder surplus, as defined by statutory accounting principles, of 106.7 million, 89.6 million and 80.0 million, respectively. The surplus for each of our insurance subsidiaries is well in excess of the minimum capital levels required by our insurance regulators and Demotech. 
 Selective Underwriting and Policy Acquisition Criteria 
 We believe our proprietary data analytics capabilities and underwriting processes allow us to make better risk selections leading to profitability and high levels of policy retention. Our data analytics are embedded in the underwriting process and are used for strategic expansion into new product lines and states. 
 Unique Claims Servicing Model and Superior Customer Service 
 We believe that the vertical integration of our claims adjusting, water mitigation, and repair services provides us with a competitive advantage. Through our management of both claims adjusting and repair services, we are less reliant on third parties and are generally able to begin the adjustment and mitigation process in a timely manner, which helps manage our loss costs. We also believe our unique model provides a superior level of customer service for our policyholders, enhancing our reputation and increasing the likelihood that our policyholders will renew their policies with us. 
 Relationships with Highly Rated Reinsurers 
 We manage our exposure to catastrophic events through, among other things, the purchase of reinsurance. Our relationships with highly rated reinsurers have been developed as a result of our management team s industry experience and our reputation for selective underwriting and effective claims management. Our financial strength, underwriting results and the long-term relationships between our management team and our reinsurance partners help improve the cost-effectiveness of our reinsurance program. 
 Relationships with Independent Agents and National Underwriters 
 We have developed relationships with a large network of independent insurance agents. We have partnerships with certain large retail agencies which amplify our production. We believe we have been able to build this network due to our financial stability, disciplined underwriting, claims and mitigation capabilities, customer service, and robust reinsurance program. We have forged strategic relationships with national insurers and agencies that provides us access to their agent and production networks. The Products and Distribution section below describes the breadth of our agency network. 
 ESG Strategy 
 The advancement of the environmental, social and governance ESG framework is intended to promote awareness, sustainable and inclusive development of insurance markets which has been an area of focus for standard setters and regulatory agencies at the state and federal level. We continue to progress in integrating ESG strategies into our business and operations. Specifically: 
 Environment - we are currently focused on becoming more energy efficient, mitigating and adapting to climate change, conserving water and reducing waste. 

Social we have put emphasis on creating an inclusive equal opportunity workplace and inspiring employees to support community relations. 

Governance we are committed in our pursuit to create an ethical and transparent organization. 

We continue to enhance our ESG policies as we assess, analyze and identify critical topics. We continue to monitor the expansion of these policies to ensure compliance with future regulations and seek to implement best practices in response to any emerging guidance. 
 Our Competition 
 The market for residential property insurance is highly competitive in the states in which we conduct business. We primarily compete against single state or regional carriers, but also compete to varying degrees against large national carriers and state-sponsored homeowners insurance entities. We compete for business on the basis of price, financial strength, types of coverages 
 5 

offered, availability of coverage desired by customers, commission structure and quality of service. We believe Heritage differentiates itself from many competitors with our service levels, financial resources, including a robust reinsurance program, streamlined processes, and vertical integration of loss mitigation and repair services. We've consistently ranked in the top 25 writers of homeowners insurance business nationwide. Our market share by state varies depending upon our premium volume and that of competing property insurance writers in those states. 
 Products and Distribution 
 Heritage P C writes voluntary personal residential insurance policies through a network of more than 2,000 independent agents in the states in which it is licensed. Approximately 28 of our voluntary personal lines policies are written by agents that are affiliated with eight large agency networks with which we have entered into master agency agreements. We market and write commercial residential policies through a network of approximately 400 independent agents in Florida. 
 NBIC writes personal lines policies through a network of retail independent agents, wholesale agents and a partnership with a large direct agency. We maintain master agency agreements with approximately 500 retail independent agents, representing over 800 agency locations, including several large agency networks. We also distribute indirectly to over 1,500 retail locations through eight wholesale agency relationships. Our three largest independent agency relationships represent 15.6 of annualized premiums. Additionally, we have expanded our product offering to include commercial residential products in New Jersey and New York. 
 Zephyr writes personal and commercial insurance policies through a network of approximately 70 independent agencies in Hawaii. Approximately 50.6 of our premium is written by agents that are affiliated with three large agency networks with which we have entered into master agency agreements. 
 Our Markets 
 The following charts depict the geographic distribution of our in-force premium as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our Florida personal lines in-force premium has declined as part of our strategy to re-allocate capital to products and geographies that maximize long-term returns.

 CGL = commercial general liability 
 CRES = commercial residential insurance 
 PRES = personal residential insurance 
 Underwriting 
 Our management establishes underwriting criteria for policies we accept. For consistency, efficiency, and compliance with our underwriting standards, our underwriting process is generally automated with our predetermined criteria programmed into our policy system. Certain policies have characteristics which require an independent review by our underwriters. Our underwriters evaluate and accept only those risks that they believe will enable us to achieve an underwriting profit. To achieve underwriting profitability on a consistent basis, we focus on (1) the suitability of the risk to be assumed or written, (2) the adequacy of the premium with regard to the risk to be assumed or written and (3) the geographic distribution of existing risk relative to the risk to be assumed or written. 
 All of our underwriting is performed internally. The underwriting team includes actuarial staff, underwriters, our risk management team, and product development personnel. Our underwriting team leverages our proprietary data analytics, which include 
 6 

a number of automated processes, to analyze a number of risk evaluation factors, including the age, construction, location and value of the residence, premiums to be received from insuring the residence, geographic concentrations of policies and the cost of reinsurance. The underwriting criteria that we consider continues to evolve with our business and strategy. 
 We also review our expiring policies to determine if those risks continue to meet our underwriting guidelines. If a given policy no longer meets our criteria, we will take appropriate action, including raising rates, or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, not offering to renew the policy. 
 Policy Administration 
 We utilize web-based software solutions and insurance personnel to perform policy administration services, including processing, billing and policy maintenance. The software is able to adapt to a variety of forms and rates, handle the administration of our policy volume, and provides detailed information about our book of business to our internal underwriters so that they can adjust our underwriting criteria, as necessary. The systems also allow us to provide renewal notices, late payment notices, cancellation notices, endorsements and policies to our customers on a timely basis. 
 Claims Administration 
 We closely manage all aspects of the claims process, from processing the initial claim submission to providing remediation services for claims through our wholly-owned subsidiary, CAN, or preferred vendors. Claims from policyholders are reviewed by our managers and staff adjusters, who assess the extent of the loss, which may include thorough on-site investigations, and determine the resources needed to adjust each claim. Our claims are generally adjusted by our staff claims professionals, except in the case of a catastrophic event for which we have contracted with several large national claims adjusting firms and experienced independent contractors to assist our adjusters with the increased volume of claims to ensure timely responses to our policyholders. Our CAN subsidiary performs both catastrophe and non-catastrophe related repair and remediation services. We believe our approach to claims handling results in a higher level of customer service and reduces our losses and loss adjustment expense. 
 To encourage our Florida policyholders to allow us to manage their claims from beginning to end, we developed a program that provides participating customers with a 10 discount on their claim deductible, and gives us control over inspection, claims adjusting and repair services. 
 Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves 
 Our liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses represents our estimated ultimate liability of (i) claims that have been incurred and reported, but not yet paid (case reserves), (ii) claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us IBNR ), and (iii) loss adjustment expenses LAE which are intended to cover the cost of settling claims, including investigation and defense of lawsuits resulting from such claims. 
 Considerable time can pass between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss, and the payment of that loss. Our liability for losses and LAE, which we believe represents the best estimate at a given point in time based on facts, circumstances and historical trends then known, may necessarily be adjusted to reflect additional facts that become available during the loss settlement period. We continually review and adjust our estimated losses as necessary based on industry development trends, evolving claims experience and new information obtained. 
 For a discussion and summary of the activity in the liability for losses and LAE for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, Refer to Note 13 Reserve for Unpaid Losses to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Technology 
 Technology has become an integral part of our organization and makes us more efficient, cost-effective and customer-centric. Our business depends upon the development, implementation and use of integrated technology systems to automate various processes such as underwriting, claims processing, billing and customer service. This leads to improved efficiency, reduced errors and faster turnaround times. These systems have enabled us to offer more personalized experience and better service to both our agents as well as our customers. Our technology platform has streamlined our various business processes making them faster and more efficient across our multi-state insurance business. The technology platform is supported by a robust enterprise data warehouse and analytics platform that provides key performance indicator measurements and actionable insights for our management, at the same time supporting all of our regulatory compliance reporting needs. 
 We license policy, billing and claims administration and catastrophe modeling software from third parties. We also own or license other technology systems used by our insurance company affiliates. Many of our technology platforms run on cloud-based solutions, and some run on servers hosted in a data center. All of our platforms are resilient and have disaster recovery backups.

Reinsurance 
 In order to limit our potential exposure to individual risks and catastrophic events, we purchase significant reinsurance from third party reinsurers. Purchasing reinsurance is an important part of our risk strategy, and premiums ceded to reinsurers is one of our largest costs. Reinsurance involves transferring, or ceding , a portion of the risk exposure on policies we write to another insurer, known as a reinsurer. To the extent that our reinsurers are unable to meet the obligations they assume under our reinsurance agreements, we remain liable for the entire insured loss. 
 We have strong relationships with reinsurers, which we attribute to our management s industry experience, disciplined underwriting, and claims management capabilities. For each of the twelve months beginning June 1, 2022 and 2021, we purchased reinsurance from the following sources: (i) the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, a state-mandated catastrophe fund FHCF for Florida admitted market policies only, (ii) private reinsurers, all of which were rated A- or higher by A.M. Best Company, Inc. A.M. Best or Standard Poor s Financial Services LLC S P or were fully collateralized, and (iii) our captive reinsurance subsidiary, Osprey. We also sponsored catastrophe bonds in 2022 through Citrus Re. In addition to purchasing excess of loss catastrophe reinsurance, we also purchased quota share, property per risk and facultative reinsurance. Our quota share programs limit our exposure on catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses and provides ceding commission income. Our per risk programs limit our net exposure in the event of a severe non-catastrophe loss impacting a single location or risk. We also utilize facultative reinsurance to supplement our per risk reinsurance program where our capacity needs dictate. 
 Our reinsurance agreements are prospective contracts. We record an asset, prepaid reinsurance premiums, and a liability, reinsurance payable, for the entire contract amount upon commencement of our new reinsurance agreements. We generally amortize our catastrophe reinsurance premiums over the 12-month contract period beginning on June 1 on a straight-line basis. Our quota share reinsurance is amortized over the 12-month contract period and may be purchased on a calendar or fiscal year basis. 
 Our insurance regulators require all insurance companies, like us, to have a certain amount of capital and reinsurance coverage in order to cover losses and loss adjustment expenses upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event. Our reinsurance program provides reinsurance in excess of our state regulator requirements, which are based on the probable maximum loss that we would incur from an individual catastrophic event estimated to occur once in every 100 years based on our portfolio of insured risks. The nature, severity and location of the event giving rise to such a probable maximum loss differs for each insurer depending on the insurer s portfolio of insured risks, including, among other things, the geographic concentration of insured value within such portfolio. As a result, a particular catastrophic event could be a one-in-100-year loss event for one insurance company while having a greater or lesser probability of occurrence for another insurance company. We also purchase reinsurance coverage to protect against the potential for multiple catastrophic events occurring in the same year. We share portions of our reinsurance program coverage among our insurance company affiliates. 
 We are responsible for all losses and loss adjustment expenses in excess of our reinsurance program. For second or subsequent catastrophic events, our total available coverage depends on the magnitude of the first event, as we may have coverage remaining from layers that were not previously fully exhausted. In the fourth quarter of 2022 we re-estimated our ultimate losses for Hurricane Irma, which struck Florida in 2017. As a result of that re-estimation, Heritage has exhausted the private layers of reinsurance specific to Hurricane Irma but has a 45 participation in the FHCF limit remaining. Accordingly, should future re-estimations to Hurricane Irma losses increase the expected loss reserves, a portion of the increase will be retained and a portion will be ceded to the FHCF. 
 For the contract period ending May 31, 2023, our insurance company subsidiaries purchased catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance from the following sources: (i) FHCF (i.e., Florida residential admitted market risks only), (ii) over 50 third-party private reinsurers, all of which were rated A- or higher by A.M. Best or S P or which were fully collateralized, (iii) Osprey Re, our captive reinsurance subsidiary, and (iv) Citrus Re. There is no single reinsurer representing more than 10 of the limit purchased for our program other than the FHCF.

Investments 
 Our investments are managed by third-party asset managers. We have designed our investment policy to provide a balance between current yield, conservation of capital and the liquidity requirements of our operations. As such, our invested assets are primarily held in cash and bonds of high credit quality with relatively short durations. Our investment policy sets guidelines that provide for a well-diversified investment portfolio that is compliant with insurance regulations applicable to the states in which we operate. Our investment objectives include liquidity, safety and security of principal, and returns. The investment policy limits investments in common and preferred stocks and requires a minimum weighted average portfolio quality of A for our bond portfolio with an overall duration of three to five years. No more than 2 of admitted assets can be invested in any one issuer, with slightly higher limits for highly rated securities, excluding government-related securities. Investments in commercial mortgages cannot exceed 10 of admitted assets. Prohibited investments include short sales and margin purchases, oil, gas, mineral or other types of leases, speculative uses of futures and options, unrated corporate securities, non-US denominated securities, convertible securities, high risk CMO instruments, repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions and speculative foreign currency valuation transactions. Our investment policy, which may change from time to time, is approved by our Investment Committee and is reviewed on a regular basis in order to ensure that our investment policy evolves in response to changes in the financial markets. Refer to Note 2 Investments to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we held 280.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and 653.6 million in investments, which were comprised of 635.6 million in fixed maturities, 1.5 million in common stock and 16.5 million in other invested assets. Of the 635.6 million of fixed maturities, 24.3 million of U.S. government agency securities were pledged to the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB in connection with a FHLB loan to Heritage P C. Refer to Note 14 Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Seasonality of our Business 
 Our insurance business is seasonal; hurricanes typically occur during the period from June 1 through November 30 and winter storms generally impact the first and fourth quarters, while hail and severe convective storms typically occur in the first and second quarters. Because our catastrophe reinsurance program incepts on June 1 annually, any variation in the cost of our reinsurance, whether due to changes to reinsurance rates or changes in the total insured value of our policy base, will be incurred over the twelve month period beginning with that date subject to certain adjustments. 
 Government Regulation 
 The insurance industry is extensively regulated. Our insurance company subsidiaries are subject to the laws and regulations of the states in which they conduct business. The insurance regulatory statutes and rules provide for regulation of virtually all aspects of the business of insurance companies. The states in which we conduct business, like many states, have adopted several model laws and regulations as promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC ). State statutes and administrative rules generally require each insurance company that is part of a holding company group to register with the department of insurance in its state of domicile and to furnish information concerning the operations of the companies within the holding company system which may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the group. As part of its registration, each insurance company must identify material agreements, relationships and transactions with affiliates, including without limitation loans, investments, asset transfers, transactions outside of the ordinary course of business, certain management, service, and cost sharing agreements, reinsurance transactions, dividends and consolidated tax allocation agreements. In some instances, individual state insurance laws and regulations are even more stringent than those promulgated by the NAIC or other states. 
 We are subject to regulations administered by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business. These regulations relate to, among other things: 
 the content and timing of required notices and other policyholder information; 

the amount of premiums the insurer may write in relation to its surplus (writing ratios); 

the amount and nature of reinsurance a company is required to purchase; 

participation in guaranty funds and other statutorily created markets or organizations; 

business operations and claims practices; 

approval of policy forms and premium rates; 

standards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements; 

licensing of insurers and their products; 

restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments; 

restrictions on the ability of insurance company subsidiaries to pay dividends to insurance holding companies; 

approval of and restrictions on transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates; 

10 

restrictions on the size of risks insurable under a single policy; 

requiring deposits for the benefit of policyholders; 

requiring certain methods of accounting; 

periodic examinations of our operations and finances; 

the form and content of records of financial condition required to be filed; and 

requiring reserves. 

Various regulatory and legislative bodies have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations to address the cyclical nature of the insurance industry, catastrophic events and insurance capacity and pricing. These regulations include (i) the creation of market assistance plans under which insurers are induced to provide certain coverages, (ii) restrictions on the ability of insurers to rescind or otherwise cancel certain policies in mid-term or to non-renew policies at their scheduled expirations, (iii) advance notice requirements or limitations imposed for certain policy non-renewals, (iv) limitations upon increases or decreases in rates permitted to be charged, (v) expansion of governmental involvement in the insurance market and (vi) increased regulation of insurers policy administration and claims handling practices. Further regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to impose fines, sanctions, and other penalties, and to deny or revoke licenses for various reasons, including the violation of regulations. In some instances, we follow practices based on our interpretations of regulations or practices that we believe may be generally followed by the industry. These practices may turn out to be different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us. 
 Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed under applicable state laws. The risk-based capital standards, based upon the Risk-Based Capital Model Act adopted by the NAIC, require our insurance subsidiaries to report the results of risk-based capital calculations to state regulators and the NAIC. These risk-based capital standards provide for different levels of regulatory attention depending upon the ratio of an insurance company s total adjusted capital, as calculated in accordance with NAIC guidelines, to its authorized control level risk-based capital. Authorized control level risk-based capital is determined using the NAIC s risk-based capital formula, which measures the minimum amount of capital that an insurance company needs to support its overall business operations. 
 The State of Florida Office of Insurance Regulation FLOIR imposed certain additional solvency related requirements as a condition of receiving a certificate of authority for our Florida insurance company subsidiary. Finally, our insurance company affiliates are subject to state regulations or consent orders setting conditions related to various transactions, including intercompany transactions. We are in full compliance with all consent orders. 
 State regulators where we are and may become licensed and offer insurance products conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports related to financial condition, holding company issues and other matters. These regulatory authorities also conduct periodic examinations into insurers business practices. Additionally, we are subject to assessments levied by governmental and quasi-governmental entities from the states in which we conduct business. 
 Human Capital 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 612 full-time and part-time employees. We do not have collective bargaining agreements relating to any of our associates. Our employees are our most valuable asset, and we are committed to building a workforce that supports each employee s unique professional journey. We believe having an inclusive work environment, which not only drives engagement but fosters innovation, is critical to driving growth. Our business results depend in part on our ability to successfully manage our human capital resources, including attracting, identifying and retaining key talent. We provide all employees a wide range of professional development experiences, both formal and informal. Our formal offerings include leadership development experiences, vocational training, and a certification program. Most training and courses are delivered virtually. 
 11 

We are committed to the health and safety of our employees, which is critical to our success. We provide our employees with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs. These programs are designed to support employees' physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors. We provide competitive compensation and benefits as well as a 401(k) plan with employee matching opportunities, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, telemedicine, paid time off, family leave, employee assistance programs and free education, training and development programs. 
 We are committed to the wellness of our employees and our community and as part of that commitment we have volunteer programs to support our local community s wellness which provides our employees paid time to volunteer to Heritage-sponsored volunteer opportunities.

Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 Set forth below are certain risk factors that could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. You should carefully read the following risk factors, together with the financial statements, related notes and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business, financial condition and operating results may suffer if any of the following risks are realized. If any of these risks or uncertainties occur, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that contain risks and uncertainties. Please Refer to the discussion of Forward-Looking Statements of this Annual Report in connection with your consideration of the risk factors and other important factors that may affect future results described herein. 
 Risks Related to Our Business 
 Our loss reserves are estimates and may be inadequate to cover our actual liability for losses, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected. 
 We maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses, also referred to as loss reserves. Our loss reserves are based primarily on our historical data and statistical projections of what we believe the resolution and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances then known to us. Our claims experience and our experience with the risks related to certain claims is inherently limited. We use company historical data to the extent it is available and rely on industry historical data which may not be indicative of future periods. As a result, our projections and our estimates may be inaccurate, which in turn may cause our actual losses to exceed our loss reserves. If our actual losses exceed our loss reserves, our financial results and our ability to expand our business and to compete in the property and casualty insurance industry may be negatively affected. 
 Factors that affect unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses include the estimates made on a claim-by-claim basis known as case reserves coupled with bulk estimates known as incurred but not yet reported (or IBNR ). Periodic estimates by management of the ultimate costs required to resolve all claims are based on our analysis of historical data and estimations of the impact of numerous factors such as (i) per claim information, (ii) industry and company historical loss experience and development patterns, (iii) legislative enactments, judicial decisions, legal developments in the awarding of damages and changes in political attitudes, and (iv) trends in general economic conditions, including the effects of inflation. Management revises its estimates based on the results of its analysis. This process assumes that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for estimating the ultimate resolution of all claims. There is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of the reserves because the eventual redundancy or deficiency is affected by multiple factors. 
 Because of the inherent uncertainties in the reserving process, we cannot be certain that our reserves will be adequate to cover our actual losses and loss adjustment expenses. If our reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are less than actual losses and loss adjustment expenses, we will be required to increase our reserves with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency is identified. Future loss experience substantially in excess of our reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses could substantially harm our results of operations and financial condition. 
 We have exposure to unpredictable catastrophes that are more pronounced because a large portion of our insurance business is conducted in coastal states, which exposure can materially and adversely affect our financial results. 
 We write insurance policies that cover homeowners, condominium owners and commercial residential buildings for losses that result from, among other things, catastrophes. We are therefore subject to losses, including claims under policies we have assumed or written, arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. A significant catastrophe, or a series of catastrophes, could also have an adverse effect on our reinsurers. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, severe convective storms, tropical storms, snowstorms, tornadoes, earthquakes, hailstorms, explosions, power outages, fires and by man-made events, such as terrorist attacks. Climate change, to the extent it produces extreme changes in temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could affect the frequency or severity of weather-related catastrophes. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected and the severity of the event. 
 As of December 31, 2022, nearly all of our premium in force related to business in coastal states, which are especially subject to adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes, tropical storms, earthquakes, and winter storms. A single catastrophic event, or a series of such events, destructive weather patterns, general economic trend, regulatory development or other condition specifically affecting the states in which we conduct business, particularly the more densely populated areas of those states, could have a disproportionately adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Therefore, although we attempt to manage our exposure to catastrophes through our underwriting process and the purchase of reinsurance protection, an especially severe catastrophe or series of catastrophes could exceed our reinsurance protection and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In the fourth quarter of 2022 we re-estimated our ultimate losses for Hurricane Irma, which struck Florida in 2017. As a result of that re-estimation, Heritage has exhausted the private layers of reinsurance specific to Hurricane Irma but has a 45 participation in the FHCF limit remaining Accordingly, should future re-estimations to Hurricane Irma losses increase the expected loss reserves, a portion of the increase will be retained and a portion will be ceded to the FHCF. In total, for the period from June 1, 2022 through May 31, 2023, we have purchased an aggregate limit of 3.2 billion of catastrophe reinsurance coverage for Heritage 
 13 

P C, Zephyr, and NBIC, for multiple catastrophic events. Our ability to access this coverage, however, is subject to the severity and frequency of such events. We may experience significant losses and loss adjustment expenses in excess of our retention or experience multiple retentions for a series of catastrophic events in a single season, which could materially and adversely affect our financial results. 
 Our success depends on our ability to adequately assess risk and set premiums accordingly, and our failure to do so could affect the growth of our business and adversely impact our financial results. 
 Our results of operations and financial condition depend on our ability to underwrite and set premium rates accurately for a wide variety of risks. Rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses, reinsurance costs and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit. In order to price our products accurately, we must collect and properly analyze a substantial amount of data; develop, test and apply appropriate rating formulas; closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends; and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy. Our ability to successfully perform these tasks, and as a result price our products accurately, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are outside our control, including: 
 the availability of sufficient reliable data and our ability to properly analyze available data; 

regulatory delays in approving filed rate changes; 

the uncertainties that inherently characterize estimates and assumptions; 

our selection and application of appropriate rating and pricing techniques; 

changes in legal standards, claim resolution practices, and restoration costs; and 

legislatively imposed consumer initiatives. 

In addition, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our profit margins. We could also overprice risks, which could reduce the number of policies we write and our competitiveness. In either event, our profitability could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Our results of operations may fluctuate significantly based on industry factors. 
 The insurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excess underwriting capacity, as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted an increase in pricing. As premium levels increase, there may be new entrants to the market, which could then lead to increased competition, a significant reduction in premium rates, less favorable policy terms and fewer opportunities to underwrite insurance risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. In addition to these considerations, changes in the frequency and severity of losses suffered by insureds and insurers, including changes resulting from multiple and/or catastrophic weather events, may affect the cycles of the insurance business significantly. We cannot predict whether market conditions will improve, remain constant or deteriorate. Negative market conditions may impair our ability to write insurance at rates that we consider appropriate relative to the risk assumed. If we cannot write insurance at appropriate rates, our business would be materially and adversely affected. 
 In addition, the uncertainties inherent in the reserving process, together with the potential for unforeseen developments, including changes in laws and the prevailing interpretation of policy terms, may result in losses and loss adjustment expenses materially different from the reserves initially established. Changes to prior year reserves will affect current underwriting results by increasing net income if the prior year reserves prove to be redundant or by decreasing net income if the prior year reserves prove to be insufficient. We may not record contingency reserves to account for expected future losses. As a result, we expect volatility in operating results in periods in which significant loss events occur because generally accepted accounting principles do not permit insurers or reinsurers to reserve for loss events until they have occurred and are expected to give rise to a claim. We anticipate that claims arising from future events may require the establishment of substantial reserves from time to time. 
 Reinsurance coverage may not be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at all. 
 The cost of reinsurance is subject to prevailing market conditions beyond our control such as the amount of capital in the reinsurance market, as well as the frequency and magnitude of natural and man-made catastrophes. Our total cost of obtaining reinsurance over the last few years has increased, both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of premiums-in-force, and is expected to continue to increase in the future. We cannot be assured that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us in the amounts we consider sufficient and at prices acceptable to us. As a result, we may determine to increase the amount of risk we retain or look for other alternatives to reinsurance, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 We may not be able to collect reinsurance amounts due to us from the reinsurers with which we have contracted. 
 14 

Reinsurance is a method of transferring part of an insurance company s risk under an insurance policy to another insurance company. To the extent that our reinsurers are unable to meet the obligations they assume under our reinsurance agreements, we remain liable for the entire insured loss. We use reinsurance arrangements to significantly limit and manage the amount of risk we retain, to stabilize our underwriting results, and to increase our underwriting capacity. Our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers under the reinsurance treaties we currently have in effect is subject to the reinsurance company s ability and willingness to pay and to meet its obligations to us. We attempt to select financially strong reinsurers with an A.M. Best or S P rating of A- or better or we require the reinsurer to fully collateralize its exposure. While we monitor from time to time their financial condition, we also rely on our reinsurance broker and rating agencies in evaluating our reinsurers ability to meet their obligations to us. 
 Our reinsurance coverage in any given year may be concentrated with one or a limited group of reinsurers. No single private market reinsurer represented more than 10 of the overall limit purchased from our total reinsurance coverage. Any failure on the part of any one reinsurance company to meet its obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 All residential insurance companies that write admitted business in Florida, including Heritage P C, are required to obtain reinsurance through the FHCF, and this coverage comprises a substantial portion of the Heritage P C reinsurance program for our Florida insured properties. The limit and retention of the FHCF coverage is subject to upward or downward adjustment based on, among other things, submitted exposures to FHCF by all participants. We have purchased private reinsurance alongside our FHCF layer to fill in gaps in coverage that may result from the adjustment of the limit or retention of our FHCF coverage; however, such reinsurance would not cover any losses we may incur as a result of FHCF s inability to pay the full amount of our claims. If a catastrophic event occurs in Florida, the FHCF may not have sufficient funds to pay all of its claims from insurance companies in full or in a timely manner. This could result in significant financial, legal and operational challenges to our Company. In the event of a catastrophic loss, the FHCF s ability to pay may be dependent upon its ability to issue bonds in amounts that would be required to meet its reinsurance obligations. There can be no assurance that FHCF will be able to do this. While we believe FHCF currently has adequate capital and financing capacity to meet its reinsurance obligations, there can be no assurance that it will be able to meet its obligations in the future, and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We carry a significant amount of intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Earnings for future periods may be impacted by impairment charges for intangible assets. 
 We have a significant amount of intangible assets that could be subject to impairment. If we determine that a significant impairment has occurred in the value of our unamortized intangible assets, we could be required to write off a portion of our assets, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition or our reported results of operations. 
 The inherent uncertainty of models and our reliance on such models as a tool to evaluate risk may have an adverse effect on our financial results. 
 We license analytic and modeling software from third parties to facilitate our pricing, assess our risk exposure and determine our reinsurance needs. Given the inherent uncertainty of modeling techniques and the application of such techniques, these models and databases may not accurately address the emergence of a variety of matters which might impact our exposure to losses. If these models understate the exposures we are assuming, we may not properly assess the risk and we may make poor decisions relating to pricing, underwriting, and the related amount of reinsurance we purchase. As a result, our financial results may be adversely impacted, perhaps significantly. 
 Increased competition, competitive pressures, industry developments and market conditions could affect the growth of our business and adversely impact our financial results. 
 The property and casualty insurance industry in the states in which we do business is cyclical and, during times of increased capacity, highly competitive. We compete not only with other public and private insurance companies, but also with state governmental insurance entities, mutual companies, other underwriting organizations and alternative risk sharing mechanisms. Our principal lines of business are also written by numerous other insurance companies. Competition for any one account may come from very large, well-established national companies, smaller regional companies, other specialty insurers in our field and other companies that write insurance. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources, larger agency networks and greater name recognition than we do. We compete for business not only on the basis of price, but also on the basis of financial strength, types of coverages offered, and availability of coverage desired by customers, commission structure and quality of service. We may have difficulty continuing to compete successfully on any of these bases in the future. Competitive pressures coupled with market conditions may affect our rate of premium growth and financial results. 
 15 

In addition, industry developments could further increase competition in our industry. These developments could include: 
 an influx of new capital in the marketplace as existing companies attempt to expand their businesses and new companies attempt to enter the insurance business as a result of better premium pricing and/or policy terms; 

an increase in programs in which state-sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas; 

changes in state regulatory climates; and 

the passage of federal proposals for an optional federal charter that would allow some competing insurers to operate under regulations different or less stringent than those applicable to us. 

These developments and others could make the property and casualty insurance marketplace more competitive by increasing the supply of insurance available. If competition limits our ability to write new business at adequate rates, our future results of operations would be adversely affected. 
 We may not be able to effectively integrate newly acquired businesses or achieve expected profitability from acquisitions. 
 We have in the past and may in the future expand through the acquisition of complementary businesses. This could occur through an acquisition of a company or a portion of a company s business. Any future acquisitions may entail a number of risks that could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock, including the integration of the acquired operations and information systems, diversion of management's attention, risks of entering new market regions in which we have limited experience, adverse short-term effects on our reported operating results, the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses, changes for impairment of long-terms assets or goodwill and risks associated with unanticipated liabilities 
 In connection with an acquisition, we could incur debt, recognize amortization expenses related to intangible assets, have to take large and immediate write-offs, including but not limited to goodwill impairment, and assume liabilities. We may also use our common stock to pay for acquisitions. If the owners of potential acquisition candidates are not willing to accept our common stock in exchange for their businesses, our acquisition prospects could be limited. Future acquisitions could also result in accounting charges, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and increased debt and contingent liabilities, including liabilities related to unknown or undisclosed circumstances, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and the market price of our common stock. 
 We may not be able to effectively execute our business diversification strategy. 
 We have and intend to continue to invest significant time and resources to employ our business strategies, including the rebalancing of our portfolio toward products and geographies that maximize long-term returns to our shareholders, and we may not achieve the return on our investment that we expect. Initial timetables for optimizing and diversifying our portfolio of policies may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting customer preferences may also impact the successful implementation of our business plan. Such external factors and requirements may increase our costs and potentially affect the speed with which we will be able to re-allocate capital among our portfolio of policies. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in deploying this strategy. Additionally, to the extent our business strategies include any geographic expansion, new line of business and/or new product or service, such expansion or new products or services could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 We rely on independent agents to write insurance policies for us, and if we are not able to attract and retain independent agents, our revenues would be negatively affected. 
 We write personal and commercial insurance policies through a network of independent agents. Our southeastern personal residential insurance policies are written through a network of more than 2,000 independent agents. Approximately 28 of our voluntary personal lines policies are written by agents that are affiliated with eight large agency networks with which we have entered into master agency agreements. We market and write commercial residential policies through a network of approximately 400 independent agents in Florida. Of our network of approximately 500 retail independent agents for business in the northeastern U.S., our three largest relationships represent approximately 79.0 million in annualized premiums. Of our network of approximately 70 Hawaiian independent agencies, approximately 50.6 are affiliated with three large multi-producer agencies. 
 Our strategic focus is to improve the underwriting performance of our policies throughout the states in which we are licensed, which will further increase our reliance on our network of independent agents. If any of our independent agents cease writing policies for us, or if any of our master agency agreements are terminated, we may suffer a reduction in the number of products we are able to sell, which would negatively impact our results of operations. 
 Many of our competitors also rely on independent agents. As a result, we must compete with other insurers for independent agents business. Our competitors may offer a greater variety of insurance products, lower premiums for insurance coverage, or higher 
 16 

commissions to their agents. If our products, pricing and commissions do not remain competitive, we may find it more difficult to attract business from independent agents to sell our products. 
 The failure of our claims department to effectively manage or remediate claims could adversely affect our insurance business, financial results and capital requirements. 
 We rely on our claims department and any outsourced claims resources to facilitate and oversee the claims adjustment process for our policyholders. Many factors could affect the ability of our claims department to effectively manage claims by our policyholders, including: 
 the accuracy of our adjusters as they make their assessments and submit their estimates of damages; 

the training, background and experience of our claim s representatives; 

the ability of our claims department to ensure consistent claims handling; 

the ability of our claims department to translate the information provided by adjusters into acceptable claims resolutions; and 

the ability of our claims department to maintain and update its claims handling procedures and systems as they evolve over time based on claims and geographical trends in claims reporting. 

Any failure to effectively manage the claims adjustment process, including failure to pay claims accurately, could lead to material litigation, undermine our reputation in the marketplace, impair our corporate image and negatively affect our financial results. 
 Additionally, as a component of the claims process, we leverage CAN s vendor network to provide repair and remediation services to the policyholder. If such services are not performed properly, we may face liability. Although we maintain professional liability insurance to cover losses arising from our repair and remediation services, there can be no assurances that such coverage is adequate. In addition, our failure to timely and properly remediate claims, or the perception of such failure, may damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to renew existing policies or write new policies. 
 If actual renewals of our existing contracts do not meet expectations, our premiums written in future years and our future results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
 Our insurance policies are written for a one-year term. We make assumptions about the renewal of our prior year s contracts, including for purposes of determining the amount of reinsurance we purchase. If actual renewals do not meet expectations or if we choose not to write on a renewal basis because of pricing conditions, our premiums written in future years and our future operations would be materially adversely affected, and we may purchase reinsurance beyond what we believe is the most appropriate level. 
 Our inability to maintain our financial stability rating may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, the marketability of our product offerings, and our liquidity, operating results and financial condition. 
 Financial stability ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and can have a significant effect on an insurance company s business. Many insurance buyers, agents, brokers and secured lenders use the ratings assigned by rating agencies to assist them in assessing the financial stability and overall quality of the companies from which they are considering purchasing insurance or in determining the financial stability of the company that provides insurance. Each of our insurance company affiliates currently maintain a Demotech rating of A Exceptional or higher. Our insurance company subsidiaries and the Company is also rated BBB- or better by KBRA. These financial stability ratings provide an objective baseline for assessing solvency and should not be interpreted as (and are not intended to serve as) an assessment of a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold, any securities of an insurance company or its parent holding company, including shares of our common stock. 
 On an ongoing basis, rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers and can downgrade or change the outlook on an insurer s ratings due to, for example, a change in an insurer s statutory capital, a reduced confidence in management or a host of other considerations that may or may not be under the insurer s control. All ratings are subject to continuous review; therefore, the retention of these ratings cannot be assured. A downgrade in any of these ratings could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, the marketability of our product offerings and our ability to grow in the marketplace. 
 If we are unable to expand our business because our capital must be used to pay greater than anticipated claims, our financial results may suffer. Further, we may require additional capital in the future which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms. 
 Our future growth and future capital requirements will depend on the number of insurance policies we write, the kinds of insurance products we offer, the geographic markets in which we do business and, to the extent part of our business strategy in the 
 17 

future, policy and/or geographic expansion, all balanced by the business risks we choose to assume and cede. Growth initiatives require capital. Our existing sources of funds include possible sales of common or preferred stock, incurring debt and our earnings from operations and investments. Unexpected catastrophic events in our coverage areas, such as hurricanes, may result in greater claims losses than anticipated, which could require us to limit or halt our growth while we redeploy our capital to pay these unanticipated claims unless we are able to raise additional capital. 
 To the extent that our present capital is insufficient to meet future operating requirements or to cover losses, we may need to raise additional funds through financing or curtail our growth. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our current capital together with our anticipated retained income will support our operations. However, we cannot provide any assurance in that regard, since many factors will affect the amount and timing of our capital needs, including profitability of our business, the availability and cost of reinsurance, market disruptions and other unforeseeable developments. If we require additional capital, it is possible that equity or debt financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. In the case of equity financings, dilution to our stockholders could result, and in any case such securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of existing stockholders. If we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
 Our financial results may be negatively affected by the fact that a portion of our income is generated by the investment of our company s capital, premiums and loss reserves. 
 A portion of our income is, and likely will continue to be, generated by the investment of our capital, premiums and loss reserves. The amount of income generated is a function of our investment policy, available investment opportunities and the amount of available cash invested. We are also constrained by investment limitations required by our state insurance regulators. At December 31, 2022, approximately 97 of our total investments was invested in fixed-maturity securities. We may, under certain circumstances, be required to liquidate our investments in securities at prices below book value, which may adversely affect our financial results. This risk could be amplified in periods of rising interest rates. We currently hold all of our cash in accounts with eight financial institutions and, as a result of this concentration, a portion of the balances in such accounts exceeds the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insurance limits. While we monitor and adjust the balances in our accounts as appropriate, these balances could be impacted if any of these financial institutions fail and could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets. 
 We may alter our investment policy to accept higher levels of risk with the expectation of higher returns. Fluctuating interest rates and other economic factors make it impossible to estimate accurately the amount of investment income that will be realized. In fact, we may realize losses on our investments. 
 The effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain. 
 Loss frequency and severity in the property and casualty insurance industry and multi-peril personal lines business has continued to increase in recent years, often driven by actual and social inflation. Litigation and assignment of benefits AOB in the State of Florida is an example of these trends. For example, in recent years, Florida homeowners have been assigning the benefit of their insurance recovery to third parties, which has resulted in increases in the size and number of claims and the amount of litigation, interference in the adjustment of claims, the assertion of bad faith actions and one-way rights to claim attorney fees. The Florida legislature enacted several reform bills in the last three years with the intention to limit AOB and frivolous litigation. There can be no assurance that this new legislation will reduce the future impact of AOB or litigated claims practices. 
 Many legal actions and proceedings have been brought on behalf of classes of complainants, which can increase the size of judgments. The propensity of policyholders and third-party claimants to litigate and the willingness of courts to expand causes of loss and the size of awards may render the loss reserves of our insurance subsidiaries inadequate for current and future losses. In addition, as industry practices and social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until sometime after we have issued insurance policies that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance policies may not be known at the time such policies are issued or renewed, and our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 The failure of the risk mitigation strategies we utilize could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 We utilize a number of strategies to mitigate our risk exposure including: 
 employing proper underwriting processes; 

carefully evaluating the terms and conditions of our policies; 

18 

geographic diversification; and 

ceding insurance risk to reinsurance companies. 

However, there are inherent limitations in these strategies. No assurance can be given that an event or series of unanticipated events will not result in loss levels which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 Lack of effectiveness of exclusions and other loss limitation methods in the insurance policies we assume or write could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations. 
 Various provisions of our policies, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage which are designed to limit our risks, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend. In addition, the policies we issue contain conditions requiring the prompt reporting of claims to us and our right to decline coverage in the event of a violation of that condition. While our insurance product exclusions and limitations reduce the loss exposure to us and help eliminate known exposures to certain risks, it is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void an exclusion or limitation, or legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of such endorsements and limitations in a way that would adversely affect our loss experience, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 Risks Related to Regulation of Our Insurance Operations 
 We are subject to extensive regulation which may reduce our profitability or limit our growth. Moreover, if we fail to comply with these regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including fines and suspensions, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We are subject to extensive state regulation. The NAIC and state insurance regulators regularly examine existing laws and regulations, generally focusing on modifications to holding company regulations, interpretations of existing laws and the formation of new laws. Our insurance company affiliates are subject to supervision and regulation that is primarily designed to protect our policyholders rather than our stockholders, and such regulation is imposed by the states in which we are domiciled and the states in which our insurance subsidiaries do business. These regulations relate to, among other things, the approval of policy forms and premium rates, our conduct in the marketplace, our compliance with solvency and financial reporting requirements, transactions with our affiliates, limitations on the amount of business we can write, the amount of dividends we can pay to stockholders, and the types of investments we can make. Insurance holding company regulations generally provide that transactions between an insurance company and its affiliates must be fair and reasonable and must be clearly and accurately disclosed in the records of the respective parties, with expenses and payments allocated between the parties in accordance with customary accounting practices. Many types of transactions between an insurance company and its affiliates, such as transfers of assets, loans, reinsurance agreements, service agreements, certain dividend payments by the insurance company and certain other material transactions, may be subject to prior approval by, or prior notice to, state regulatory authorities. If we are unable to obtain the requisite prior approval for a specific transaction, we would be precluded from taking the action, which could adversely affect our operations. These regulatory requirements may adversely affect or inhibit our ability to achieve some or all of our business objectives. In addition, regulatory authorities also may conduct periodic examinations into insurers business practices. These reviews may reveal deficiencies in our insurance operations or differences between our interpretations of regulatory requirements and those of the regulators. 
 State insurance regulations also frequently impose notice or approval requirements for the acquisition of specified levels of ownership in the insurance company or insurance holding company. Additionally, state legislation can impact our results of operations. For example, in 2007, Florida enacted legislation that led to rate levels in the private insurance market that we believe, in many instances in the past, were inadequate to cover the related underwriting risk. This same legislation required Citizens Property Insurance Citizens to reduce its premium rates and begin competing against private insurers in the Florida residential property insurance market. Florida lawmakers may continue to enact or retain legislation that suppresses the rates of Citizens, further adversely impacting the private insurance market and increasing the likelihood that it must levy assessments on private insurance companies and ultimately on Florida consumers. These and other aspects of the political environment in jurisdictions where we operate may reduce our profitability, limit our growth, or otherwise adversely affect our operations. 
 During the past several years, various regulatory and legislative bodies have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations to address the cyclical nature of the insurance industry, catastrophic events and insurance capacity and pricing. These regulations include (i) the creation of market assistance plans under which insurers are induced to provide certain coverages, (ii) restrictions on the ability of insurers to rescind or otherwise cancel certain policies in mid-term or to nonrenew policies at their scheduled expirations, (iii) advance notice requirements or limitations imposed for certain policy non renewals, (iv) limitations upon increases or decreases in rates permitted to be charged, (v) expansion of governmental involvement in the insurance market and (vi) increased regulation of insurers policy administration and claims handling practices. Further, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to deny or revoke licenses for various reasons, including the violation of regulations. In some instances, we follow practices based on our interpretations of regulations or practices that we believe may be generally followed by the industry. These practices may turn out to be different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply 
 19 

with applicable regulatory requirements, insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize us. This could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. 
 We cannot predict with certainty the effect any enacted, proposed or future state or federal legislation or NAIC initiatives may have on the conduct of our business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the regulatory requirements applicable to our business will not become more stringent in the future or result in materially higher costs than current requirements, or that creation of a federal insurance regulatory system will not adversely affect our business or disproportionately benefit our competitors. Changes in the regulation of our business may reduce our profitability, limit our growth or otherwise adversely affect our operations. 
 Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements, and our failure to meet these requirements could subject us to regulatory action. 
 Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed under applicable state laws. The risk-based capital standards, based upon the Risk-Based Capital Model Act adopted by the NAIC, require our insurance subsidiaries to report the results of risk-based capital calculations to state regulators and the NAIC. These risk-based capital standards provide for different levels of regulatory attention depending upon the ratio of an insurance company s total adjusted capital, as calculated in accordance with NAIC guidelines, to its authorized control level risk-based capital. Authorized control level risk-based capital is determined using the NAIC s risk-based capital formula, which measures the minimum amount of capital that an insurance company needs to support its overall business operations. 
 An insurance company with total adjusted capital that is less than 200 of its authorized control level risk-based capital is at a company action level, which would require the insurance company to file a risk-based capital plan that, among other things, contains proposals of corrective actions the company intends to take that are reasonably expected to result in the elimination of the company action level event. Additional action level events occur when the insurer s total adjusted capital falls below 150 , 100 , and 70 of its authorized control level risk-based capital. The lower the percentage, the more severe the regulatory response, including, in the event of a mandatory control level event (total adjusted capital falls below 70 of the insurer s authorized control level risk-based capital), placing the insurance company into receivership. As of December 31, 2022, our insurance subsidiaries each maintained a risk-based capital ratio of over 300 and complied with the requirement of our state regulators. Our subsidiary, HPCI, has agreed to continue to maintain a risk-based capital ratio of at least 300 . Our subsidiary, NBIC, has agreed to maintain a risk-based capital ratio requirement of 350 . 
 In addition, our insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain certain minimum capital and surplus and to limit its written premiums to specified multiples of its capital and surplus. Our insurance subsidiaries could exceed these ratios if their volume increases faster than anticipated or if their surplus declines due to catastrophe or non-catastrophe losses or excessive underwriting and operational expenses. 
 Any failure by our insurance subsidiaries to meet the applicable risk-based capital or minimum statutory capital requirements or the writings ratio limitations imposed by state law could subject our insurance subsidiaries to further examination or corrective action imposed by state regulators, including limitations on our writing of additional business, state supervision or liquidation. 
 Any changes in existing risk-based capital requirements, minimum statutory capital requirements, or applicable writings ratios may require us to increase our statutory capital levels, which we may be unable to do. 
 Litigation or regulatory actions could have a material adverse impact on us. 
 From time to time, we are subject to civil or administrative actions and litigation. Civil litigation frequently results when we do not pay insurance claims in the amounts or at the times demanded by policyholders or their representatives. We also may be subject to litigation or administrative actions arising from the conduct of our business and the regulatory authority of state insurance departments. Further, we are subject to other types of litigation inherent in operating our businesses, employing personnel, contracting with vendors and otherwise carrying out our affairs. As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may arise, including judicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new theories of liability, plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers in purported class-action litigation relating to claims-handling and other practices, and adverse changes in loss cost trends, including inflationary pressures in home repair costs. Multiparty or class action claims may present additional exposure to substantial economic, non-economic or punitive damage awards. Current and future litigation or regulatory matters may negatively affect us by resulting in the payment of substantial awards or settlements, increasing legal and compliance costs, requiring us to change certain aspects of our business operations, diverting management attention from other business issues, harming our reputation with agents and customers or making it more difficult to retain current customers and to recruit and retain employees or agents. 
 Regulation limiting rate increases and requiring us to participate in loss sharing may decrease our profitability. 
 20 

From time to time, political dispositions affect the insurance market, including efforts to effectively suppress rates at a level that may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability. Despite efforts to remove politics from insurance regulation, facts and history demonstrate that public policymakers, when faced with untoward events and adverse public sentiment, can act in ways that impede a satisfactory correlation between rates and risk. Such acts may affect our ability to obtain approval for rate changes that may be required to attain rate adequacy along with targeted levels of profitability and returns on equity. Our ability to afford reinsurance required to reduce our catastrophe risk may be dependent upon the ability to adjust rates for our cost. 
 Additionally, we are required to participate in guaranty funds for insolvent insurance companies. The funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state. Our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these factors. 
 Our revenues and operating performance will fluctuate due to statutorily approved assessments that support property and casualty insurance pools and associations. 
 We operate in a regulatory environment where certain entities and organizations have the authority to require us to participate in assessments. Currently these entities and organizations include, but are not limited to, state guaranty funds, state joint underwriting associations, fair plans, wind pools, or the FHCF. 
 Insurance companies currently pass these assessments on to holders of insurance policies in the form of a policy surcharge and reflect the collection of these assessments as fully earned credits to operations in the period collected. The collection of these fees, however, may adversely affect our overall marketing strategy due to the competitive landscape of our business. As a result, the impact of possible future assessments on our balance sheet, results of operations or cash flow are indeterminable at this time. 
 Risks Relating to Financing 
 Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly. 
 Borrowings under our credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If the rates on which our borrowings are based were to increase from current levels, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available to service our other obligations would decrease. Due to inflationary pressures on the U.S. economy and governmental action to combat inflation, interest rates increased during 2022 and it appears likely that interest rates will continue to increase during 2023, which may decrease our net income and cash flows. 
 Our credit agreement contains restrictions that can limit our flexibility in operating our business. 
 The agreement governing our credit facilities contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in certain transactions. These covenants limit our and our subsidiaries ability to, among other things: 
 incur additional indebtedness; 

declare or make any restricted payments, including dividends; 

make investments, including the contribution of capital to our insurance subsidiaries; 

create liens on any of our current or future assets; 

consolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our current or future assets; and 

enter into certain transactions with our affiliates. 

These covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors that may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions. Further, these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing and business opportunities. If we fail to comply with these covenants, it could result in an event of default under our credit facilities. If any default occurs, all amounts outstanding under our credit facilities may become immediately due and payable. 
 Dividend payments on our common stock in the future are uncertain. 
 Although we have paid dividends on our common stock in the past, the declaration and payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our profits, financial requirements and other factors, such as restrictions under 
 21 

our credit facilities, which limit our ability to pay dividends, and other legal and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends, our overall business condition and other elements our board of directors considers relevant. Therefore, investors who purchase our common stock may only realize a return on their investment if the value of our common stock appreciates. 
 We depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate and transfer funds to meet debt obligations and to make dividend payments. 
 We do not have significant revenue generating operations of our own. As such, our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations and pay dividends depends on the financial condition and operating performance of our subsidiaries. If the funds we receive from our subsidiaries, some of which are subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment of distributions, are insufficient to meet our debt obligations, we may be required to raise funds through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities, reduce or suspend dividend payments, or sell assets. 
 Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock 
 Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors and may discourage hostile takeover attempts that some of our stockholders may consider to be beneficial. 
 Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of us and our stockholders. The provisions in such certificate of incorporation and bylaws include, among other things, the following: 
 the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval; 

stockholder action can only be taken at a special or regular meeting and not by written consent; 

advance notice procedures for nominating candidates to our board of directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings; and 

allowing only our board of directors to fill vacancies on our board of directors. 

We have elected in our certificate of incorporation not to be subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, an anti-takeover law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination, such as a merger, with a person or group owning 15 or more of the corporation s voting stock for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder, unless (with certain exceptions) the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Accordingly, we will not be subject to any anti-takeover effects of Section 203. 
 While these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of our company to negotiate with our board of directors, they could enable the board of directors to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests, including an acquisition that would result in a price per share at a premium over the market price, and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. 
 These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. 
 Applicable insurance laws may make it difficult to effect a change of control of our company. 
 State insurance holding company laws require prior approval by the state insurance department of any change of control of an insurer that is domiciled in that respective state. Control is generally defined as the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a company, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. Control is generally presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of 10 or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or any entity that controls a domestic insurance company. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of us, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable. 
 Our stock price in recent years has been volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile, which may impact the value of stock held by investors. 
 22 

The market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant volatility from time to time. Such volatility may be affected by various factors and events, such as: 
 o our operating results, including a shortfall in revenues or operating performance from that expected by securities analysts and investors; 

o recognition of large unanticipated accounting charges, such as impairment charges; 

o changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance or the financial performance of our competitors or companies in our industry generally; 

o a downgrade of our Demotech or KBRA rating; 

o the announcement of a material event or anticipated event involving us or our industry or the markets in which we operate; and 

o the other risk factors described in this Annual Report. 

In recent years, the U.S. stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have sometimes affected the market price of the securities issued by a particular company in a manner unrelated to our operational performance. This type of market effect could impact the price of our common stock as well. This volatility means that the price of our common stock may have declined substantially at such time as our stockholders may look to sell shares of our common stock, which reduces the value of their investment. 
 General Risk Factors 
 Our information technology systems, or those of our key service providers, may fail or suffer a loss of security which could adversely affect our business. 
 Our insurance business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our computer and data processing systems. We rely on these systems to perform actuarial and other modeling functions necessary for writing business, as well as to handle our policy and claims administration process (i.e., handling and adjusting claims, the billing, printing and mailing of our policies, endorsements, renewal notices, etc.). The successful operation of our systems depends on a continuous supply of electricity. The failure of these systems or disruption in the supply of electricity could interrupt our operations and result in a material adverse effect on our business. 
 The development and expansion of our insurance business is dependent upon the successful development and implementation of advanced technology, including modeling, underwriting and information technology systems. We have engaged service providers to provide us with policy and other administration services for certain policies and we intend to continue to utilize third party systems. The failure of any of these systems to function as planned could adversely affect our future business volume service levels and results of operations. In addition, we have licensed certain systems and data from third parties. We cannot be certain that we will have access to these, or comparable systems, or that our technology or applications will continue to operate as intended. Moreover, we cannot be certain that we would be able to replace these systems without slowing our underwriting or claims handling response time. A major defect or failure in our internal controls or information technology systems could result in management distraction, harm to our reputation, a loss or delay of revenues or increased expense. 
 We may be subject to information technology failures, including data protection breaches and cyber-attacks, that could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, operations, and financial results. 
 We rely on our information technology systems for the effective operation of our business and for the secure maintenance and storage of confidential data relating to our business and for our policyholders. We have implemented security controls to protect our information technology systems, but experienced programmers or hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls, and develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that compromise our confidential information or that of third parties and cause a disruption or failure of our information technology systems. For example, during the first quarter of 2021, we experienced a cyber intrusion on certain of our information technology systems. In addition, we have in the past and may in the future be subject to phishing attacks in which third parties send emails purporting to be from reputable companies in order to obtain personal information and infiltrate our systems to initiate wire transfers or otherwise obtain proprietary or confidential information. 
 Our customers provide personal information that we store and maintain in our data warehouse and policy and claims systems. We have implemented systems and processes to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such personal information, but there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all security breaches or misuse of the information. Furthermore, we rely on encryption and authentication technology to provide security and authentication to effectively secure transmission of confidential information, including customer bank account, credit card information and other personal information. 
 23 

However, there is no guarantee that these systems or processes will address all of the cyber threats that continue to evolve. In addition, many of the third parties who provide products, services, or support to us could also experience any of the above cyber risks or security breaches, which could impact our policyholders and our business and could result in a loss of customers, suppliers or revenue. 
 Any compromise of our information technology systems could result in the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information, result in the unauthorized release of customer, supplier or employee data, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, expose us to a risk of litigation, cause us to incur direct losses if attackers access our actuarial and other models, bank or investment accounts. Any breach in our information systems could result in interruptions to our operations and damage to our reputation, and the misappropriation of confidential information could result in regulatory enforcement actions, substantial fines and penalties, litigation or other liability or actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Any interruption to the use or access of our information systems at critical points in time could adversely affect the timely and efficient operation of our business. Any delay in our business growth, significant costs or lost policyholders resulting from such information technology failures could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results. 
 The cost and operational consequences of implementing additional data protection measures either as a response to specific breaches or as a result of evolving changes in technology or risks, could be significant and negatively affect our business. 
 The development and implementation of new technologies will require an additional investment of our capital resources in the future. 
 Frequent technological changes, new products and services and evolving industry standards are all influencing the insurance business. We believe that the development and implementation of new technologies will require additional investment of our capital resources in the future. We have not determined, however, the amount of resources and the time that this development and implementation may require, which may result in short-term, unexpected interruptions to our business, or may result in a competitive disadvantage in price and/or efficiency, as we endeavor to develop or implement new technologies. 
 We do not have significant redundancy in our operations. 
 Despite system redundancy, our security measures and disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology may not be effective. Our systems are vulnerable to damage from a number of sources, including energy blackouts, natural disasters and other catastrophic events, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures and malicious software programs or cyber security attacks. We conduct our business primarily from offices located in Florida, Hawaii, and Rhode Island where catastrophic weather events could damage our facilities or interrupt our power supply. The loss or significant impairment of functionality in these facilities for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, as we do not have significant redundancies to replace our facilities if functionality is impaired. We contract with a third-party vendor to maintain complete daily backups of our systems; however, we have not fully tested our plan to recover data in the event of a disaster. 
 Furthermore, our disaster recovery and business continuity plans involve arrangements with our off-site, secure data centers. In the event of a catastrophic weather event or cyber security attack, we cannot assure that we will be able to access our systems from these facilities in the event that our primary systems are unavailable. While we have established infrastructure and geographic redundancy for our critical systems, our ability to utilize these redundant systems requires further testing and we cannot be assured that such systems are fully functional. 
 We are dependent on our executives, key employees and the ability to hire and retain a qualified workforce. 
 Our future success depends on the efforts of our leadership team and workforce. 
 If any other member of senior management dies or becomes incapacitated, or leaves the company to pursue employment opportunities elsewhere, we would be solely responsible for locating an adequate replacement for such senior management and for bearing any related cost. To the extent that we are unable to locate an adequate replacement or are unable to do so within a reasonable period of time, our business may be significantly and negatively affected. 
 Additionally, our future success is also based on our ability to develop the talent and skills of our human resources and attract and retain experienced and qualified employees. For example, if the quality of our underwriters, claims or other personnel decreases, we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate, which could adversely affect our results. There is strong competition within the insurance industry and from businesses outside the insurance industry for qualified employees. The unexpected loss of key employees in any of our could have a material adverse impact on our business because of the loss of such skills, knowledge of our products and years of industry experience.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Overview 
 We are a super-regional property and casualty insurance holding company that primarily provides personal and commercial residential insurance products across our multi-state footprint. We provide personal residential insurance in Alabama, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Virginia and commercial residential insurance in Florida, New Jersey, and New York. We provide personal residential insurance in Florida on both an admitted and non-admitted basis and in California on a non-admitted basis. As a vertically integrated insurer, we control or manage substantially all aspects of risk management, underwriting, claims processing and adjusting, actuarial rate making and reserving, customer service, and distribution. Our financial strength ratings are important to us in establishing our competitive position and can impact our ability to write policies. 
 Trends 
 Inflation, Underwriting and Pricing 
 We continue to address rising reinsurance and loss costs in the property insurance sector through continued implementation of increased rates and inflation guard factors resulting in an increase in the average premium per policy of 18.1 for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the prior year 2021. New rates, which are subject to approval by our regulators, become effective when a policy is written or renewed, and the premium is earned pro rata over the policy period of one year. As a result of this timing, it can take up to twenty-four months for the complete impact of a rate change to be fully earned in our financial statements. For that reason, we account for inflation in our rate indications and filings with our regulators. 
 We invest in data analytics, using software and experienced personnel, to continuously evaluate our underwriting criteria and manage exposure to catastrophe and other losses. Our retention has remained steadily in the range of 90 despite the rate increases we have implemented, in large part due to a challenging property insurance market in many of the regions in which we operate. Weather losses and a higher cost of reinsurance have impacted these markets. While we believe our rates are generally competitive with private market insurers operating in our space, we are focused on managing exposure and achieving rate adequacy throughout our book of business. 
 We continue to experience rising inflation in the form of increased labor and material costs, which drive up claim costs throughout all states in which we conduct business. Our Florida personal lines market is also seeing claim costs impacted by litigated claims, which substantially increases loss costs thereby driving up rates for the insurance buying public. Our response to this phenomenon is a combination of raising rates and reducing exposure. Claims abuse has extended throughout much of Florida, generated from assignment of benefits, excessive roof claims, and unwarranted litigated claims which far exceeds levels experienced in other states. Correspondingly, our exposure reduction plan expanded to personal lines business throughout the state of Florida. 
 Our industry experienced higher reinsurance costs and more constrained availability for catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance in the Spring 2022 renewals. We anticipate continued cost increases and availability constraints for the 2023 renewal season. As described herein, we are carefully managing exposure by reducing new business written in certain geographies, non-renewing unprofitable business in compliance with regulatory requirements, increasing rates, where permitted by regulators, and narrowing our underwriting requirements. 
 While we see improvement in the geographic distribution of our business, which is becoming more rate adequate, our Florida loss costs have continued to increase from a combination of adverse weather and exacerbation of losses on weather and other claims resulting from the litigated claims environment. 
 Recent legislative changes have been made in Florida in each of the last three years, which we believe is making some progress toward reducing losses from abusive claim reporting practices. 
 The special legislative session of December 2022 included a number of additional provisions aimed at driving down claims abuses and stabilizing the Florida property insurance market. We plan to evaluate the impact of this legislation before growing exposures in the Florida personal lines market. 
 The table below provides policy count, premiums-in-force, and TIV for Florida and all other states. Our goal is to reduce exposure in Florida given historical abusive claims practices. Florida policies-in-force and TIV have each declined from the prior year but premiums in force increased as a result of rate actions taken. For markets outside of Florida, the premiums-in-force increased while the policy count decreased due to rate actions taken.

Strategic Profitability Initiatives 
 The following provides an update to our strategic initiatives that we expect will enable us to achieve consistent long-term quarterly earnings and drive shareholder value. 
 Generate underwriting profit though rate adequacy and more selective underwriting. 

o Significant rating actions throughout the book of business resulting in an increase in average premium per policy of 18.1 over fourth quarter 2021 and 5.6 over third quarter 2022. 

o Premiums-in-force of 1.3 billion are up 9.6 from fourth quarter 2021 while policy count is down 7.2 through more selective underwriting. 

o Continued focus on timely rate actions, tightening underwriting criteria, and expanding restrictions on new business written in over-concentrated markets or products. 

Optimize capital allocation toward products and geographies that maximize long-term returns. 

o Increased commercial residential premium by 41.1 year over year while TIV only increased 21.5 and policies in force increased by only 0.4 . 

o Reduced policy count for Florida personal lines business by 16.2 as compared fourth quarter 2021. The disciplined underwriting and rating actions have reduced Florida personal lines TIV by 11.1 while reducing premiums in force by only 1.9 . 

o This disciplined underwriting approach resulted in a policy count reduction of 2.5 in other states while generating a 11.9 increase in premiums in force. 

Improve portfolio diversity. 

o No state represents over 26 of the Company s TIV. 

o The top four states grew TIV by an average 2.2 while the smallest five states grew by 56.7 . 

o As a result of diversification efforts, the top five personal lines states represented 79.2 of all TIV at fourth quarter 2022 compared to 79.8 of all TIV at fourth quarter 2021. 

Provide coverages suitable to the market and return targets. 

o Offering Excess Surplus lines E S policies in California and Florida. 

o Expanding E S to South Carolina during second quarter of 2023. 

o Continue to evaluate other states for E S and other products.

Key Components of our Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 Gross premiums written represent, with respect to a period, the sum of direct premiums written (premiums from policies written during the period, net of any midterm cancellations and renewals of voluntary policies) and assumed premiums written (primarily premiums from state fair plan policies), in each case prior to ceding premiums to reinsurers. 
 Gross premiums earned represent the total premiums earned during a period from policies written. Premiums associated with new and renewal policies are earned ratably over the twelve-month term of the policy and premiums associated with assumed policies are earned ratably over the remaining term of the policy. 
 Ceded premiums represent the cost of our reinsurance during a period. We recognize the cost of our reinsurance program ratably over term of the arrangement, which is typically twelve months. Our catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance generally incepts June 1 and runs through May 31 of the following year. Our net quota share treaty incepts December 31. Our other reinsurance programs may be purchased on a calendar or fiscal year basis. 
 Net premiums earned reflect gross premiums earned less ceded premiums during the period. 
 Net investment income represents interest earned on fixed maturity securities, short term securities and other investments, dividends on equity securities. 
 Net realized and unrealized gains or losses represent gains or losses on investment sales and unrealized gains or losses on equity securities. 
 Other revenue includes rental income due under non-cancelable leases for space at the Company s commercial property in Clearwater, Florida, and all policy and pay-plan fees. Our regulators have approved a policy fee on each policy written for certain states; to the extent these fees are not subject to refund, the Company recognizes the income immediately when collected. The Company also charges pay-plan fees to policyholders that pay premiums in more than one installment and record the fees as income when collected. 
 Expenses 
 Losses and loss adjustment expenses LAE reflect losses paid, expenses paid to resolve claims, such as fees paid to adjusters, attorneys and investigators, and changes in our reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses during the period, in each case net of losses ceded to reinsurers. Our reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated ultimate cost of resolving all reported claims plus all losses we incurred related to insured events that we assume have occurred as of the reporting date, but that policyholders have not yet reported to us (which are commonly referred to as incurred but not reported, or IBNR ). We estimate our reserves for unpaid losses using individual case-based estimates for reported claims and actuarial estimates for IBNR losses. We continually review and adjust our estimated losses as necessary based on our evolving claims experience, new information obtained and industry development trends. If our unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are considered deficient or redundant, we increase or decrease the liability in the period in which we identify the difference and reflect the change in our current period results of operations. 
 Policy acquisition costs PAC consist of: (i) commissions paid to outside agents at the time of policy issuance, (ii) policy administration fees paid to a third-party administrator at the time of policy issuance, (iii) premium taxes and (iv) inspection fees. We recognize policy acquisition costs ratably over the term of the underlying policy. We earn ceding commissions on our net quota share reinsurance contract and certain other reinsurance contracts, which are reported as a reduction to policy acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses based upon the proportion these costs bear to production of new business. Refer to Note 11 Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K. Ceding commission income is deferred and earned over the contract period. The amount and rate of ceding commissions earned on the net quota share contract can slide within a prescribed minimum and maximum, depending on loss performance and how future losses develop. 
 General and administrative expenses G A include compensation and related benefits, professional fees, office lease and related expenses, information system expenses, corporate insurance, and other general and administrative costs. As noted above, a certain portion of our ceding commissions are allocated to general and administrative expenses. 
 30 

Provision for income taxes consists of federal and state corporate level income taxes. The effective tax rate can fluctuate throughout the year as estimates used in the quarterly tax provision are updated with additional information throughout the year. The effective tax rate can vary from the 26.5 statutory federal and state blended rate depending on the amount of pretax income in proportion to permanent tax differences as well as state tax apportionment. The 2022 and 2021 effective tax rates were adversely impacted by the mostly non-deductible goodwill impairment reported of 92.0 million and 60.5 million, respectively. At December 31, 2022, the Company recognized a valuation allowance of 6.4 million against the net deferred tax asset generated at its foreign domiciled captive reinsurer, Osprey Re. The Company can only realize those net deferred tax assets to the extent Osprey Re generates future taxable income. 
 Ratios 
 Ceded premium ratio represents ceded premiums earned as a percentage of gross premiums earned. 
 Net loss ratio represents net losses and LAE as a percentage of net premiums earned. 
 Net expense ratio represents PAC and G A expenses as a percentage of net premiums earned. Ceding commission income is reported as a reduction of policy acquisition costs and G A expenses. 
 Net combined ratio represents the sum of the net loss and expense ratio. The net combined ratio is a key measure of underwriting performance traditionally used in the property and casualty insurance industry. A net combined ratio under 100 generally reflects profitable underwriting results. 
 Recent Developments 
 Economic and Market Factors 
 We continue to monitor the effects of general changes in economic and market conditions on our business. As a result of general supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, increased cost of materials and labor needed for repairs and to otherwise remediate claims. 
 Goodwill impairment Charge 
 We evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is likely that the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets may exceed the implied fair value. Any impairment is charged to operations in the period that the impairment is identified. The evaluation of goodwill impairment requires considerable management judgment and includes a review of a variety of factors as described in Note 3, Goodwill and Other Intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements. Any adverse change in those factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and a material impact on our financial results. During the second quarter of 2022, we concluded it was appropriate to perform an interim evaluation of goodwill for potential impairment given a variety of market trends. As a result of the analysis, management determined the entire amount of remaining goodwill was impaired, which reduced our carrying value of goodwill from 92.0 million to 0 based on the following factors: (i) disruptions in the equity markets, specifically for property and casualty insurance companies, largely due to recent weather-related catastrophe events; (ii) elevated loss ratios for property insurers in our markets; and (iii) trading of our stock below book value. These factors reduced our previously modeled fair value of the Company and resulted in a 92.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge, most of which is not tax deductible. 
 
 Overview of 2022 Financial Results 
 In the following section, we discuss our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. For a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, please Refer to Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the SEC on March 14, 2022. 
 The discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows provides information that will assist the reader in understanding our consolidated financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, including certain key performance indicators such as net combined ratio, ceded premium ratio, net expense ratio and net loss ratio, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our consolidated financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 154.4 million or 5.86 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of 74.7 million or 2.69 per diluted share in the prior year, with the increase stemming from a 90.8 million, net of income tax, non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter contributing a 3.45 loss per share, compared to a 60.5 

31 

million, non-cash goodwill impairment charged reported in the fourth quarter of 2021 contributing a 2.18 loss per share; combined with higher losses and loss adjustments expenses incurred for the year ended December 31, 2022, which included net losses associated with Hurricanes Ian and Nicole. In addition, the Company recorded a 6.4 million valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset related to certain tax elections made by Osprey Re, our captive reinsurer domiciled in Bermuda. The total amount of these expenses exceeded the increase in total revenue as described below. 

Gross premiums written of 1.3 billion, up 9.5 from 1.2 billion in the prior year, driven primarily by rate actions taken in all states with a policy count reduction of 7.2 driven substantially by a reduction in the number of Florida personal lines policies. Rate increases continued to meaningfully benefit written premiums throughout the book of business. 

Gross premiums earned of 1.2 billion, up 5.7 from 1.1 billion in the prior year, reflecting higher gross premiums written over the last twelve months driven by a higher average premium per policy. 

Net premiums earned of 637.1 million, up 4.3 from 611.1 million in the prior year, reflecting the higher gross earned premium outpacing the increase in ceded premiums for the year. 

Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred of 501.2 million, up 17.3 from 427.4 million in the prior year. The increase primarily stems from retained losses from Hurricanes Ian and Nicole in 2022 as well as an increase in attritional losses. Additionally, we experienced 3.7 million of adverse prior year development compared to 3.5 million of favorable prior year development in the prior year. 

Ceded premium ratio of 47.3 , up 0.7 points from 46.6 in the prior year driven by a higher cost of the 2022-2023 catastrophe excess of loss program, stemming primarily from higher costs, which was partly offset by a higher cost for severe convective storm coverage in 2021 which did not recur in 2022. The ceded premium ratio change was dampened by the increase in gross premiums earned which exceeded the increase in the cost of the reinsurance program. 

Net loss ratio of 78.7 , 8.8 points higher than the prior year of 69.9 , driven by higher losses incurred and higher ceded premium as described above. 

Net expense ratio of 35.6 , up 0.9 points from the prior year amount of 34.7 , driven by a higher ceded premium ratio as described above, as well as higher policy acquisition associated with the increase in gross premiums written. 

Net combined ratio of 114.3 , up 9.7 points from 104.6 in the prior year, driven by higher net loss and net expense ratios as described above. 

Effective tax rate was 7.1 compared to 1.7 in the prior year. The effective tax rate for 2022 was significantly lower than the statutory rate due to a non-cash, mostly tax non-deductible goodwill impairment of 92.0 million recorded in the second quarter as well as a 6.4 million valuation allowance against our Osprey Re net deferred tax assets whose utilization may be limited under the Internal Revenue Code. The effective tax rate for 2021 was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to a mostly non-deductible non-cash goodwill impairment of 60.5 million. The effective tax rate can also vary driven by the impact of permanent differences in relation to the pre-tax income or loss each year.

 Total revenue 
 Total revenue was 662.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, up 4.9 compared to 631.6 million in the prior year. The increase primarily stems from higher net premiums earned and investment income partly offset by a reduction in policy fee income, as described below. 
 Gross premiums written 
 Gross premiums written of 1.3 billion, up 9.5 year-over-year from 1.2 billion. We experienced premiums written growth of 12.1 outside Florida and 7.1 in Florida. Growth throughout our book of business was largely driven by rate increases resulting in a higher average premium per policy. Premiums-in-force were 1.3 billion as of December 31, 2022, representing a 9.6 increase from the prior year due to continued proactive underwriting and rate actions despite a reduction in policy count reduction of approximately 40,000. The reduction in policies-in-force from the fourth quarter of 2021 reflects our intentional exposure management initiatives. 
 Gross premiums earned 
 Gross premiums earned were 1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, up 5.7 compared to 1.1 billion in the prior year. The increase in gross premiums earned reflects higher gross premiums written over the last twelve months driven by rate increases, which resulted in higher average premium per policy, as described above. 
 Ceded premiums 
 Ceded premiums were 571.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, up 7.3 compared to 533.1 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily attributable to a higher cost of catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance coupled with higher ceded premiums for our quota share coverage due to the higher gross premiums written in the northeast, partly offset by a lower cost for our severe convective storm coverage from the prior year. 
 Net premiums earned 
 Net premiums earned were 637.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, up 4.3 compared to 611.1 million in the prior year. The increase primarily stems from higher gross premiums earned, partly offset by higher ceded premiums as described above. 
 33 

Net investment income 
 Net investment income, inclusive of realized investment gains (losses) and unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities, was 11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, up 109.0 compared to 5.6 million in the prior year. The increase stems from a higher interest rate environment in 2022 as compared to the prior year. 
 Other revenue 
 Other revenue was 13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, down 7.9 compared to 14.9 million in the prior year. The decrease was driven largely by lower policy fee income as a result of the reduction in policy count in Florida.

Total operating expenses 
 Total operating expenses were 819.8 million, or 17.2 from 699.6 million in the prior year. As described below, the drivers included the increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses, an increase in acquisition costs, and additional goodwill impairment. 
 Losses and loss adjustment expenses (LAE) 
 Losses and LAE were 501.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, up 17.3 compared to 427.4 million in the prior year. The increase was driven primarily by more severe catastrophe weather activity in 2022 than in 2021. The remainder was driven by higher attritional losses, as well as unfavorable loss development of 3.7 million in 2022 compared to favorable loss development of 3.5 million in 2021. 
 Policy acquisition costs 
 Policy acquisition costs were 156.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, up 7.1 compared to 146.0 million in the prior year. Higher acquisition costs were driven by the increase in gross premiums written. 
 General and administrative expenses 
 General and administrative expenses were 70.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, up 7.0 compared to 65.8 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily attributable to higher human capital costs, mostly driven by employee benefits costs, as well as the non-recurrence of a 1.5 million state tax credit recorded in 2021. 
 Goodwill impairment 
 We evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets may exceed their implied fair value. Goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level, for which we have one reporting unit level. Any impairment is charged to operations in the period that the impairment is identified. The Goodwill impairment evaluation includes a review of a variety of factors as described below, which require considerable management judgment. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 As a result of our analysis for goodwill impairment, we impaired 60.5 million of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2021 and impaired the entire amount of remaining goodwill in the second quarter of 2022, reducing our carrying value of goodwill from 92.0 million at December 31, 2021 to 0 at December 31, 2022. See the section titled Goodwill Impairment Charge above and Note 3 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more detail on our impairment of goodwill.

Net loss 
 Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 154.4 million, up 106.6 from net loss of 74.7 million in the prior year. The increase primarily relates to a goodwill impairment charge as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements coupled with higher catastrophe weather losses described above and a 6.4 million valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset as described above, partly offset by higher total revenue as described above. 
 Interest expense, net 
 Interest expense was 8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, above the prior year by 10.5 as a result of rising interest rates. 
 Benefit for income taxes 
 The benefit for income taxes was 11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to a benefit for income taxes of 1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The effective tax rate for the current year is 7.1 compared to 1.7 for the prior year. Our effective tax rate for both years was impacted by the non-deductible goodwill impairment of 92.0 million recognized during the second quarter of 2022 and 60.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2021. See further discussion of the goodwill impairment in the Note 3 of the Notes to our consolidated financial statements. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 was also impacted by a 6.4 million valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset related to certain tax elections made by Osprey Re, our captive reinsurer domiciled in Bermuda, whose utilization may be limited under the Internal Revenue Code. Finally, the effective tax rate can fluctuate throughout the year as estimates used in the quarterly tax provision are updated with additional information throughout the year, including changes to pre-tax income and from the impact of permanent differences on pre-tax income or loss.

Net combined ratio 
 The net combined ratio was 114.3 for the year ended December 31, 2022, up 9.7 points from 104.6 in the prior year. The increase stems primarily from a higher net loss and net expense ratios, described below. 
 Ceded premium ratio 
 The ceded premium ratio was 47.3 for the year ended December 31, 2022, up 0.7 points from 46.6 in the prior year. The increase primarily stems from ceded premium growth that was partly offset by growth in gross premiums earned as described above. 
 Net loss and LAE ratio 
 The net loss and LAE ratio was 78.7 for the year ended December 31, 2022, up 8.8 points from 69.9 in the prior year. The increase primarily relates to higher weather and attritional losses in the current year as a percentage of net premium earned, mostly driven by Hurricanes Ian and Nicole and 3.7 million of unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2022 compared to 3.5 million of favorable prior year reserve development in 2021, as a percentage of net premiums earned. 
 Net expense ratio 
 The net expense ratio was 35.6 for the year ended December 31, 2022, up 0.9 points from 34.7 in the prior year. The increase primarily stems from the impact of a higher ceded premium ratio as well as higher policy acquisition associated with the increase in gross premiums written. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal sources of liquidity include cash flows generated from operations, our cash, cash equivalents, our marketable securities balances and borrowings available under our credit facilities. As of December 31, 2022, we held 280.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and 653.6 million in investments, compared to 359.3 million and 694.7 million as of December 31, 2021. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily driven by payment of reinsurance premiums, claim payment, stock repurchases, 
 35 

and payment of dividends. The decrease in investments was driven by higher unrealized losses on our fixed income securities caused by rising interest rates. 
 We generally hold substantial cash balances to meet seasonal liquidity needs including amounts to pay quarterly reinsurance installments as well as meet the collateral requirements of Osprey, our captive reinsurance company, which is required to maintain a collateral trust account equal to the risk that it assumes from our insurance company affiliates. 
 We believe that our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. 
 We may continue to pursue the acquisition of complementary businesses and make strategic investments. We may increase capital expenditures consistent with our investment plans and anticipated growth strategy. Cash and cash equivalents may not be sufficient to fund such expenditures. As such, in addition to the use of our existing Credit Facilities, we may need to utilize additional debt to secure funds for such purposes.

Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 34.3 million compared to net cash provided by of 60.1 million during the prior year. The decrease in cash from operating activities relates primarily to timing of cash flows associated with claim and reinsurance payments as well as reinsurance reimbursements during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 37.9 million compared to net cash used of 124.5 million in the prior year. The change in cash used in investing activities relates primarily to allocations of funds for investment in each period. Strategic sales of investments to yield realized gains in 2020 produced proceeds which were re-invested in 2021, driving up the cash used for investing activities for that period. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 5.1 million, compared to net cash used of 17.3 million in the prior year. The decrease in cash used for financing activities was primarily driven by draws from our Revolving Credit Facility (defined below) totaling 35 million to purchase and retire 22.5 million of Convertible Notes and contribute capital to our captive reinsurer, Osprey Re. 
 Credit Facilities 
 The Company is party to a Credit Agreement by and among the Company, as borrower, certain subsidiaries of the Company from time to time party thereto as guarantors, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the Lenders ), Regions Bank, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, BMO Harris Bank N.A., as Syndication Agent, Hancock Whitney Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, as Co-Documentation Agents, and Regions Capital Markets and BMO Capital Markets Corp., as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners (as amended from time to time, the Credit Agreement ). 
 Based on the Company s results for the third quarter of 2022, management considered it likely at that time that the Company would be out of compliance with certain financial covenants in the Credit Agreement. In order to avoid a covenant violation, on November 7, 2022, the Company and its subsidiary guarantors entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) decrease the Revolving Credit Facility commitments from 75 million to 50 million, (ii) establish a new 25 million Term Loan Facility (defined below) to refinance loans outstanding under the existing Revolving Credit Facility and to pay fees, costs and expenses related thereto, (iii) reduce, from 50 million to 25 million, the aggregate amount of potential future increases to the Revolving Credit Facility commitments and/or Term Loan Facility commitments, (iii) modify the amortization of the existing term loan facility and new term loan facility to 10 per annum, paid quarterly, and (iv) increase the applicable margin for loans under the 
 36 

Credit Agreement to a range from 2.75 to 3.25 per annum for SOFR loans (plus a 0.10 credit adjustment spread) and based on a leverage ratio (an increase from the prior range of 2.50 to 3.00 ). The amendment also modified certain financial covenants in the Credit Agreement which may limit the Company s flexibility in connection with future financing transactions and in the allocation of capital in the future, including the Company s ability to pay dividends and make stock repurchases, and contribute capital to its insurance subsidiaries that are not parties to the Credit Agreement. 
 The Credit Agreement, as amended, provides for (1) a five-year senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 100 million (the Term Loan Facility and (2) a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 50 million (inclusive of a sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit equal to the unused amount of the revolving credit facility and a sublimit for swingline loans equal to the lesser of 25 million and the unused amount of the revolving credit facility) (the Revolving Credit Facility and together with the Term Loan Facility, the Credit Facilities ). 
 Term Loan Facility. The principal amount of the Term Loan Facility amortizes in quarterly installments, which began with the close of the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2019, in an amount equal to 1.9 million per quarter, payable quarterly, decreasing to 875,000 per quarter commencing with the quarter ending December 31, 2021, and increasing to 2.4 million per quarter commencing with the quarter ending December 31, 2022, with the remaining balance payable at maturity. The Term Loan Facility matures on July 28, 2026. As of November 7, 2022, after giving effect to the additional term loan advance that was used to refinance amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and to pay fees, costs and expenses related thereto, there was 73.9 million in aggregate principal outstanding under the Term Loan Facility. As of December 31, 2022, there was 89.1 million in aggregate principal outstanding under the Term Loan Facility. 
 Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility allows for borrowings of up to 50 million inclusive of a sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit equal to the unused amount of the Revolving Credit Facility and a sublimit for swingline loans equal to the lesser of 25 million and the unused amount of the Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2022, we had 25.0 million in borrowings and a 22.6 million letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with the incurrence of additional amounts under the Term Loan Facility pursuant to the amendment, the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility were repaid in full. On December 23, 2022, the Company borrowed 10.0 million under the Revolving Credit facility. At December 31, 2022, the Company had unused letters of credit totaling 32.6 million. 
 At our option, borrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest at rates equal to either (1) a rate determined by reference to SOFR, plus an applicable margin (described below) and a credit adjustment spread equal to 0.10 or (2) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the prime rate of Regions Bank, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 , and (c) the adjusted term SOFR in effect on such day for an interest period of one month plus 1.00 , plus an applicable margin (described below). 
 The applicable margin for loans under the Credit Facilities varies from 2.75 per annum to 3.25 per annum (for SOFR loans) and 1.75 to 2.25 per annum (for base rate loans) based on our consolidated leverage ratio ranging from 1.25-to-1 to greater than 2.25-to-1. Interest payments with respect to the Credit Facilities are required either on a quarterly basis (for base rate loans) or at the end of each interest period (for SOFR loans) or, if the duration of the applicable interest period exceeds three months, then every three months. As of December 31, 2022, the borrowings under the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility accruing interest at a rate of 7.32 and 7.42 per annum, respectively. 
 In addition to paying interest on outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee based on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, which is determined by our consolidated leverage ratio. 
 We may prepay the loans under the Credit Facilities, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions including minimum amounts and reimbursement of certain costs in the case of prepayments of SOFR loans. In addition, we are required to prepay the loan under the Term Loan Facility with the proceeds from certain financing transactions, involuntary dispositions or asset sales (subject, in the case of asset sales, to reinvestment rights). 
 All obligations under the Credit Facilities are or will be guaranteed by each existing and future direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiary of the Company, other than all of the Company s current and future regulated insurance subsidiaries (collectively, the Guarantors ). 
 The Company and the Guarantors are party to a Pledge and Security Agreement, (as amended from time to time the Security Agreement ), in favor of Regions Bank, as collateral agent. Pursuant to the Security Agreement, amounts borrowed under the Credit Facilities are secured on a first priority basis by a perfected security interest in substantially all of the present and future assets of the Company and each Guarantor (subject to certain exceptions), including all of the capital stock of the Company s domestic subsidiaries, other than its regulated insurance subsidiaries. 
 The Credit Agreement contains, among other things, covenants, representations and warranties and events of default customary for facilities of this type. The Company is required to maintain, as of each fiscal quarter (1) a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 2.50 to 1.00, stepping down to 2.25 to 1.00 as of the second quarter of 2024 and 2.00 to 1.00 as of the second quarter of 2025, (2) a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.20 to 1.00 and (3) a minimum consolidated net worth for the Company and its subsidiaries, which is required to be not less than 100 million plus 50 of positive quarterly net income (including its subsidiaries 
 37 

and regulated subsidiaries) plus the net cash proceeds of any equity transactions. Events of default include, among other events, (i) nonpayment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts; (ii) failure to perform or observe certain covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement; (iii) breach of any representation or warranty; (iv) cross-default to other indebtedness; (v) bankruptcy and insolvency defaults; (vi) monetary judgment defaults and material nonmonetary judgment defaults; (vii) customary ERISA defaults; (viii) a change of control of the Company; and (ix) failure to maintain specified catastrophe retentions in each of the Company s regulated insurance subsidiaries. 
 Convertible Notes 
 On August 10, 2017, the Company and Heritage MGA, LLC (the Notes Guarantor entered into a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement with Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as the initial purchaser (the Initial Purchaser ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell, and the Initial Purchaser agreed to purchase, 125.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company s 5.875 Convertible Senior Notes due 2037 (the Convertible Notes in a private placement transaction pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, as amended (the Securities Act ). The Purchase Agreement contained customary representations, warranties and agreements of the Company and the Notes Guarantor and customary conditions to closing, indemnification rights and obligations of the parties and termination provisions. The net proceeds from the offering of the Convertible Notes, after deducting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately 120.5 million. The offering of the Convertible Notes was completed on August 16, 2017. 
 The Company issued the Convertible Notes under an Indenture (the Convertible Note Indenture ), dated August 16, 2017, by and among the Company, as issuer, the Notes Guarantor, as guarantor, and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the Trustee ). 
 The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.875 per year. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears, on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company that rank senior in right of payment to the Company s future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Convertible Notes; equal in right of payment to the Company s unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior to any of the Company s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness or other liabilities incurred by the Company s subsidiaries other than the Notes Guarantor, which fully and unconditionally guarantee the Convertible Notes on a senior unsecured basis. 
 The Convertible Notes mature on August 1, 2037, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. 
 Holders may convert their Convertible Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding February 1, 2037, other than during the period from, and including, February 1, 2022 to the close of business on the second business day immediately preceding August 5, 2022, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2017, if the closing sale price of the Company s common stock, for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter immediately preceding the calendar quarter in which the conversion occurs, is more than 130 of the conversion price of the Convertible Notes in effect on each applicable trading day; (2) during the ten consecutive business-day period following any five consecutive trading-day period in which the trading price for the Convertible Notes for each such trading day was less than 98 of the closing sale price of the Company s common stock on such date multiplied by the then-current conversion rate; (3) if the Company calls any or all of the Convertible Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second business day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. 
 During the period from and including February 1, 2022 to the close of business on the second business day immediately preceding August 5, 2022, and on or after February 1, 2037 until the close of business on the second business day immediately preceding August 1, 2037, holders may surrender their Convertible Notes for conversion at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. 
 The conversion rate for the Convertible Notes was initially 67.0264 shares of common stock per 1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 14.92 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances and is subject to increase for holders that elect to convert their Convertible Notes in connection with certain corporate transactions (but not, at the Company s election, a public acquirer change of control (as defined in the Convertible Note Indenture)) that occur prior to August 5, 2022. 
 Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Convertible Note Indenture) (but not, at the Company s election, a public acquirer change of control (as defined in the Convertible Note Indenture), holders of the Convertible Notes may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Convertible Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. 
 38 

At any time prior to February 1, 2037, the Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Convertible Notes, at the Company s option, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the Convertible Notes, which means that the Company is not required to redeem or retire the Convertible Notes periodically. Holders of the Convertible Notes are able to cause the Company to repurchase their Convertible Notes for cash on any of August 1, 2022, August 1, 2027 and August 1, 2032, in each case at 100 of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the relevant repurchase date. 
 The Convertible Note Indenture contains customary terms and covenants and events of default. If an Event of Default (as defined in the Convertible Note Indenture) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the holders of at least 25 in aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes then outstanding by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare 100 of the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, all the Convertible Notes to be immediately due and payable. In the case of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization (as set forth in the Convertible Note Indenture) with respect to the Company, 100 of the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, the Convertible Notes automatically become immediately due and payable. 
 In January 2022, the Company repurchased 11.7 million principal amount of outstanding Convertible Notes. As of December 31, 2022, there was 885,000 principal amount of outstanding Convertible Notes, net of 21.1 million of Convertible Notes held by an insurance company subsidiary. 
 As discussed above, holders of the Convertible Notes issued by the Company had an optional put right, pursuant to the indenture governing the Convertible Notes, to require the Company to repurchase the aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes that are validly tendered. The Company received notice from the Depositary for the Convertible Notes that, on July 29, 2022, 10.9 million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes has been validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the indenture and the Company s notice with respect to the optional put right of the Convertible Notes, and the Company has requested that the Trustee cancel the Convertible Notes tendered. The outstanding balance as of December 31, 2022 of non-affiliated Notes was 885,000. On August 1, 2022, the Company made payments for the principal amount of the Convertible Notes tendered and unpaid interest in the aggregate amounts of 10.9 million and 320,041, respectively. The Company has drawn 10.0 million from the Revolving Credit Facility to replenish the cash used to pay the 10.9 million for the purchase of the tendered Convertible Notes. 
 FHLB Loan Agreements 
 In December 2018, a subsidiary of the Company pledged U.S. government and agency fixed maturity securities with an estimated fair value of 24.3 million as collateral and received 19.2 million in a cash loan under an advance agreement with the FHLB Atlanta. The loan originated on December 12, 2018 and bears a fixed interest rate of 3.094 with interest payments due quarterly commencing in March 2019. The principal balance on the loan has a maturity date of December 13, 2023. In connection with the agreement, the subsidiary became a member of FHLB. Membership in the FHLB required an investment in FHLB s common stock which was purchased on December 31, 2018 and valued at 1.4 million. As of December 31, 2022, the common stock was valued at 1.5 million. The subsidiary is permitted to withdraw any portion of the pledged collateral over the minimum collateral requirement at any time, other than in the event of a default by the subsidiary. The proceeds from the loan were used to prepay the Company s Senior Secured Notes due 2023 in 2018.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The following discussion and analysis presents the more significant factors that affected our financial conditions as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and results of operations for each of the years then ended. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles of generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. While we base estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 We consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if (i) the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and (ii) different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimates in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. When we prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we must make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts we report. Certain of these estimates result from judgments that can be subjective and complex. As a result of that subjectivity and complexity, and because we continuously evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on a variety of factors, actual results could materially differ from our estimates and assumptions if changes in one or more factors require us to make accounting adjustments. 
 Premiums . We recognize direct and assumed premiums written as revenue, net of ceded amounts, on a daily pro rata basis over the contract period of the related policies that are in force. For any portion of premiums not earned at the end of the reporting period, we record an unearned premium liability. 
 Premiums receivable represents amounts due from our policyholders for billed premiums and related policy fees. Our billing system is equity based such that policies are canceled if the unpaid premium exceeds the amount of premium earned. When we receive payments on amounts previously charged off, we credit bad debt expense in the period we receive the payment. Balances in premiums receivable and the associated allowance account are removed upon cancellation of the policy due to non-payment. We recorded bad debt expense of approximately 0, 0 and 161,300 in 2022, 2021, 2020, respectively. 
 When we receive premium payments from policyholders prior to the effective date of the related policy, we record an advance premium liability. On the policy effective date, we reduce the advance premium liability and record the premiums as described above. 
 Reserves for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses . Reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, also referred to as loss reserves, represent the most significant accounting estimate inherent in the preparation of our financial statements. These reserves represent management s best estimate of the amount we will ultimately pay for losses and loss adjustment expenses and we base the amount upon the application of various actuarial reserve estimation techniques as well as considering other material facts and circumstances known at the balance sheet date. We establish two categories of loss reserves as follows: Case reserves When a claim is reported, we establish an initial estimate of the losses that will ultimately be paid on the reported claim. Our initial estimate for each claim is based upon the judgment of our claims professionals who are familiar with property and liability losses associated with the coverage offered by our policies. Then, our claims personnel perform an evaluation of the type of claim involved, the circumstances surrounding each claim and the policy provisions relating to the loss and adjust the reserve, as necessary. As claims mature, we increase or decrease the reserve estimates as deemed necessary by our claims department based upon additional information we receive regarding the loss, the results of on-site reviews and any other information we gather while reviewing the claims. IBNR reserves Our IBNR reserves include true IBNR reserves plus bulk reserves. True IBNR reserves represent amounts related to claims for which a loss occurred on or before the date of the financial statements, but which have not yet been reported to us. Bulk reserves represent additional amounts that cannot be allocated to particular claims, but which are necessary to estimate ultimate losses on known claims. We estimate our IBNR reserves by projecting our ultimate losses using industry accepted actuarial methods and then deducting actual loss payments and case reserves from the projected ultimate losses. We review and adjust our IBNR reserves on a quarterly basis based on information available to us at the balance sheet date. 
 40 

When we establish our reserves, we analyze various factors such as the evolving historical loss experience of the insurance industry as well as our experience, claims frequency and severity, our business mix, our claims processing procedures, legislative enactments, judicial decisions and legal developments in imposition of damages, and general economic conditions, including inflation. A change in any of these factors from the assumptions implicit in our estimates will cause our ultimate loss experience to be better or worse than indicated by our reserves, and the difference could be material. Due to the interaction of the foregoing factors, there is no precise method for evaluating the impact of any one specific factor in isolation, and an element of judgment is ultimately required. Due to the uncertain nature of any future projections, the ultimate amount we will pay for losses will be different from the reserves we record. 
 We determine our ultimate loss reserves by selecting an estimate within a relevant range of indications that we calculate using generally accepted actuarial techniques. Our selection of the point estimate is influenced by the analysis of our paid losses and incurred losses since inception. 
 Our external reserving actuaries evaluated the adequacy of our reserves as of December 31, 2022 and concluded that our reported loss reserves would meet the requirements of the insurance laws of the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, be consistent with reserves computed in accordance with accepted loss reserving standards and principles, and make a reasonable provision for all unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense obligations under the terms of our contracts and agreements. In addition to 300.6 million of recorded case reserves, we recorded 831.2 million of IBNR reserves as of December 31, 2022 to achieve overall gross reserves of 1.1 billion. At December 31, 2022, ceded IBNR and net IBNR were 546.0 million and 285.2 million, respectively. 
 The process of establishing our reserves is complex and inherently imprecise, as it involves using judgment that is affected by many variables. We believe a reasonably likely change in almost any of the factors we evaluate as part of our loss reserve analysis could have an impact on our reported results, financial position and liquidity.

Policy Acquisition Costs. We incur policy acquisition costs that vary with, and are directly related to, the production of new business. Policy acquisition costs consist of the following four items: (i) commissions paid to outside agents at the time of policy issuance, (ii) policy administration fees paid to a third-party administrator at the time of policy issuance, (iii) premium taxes and (iv) inspection fees. We capitalize policy acquisition costs to the extent recoverable, then we amortize those costs over the contract period of the related policy. We also earn ceding commission on our quota share reinsurance contracts, which is presented as a reduction of policy acquisition costs with any unearned ceding commission recognized as a liability. Ceding commission income is deferred and earned over the contract period. The amount and rate of ceding commissions earned on the net quota share contract can slide within a prescribed minimum and maximum, depending on loss performance and how future losses develop. 
 Our accounting policy is to allocate ceding commission between policy acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses for financial reporting purposes based upon the proportion these costs bear to production of new business. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we earned ceding commission income of 61.8 million, 62.7 million and 57.1 million of which 46.5 million, 47.1 million and 43.0 million was allocable to policy acquisition costs. 
 Deferred taxes . At December 31, 2022, we assessed our deferred tax position and hold a 6.4 million valuation against our net deferred tax assets. We intend to continue maintaining the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of the allowance. 
 41 

Provision for Premium Deficiency . At each reporting date, we determine whether we have a premium deficiency. A premium deficiency would result if the sum of our expected losses, deferred policy acquisition costs and policy maintenance costs (such as costs to store records and costs incurred to collect premiums and pay commissions) exceeded our related unearned premiums plus investment income. Should we determine that a premium deficiency exists, we would write off the unrecoverable portion of deferred policy acquisition costs. No accruals for premium deficiency were considered necessary as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 Reinsurance. We follow industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our risks. Reinsurance involves transferring, or ceding , all or a portion of the risk exposure on policies we write to another insurer, known as a reinsurer. To the extent that our reinsurers are unable to meet the obligations they assume under our reinsurance agreements, we remain liable for the entire insured loss. 
 Our reinsurance agreements are prospective contracts. We record an asset, prepaid reinsurance premiums, and a liability, reinsurance payable, for the entire contract amount upon commencement of our new reinsurance agreements. We amortize our prepaid reinsurance premiums over the 12-month contract period. 
 In the event that we incur losses recoverable under our reinsurance program, we record amounts recoverable from our reinsurers on paid losses plus an estimate of amounts recoverable on unpaid losses. The estimate of amounts recoverable on unpaid losses is a function of our liability for unpaid losses associated with the reinsured policies; therefore, the amount changes in conjunction with any changes to our estimate of unpaid losses. In the event that we incur losses recoverable under the reinsurance program, the estimate of amounts recoverable from reinsurers on unpaid losses may change at any point in the future because of its relation to our reserves for unpaid losses. 
 We estimate uncollectible amounts receivable from reinsurers based on an assessment of factors including the creditworthiness of the reinsurers and the adequacy of collateral obtained, where applicable. We had no uncollectible amounts under our reinsurance program or bad debt expense related to reinsurance for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective 
 The Company describes the recent pronouncements that have had or may have a significant effect on its financial statements or on its disclosures. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that a) are not anticipated to have an impact on, or b) are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, or related disclosures. For accounting pronouncements not yet adopted, Refer to Note 1 Basis of Presentation, Nature of Business and Significant Accounting Policies and Practices to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further information. 
 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Our investment portfolios at December 31, 2022, include interest rate-sensitive securities, mainly fixed income securities. Our fixed income securities portfolio is comprised primarily of investment grade (investments receiving Standard Poor's Global Ratings S P or an equivalent rating of BBB- or above) corporate securities, U.S. government and agency securities, municipal obligations, collateralized loan obligations CLO and other asset-backed securities ABS ), and mortgage-backed securities MBS ). Our main objective is to maximize after-tax investment income and maintain sufficient liquidity to meet policyholder obligations while minimizing market risk, which is the potential economic loss from adverse fluctuations in securities prices. We consider many factors when establishing our investment policy, including credit ratings, investment concentrations, regulatory requirements, anticipated fluctuation of interest rates, durations and market conditions in developing investment strategies. Investment securities are managed by a nationally recognized asset manager and are overseen by the investment committee appointed by our board of directors. We classify our fixed-maturity securities as available-for-sale and report any unrealized gains or losses, net of deferred income taxes, as a component of other comprehensive income within our stockholders equity. As such, any material temporary changes in their fair value can adversely impact the carrying value of our stockholders equity. Unrealized gains and losses for any equity securities held are reported in our consolidated statement of operations as a component of net realized and unrealized gains and losses. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 On November 7, 2022, the Company amended its Credit Agreement to replace LIBOR with an alternative benchmark rate. Borrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest at rates equal to either (1) a rate determined by reference to SOFR, plus an applicable margin and a credit adjustment spread equal to 0.10 or (2) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the prime rate of Regions Bank, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 , and (c) the adjusted term SOFR in effect on such day for an interest period of one month plus 1.00 , plus an applicable margin, eliminating any reference to LIBOR. 
 Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates. Our fixed income securities portfolio contains interest rate-sensitive instruments, and its performance could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates resulting from governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond our control. All else being equal, a rise in interest rates will decrease the fair value of our existing fixed income investments, and a decline in interest rates will increase the fair value of our existing fixed income investments. 
 42 

However, new and reinvested money used to purchase fixed income securities would benefit from rising interest rates and would be negatively impacted by falling interest rates. We seek to mitigate our interest rate risk associated with holding fixed income investments by monitoring and managing the effective duration of our portfolio to maximize yield while managing interest rate risk at an acceptable level. 
 The duration of the financial instruments held in our portfolio that are subject to interest rate risk was 3.179 years at December 31, 2022 and 3.903 years at December 31, 2021. Credit risk results from uncertainty in a counterparty s ability to meet its obligations. Credit risk is managed by maintaining a high credit quality fixed maturity securities portfolio. As of December 31, 2022, the estimated weighted-average credit quality rating of the fixed maturity securities portfolio was A+, at fair value, consistent with our average credit quality rating at December 31, 2021.

Credit risk can expose us to potential losses arising principally from adverse changes in the financial condition of the issuer of our fixed-maturity securities. The Company s Investment Committee has the responsibility to create, oversee, implement and review investment policies. The Investment Committee is responsible for ensuring the policies mitigate this risk by investing in fixed-maturity securities that are generally investment grade and by diversifying our investment portfolio to avoid concentrations in any single issuer or market sector.

Below investment grade securities have different characteristics than investment grade corporate fixed-maturity securities. Risk of loss from default by the borrower is greater with below-investment grade securities. Typically, below investment grade securities are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer. Also, issuers of below-grade securities usually have higher levels of debt and are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions, such as recession or increasing interest rates, than investment grade issuers. 
 Our equity investment portfolio at December 31, 2022 consisted of membership shares held of FHLB common stock which are carried at cost. The estimated fair value of the FHLB common stock was based on the amount we would receive if our memberships were canceled, as the membership cannot be sold.

 The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements; maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting; and its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Liability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses - Refer to Notes 1 and 13 to the Financial Statements 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 The Company s estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense (LAE) totaled 1.1 billion at December 31, 2022. The Company s reserve for unpaid losses and LAE represents the estimated ultimate cost of settling all claims incurred related to insured events that have occurred as of the reporting date. The Company determines the reserve for unpaid losses and LAE on an individual-case basis for those claims reported as of December 31, 2022, with bulk reserves for additional development, if any, on the reported claims and an estimate for unpaid losses and LAE for all claims incurred related to insured events that have occurred as of December 31, 2022 but have not yet been reported by the policyholders to the Company (collectively referred to as incurred but not reported or IBNR). The Company estimates IBNR reserves by projecting ultimate losses using industry-accepted actuarial methods. Management engages independent actuarial firms to prepare an actuarial analysis of unpaid losses and LAE and provides statements of actuarial opinion on management s estimate of unpaid losses and LAE. 
 
 Estimating the liability for unpaid losses and LAE requires significant judgment, relating to factors such as claim development patterns, severity, type and jurisdiction of loss, economic conditions, legislative development, and a variety of actuarial assumptions. Estimating the liability for unpaid losses and LAE is inherently uncertain, dependent on management s judgment, and significantly impacted by claim and actuarial factors and conditions that may change over time. The ultimate settlement of unpaid losses and LAE may vary materially from the recorded liability, and such variance may adversely affect the Company s financial results. For these reasons, we identified the estimate of unpaid losses and LAE as a critical audit matter, as it involved especially subjective auditor judgment. 
 How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit 
 Our audit procedures related to the unpaid losses and LAE reserve included the following, among others: 
 We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of key controls over the process and data used by management to estimate the liability for unpaid losses and LAE, including those controls related to the estimation of and management s review of the estimated liability of unpaid losses and LAE. 

We tested the completeness, integrity, and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company s actuaries, such as paid loss data, case reserve data, loss adjustment expense data, and loss development tables. 

We verified the consistency of the estimation process between the current year and those used in prior years and assessed the reasonableness of management s selection of its estimate for unpaid losses and LAE, including the key factors considered by management in arriving at such estimates. With assistance from our engaged actuarial specialist, we reviewed the reasonableness of the methods and assumptions used by the Company and their engaged actuaries to develop their unpaid losses and LAE reserve estimate. 

We evaluated management s prior year estimate for unpaid losses and LAE and the factors leading to changes in the estimate recognized in the current year. With the assistance of our engaged actuarial specialist, we assessed the reasonableness of management s revisions to the estimate for unpaid losses and LAE. 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2018.

The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for interest bearing deposits approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments. To the extent there are negative cash balances with any individual financial institution, the Company excludes the negative amount from cash and cash equivalents neg ative cash balances and reports as accounts payable and other liabilities. 
 and million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company earned interest income of and on its restricted cash deposits. 
 Short-term Securities Short-terms securities have an original maturity of less than and are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Accumulated other comprehensive income consists solely of unrealized gains and losses on debt securities available-for-sale, net of tax. Investment Gains and Losses Net realized investment gains and losses are included as a component of pre-tax revenues based upon specific identification of the investments sold on the trade date. Included in net realized and unrealized gains (losses) are credit impairment losses on invested assets other than those investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting described in the Allowance for Credit Losses and Impairment of Other Investments section discussed below. Allowance for Credit Losses (Available-for-Sale-Debt Securities) The impairment model for available-for-sale AFS debt securities differs from the current expected credit loss CECL methodology applied for held to maturity debt securities because AFS debt securities are measured at fair value rather than amortized cost. Although ASC 326 replaced the legacy other-than-temporary impairment OTTI model with a credit loss model, it retained the fundamental nature of the legacy OTTI model. For AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either criteria is met, the security s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For AFS debt securities where neither of the criteria are met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the credit rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited to the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Under the guidance, an entity may no longer consider the length of time fair value has been less than amortized cost. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, management evaluated and determined a credit allowance was not significant to the financial statements. Other Investments Non-Consolidating Variable Interest Entities VIEs The Company makes passive investments in limited partnerships LPs ), corporations, and a Real Estate Investment Trust REIT ). The Company determines at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which it has made an investment or in which it has other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity VIE ). The Company consolidates VIEs when it is determined to be the primary beneficiary. The Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE when it has the power to direct activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or entitled to benefits. If the Company is not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, it will account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company was not the primary beneficiary to any of its other investments and therefore considered the other investments as non-consolidated VIEs. Equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method, are measured at fair value. Equity securities without a readily determinable fair value are reported at cost, less impairment, unless we identify observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer (measurement alternative). Changes in fair value are reflected in the Company s consolidated statements of operations. Certain other investments provide the Company with monthly or quarterly return on capital on a regular schedule. Impairment of Other Investments The Company maintains various interests in other investments without a readily determinable fair value that are evaluated for impairment at each reporting period. When such events or changes occur, the Company evaluates the estimated present value of future cash flows compared to its cost basis in the investment to evaluate whether there may be an impairment. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded impairment charges on its other investments compared to recording an impairment of million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

 ; computer hardware and software ; office and furniture equipment to . Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the asset s useful life. Expenditures for improvements are capitalized to the property accounts. Replacements and maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the life of the respective assets are expensed as incurred. 
 
 . We determine whether an arrangement constitutes a lease and record lease liabilities and right-of-use assets on our consolidated balance sheets at lease commencement. We primarily use our incremental borrowing rates for our operating leases (rates are not readily determinable) and implicit rates for our financing leases in determining the present value of lease payments. We measure right-of-use assets based on the corresponding lease liability adjusted for (i) payments made to the lessor at or before the commencement date, (ii) initial direct costs we incur and (iii) tenant incentives under the lease. We begin recognizing rent expense when the lessor makes the underlying asset available to us, we do not assume renewals or early terminations unless we are reasonably certain to exercise these options at commencement, and we do not allocate consideration between lease and non-lease components. For short-term leases, we record rent expense in our consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term and record variable lease payments as incurred.

The Company s unrealized losses on corporate bonds have not been recognized because the bonds are of a high credit quality with investment grade ratings. The Company does not intend to sell and it is unlikely the Company will be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is deemed due to changes in interest rates and other market conditions. The debt issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments on the bonds. After taking into account these and other factors previously described, the Company believes these unrealized losses generally were caused by a decrease in market interest rates since the time the securities were purchased and not as a result of credit losses. Other Investments Non-Consolidated Variable Interest Entities VIEs The Company makes passive investments in limited partnerships LPs ), which is accounted for using the equity method, with income reported in net realized and unrealized gains and losses. The Company also makes passive investments in a Real Estate Investment Trust REIT and Insuretech company, which are accounted for using the measurement alternative method, which is reported at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus changes from observable price changes, as described in the table below.

The Company utilizes a combination of approaches to value the Company s single reporting unit. The estimate of fair value was derived from the weighting of the income approach (discounted cash flow model) in conjunction with the market approach (guideline public company method and guideline transaction method) to determine the fair value of the single reporting unit. Management tests goodwill a nd other intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently should events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill or the Company s other intangible assets might be impaired. During the second quarter of 2022, management determined a triggering event occurred for which it deemed an interim evaluation of goodwill was appropriate and concluded the remaining balance of its goodwill was fully impaired. The carrying value of million was written off based on the following factors: (i) disruptions in the equity markets, specifically for property and casualty insurance companies, largely due to recent weather-related catastrophe events; (ii) elevated loss ratios for property insurers in the Company s markets; and (iii) the Company s market cap was below book value. These factors reduced the Company s previously modeled fair value of the Company and resulted in a million goodwill impairment charge, as of the second quarter of 2022, most of which was not tax deductible. Other Intangible Assets Our intangible assets resulted primarily from the acquisitions of Zephyr Acquisition Company and NBIC Holdings, Inc. and consist of brand, agent relationships, renewal rights, customer relations, trade names, non-competes and insurance licenses.

Non-recurring fair value measurements Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include intangible assets and goodwill which are recognized at fair value during the period in which an acquisition is completed, from updated estimates and assumptions during the measurement period, or when they are considered to be impaired. To evaluate such assets for a potential impairment, we determine the fair value of the goodwill and intangible assets using a combination of a discounted cash flow approach and market approaches, which contain significant unobservable inputs and therefore are considered a Level 3 fair value measurement. The unobservable inputs in the analysis generally include future cash flow projections and a discount rate. Certain of our investments in accordance with GAAP for the type of investment, are measured using methodologies other than fair value.

Purchasing a sufficient amount of reinsurance to cover catastrophic losses from single or multiple events or significant non-catastrophe losses is an important part of the Company s risk strategy. Reinsurance involves transferring, or ceding , a portion of the risk exposure on policies we write to another insurer, known as a reinsurer. To the extent that the Company s reinsurers are unable to meet the obligations they assume under the Company s reinsurance agreements, the Company remains liable for the entire insured loss. The Company s insurance regulators require all insurance companies, like us, to have a certain amount of capital and reinsurance coverage in order to cover losses and loss adjustment expenses upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event. The Company s reinsurance program provides reinsurance in excess of its state regulator requirements, which are based on the probable maximum loss that it would incur from an individual catastrophic event estimated to occur once in every 100 years based on its portfolio of insured risks. The nature, severity and location of the event giving rise to such a probable maximum loss differs for each insurer depending on the insurer s portfolio of insured risks, including, among other things, the geographic concentration of insured value within such portfolio. As a result, a particular catastrophic event could be a one-in-100-year loss event for one insurance company while having a greater or lesser probability of occurrence for another insurance company. The Company also purchases reinsurance coverage to protect against the potential for multiple catastrophic events occurring in the same year. The Company shares portions of its reinsurance program coverage among its insurance company affiliates.

The catastrophe reinsurance programs are allocated among traditional reinsurers, the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund FHCF ), Citrus Re and Osprey Re Ltd Osprey ), the Company s captive reinsurer. The FHCF covers Florida risks only and the Company elected to participate at for the 2022 hurricane season. Osprey Re will provide reinsurance for a portion of the Heritage P C, NBIC and Zephyr programs. The Company s third-party reinsurers are either rated A- or higher by A.M. Best or S P or are fully collateralized, to reduce credit risk. Osprey Re is fully collateralized.

The 2022-2023 reinsurance program provides first event coverage up to billion for Heritage P C, first event coverage up to billion for NBIC, and first event coverage up to million for Zephyr. The Company s first event retention in a 1 in 100-year event would include retention for the respective insurance company as well as any retention by Osprey. The first event maximum retention up to a 1 in 100-year event for each insurance company subsidiary is as follows: Heritage P C million, of which million would be ceded to Osprey; NBIC million of which million would be ceded to Osprey in a shared contract with Zephyr; and Zephyr million, of which million would be ceded to Osprey in a shared contract with NBIC. The Company is responsible for all losses and loss adjustment expenses in excess of our reinsurance program. For second or subsequent catastrophic events, the Company s total available coverage depends on the magnitude of the first event, as the Company may have coverage remaining from layers that were not previously fully exhausted. An aggregate of billion of limit purchased in 2022 includes reinstatement through the purchase of reinstatement premium protection.

An occurrence limit of million for catastrophe losses is in effect on the quota share program, subject to certain aggregate loss limits that vary by reinsurer. The amount and rate of ceding commissions slide, within a prescribed minimum and maximum, depending on loss performance. The Net Quota Share program was renewed on December 31, 2022 ceding of the net premiums and losses and of the prior year quota share is in run off. Per Risk Coverage For losses arising from business underwritten by Heritage P C and losses arising from commercial residential business underwritten by NBIC, excluding losses from named storms, the Company purchased property per risk coverage for losses and loss adjustment expenses in excess of million per claim. The limit recovered for an individual loss is million and total limit for all losses is million.

Specifically, starting in the first quarter of 2023, the Seventh Amendment amended certain financial covenants as follows: (1) x in the second quarter of 2023 not to exceed x as of the second quarter of 2024 and x as of the second quarter of 2025 , (2) apply all (A) Restricted Payments (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and (B) fee forgiveness other capital contributions to the Company s regulated insurance companies that are not a party to the Credit Agreement that exceed million, when calculating (i) million plus 50 of positive quarterly net income (including its subsidiaries and regulated subsidiaries) plus the net cash proceeds of any equity transactions and (ii) Consolidated Fixed Charge Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) which is required to be x .

As of the date of this report, we were in compliance with the applicable terms of all our covenants and other requirements under the Credit Agreement, Convertible Notes, cash borrowings and other loans. Our ability to secure future debt financing depend, in part, on our ability to remain in such compliance. The covenants in the Credit Agreement may limit the Company s flexibility in connection with future financing transactions and in the allocation of capital in the future, including the Company s ability to pay dividends and make stock repurchases, and contribute capital to its insurance subsidiaries that are not parties to the Credit Agreement. The covenants and other requirements under the revolving agreement represent the most restrictive provisions that we are subject to with respect to our long-term debt.

The effective tax rates for 2022 and 2021 were impacted by non-deductible goodwill impairment of million recognized during the second quarter of 2022 and million during fourth quarter of 2021. Furthermore, the 2022 effective tax rate was impacted by the recognition of a million valuation allowance related to a portion of its deferred tax inventory associated with its foreign domiciled captive reinsurer, Osprey Re. The Company may only realize those net deferred tax assets to the extent Osprey Re generates future taxable income. Additionally, the effective tax rates were affected by various permanent tax differences, including disallowed executive compensation deductions which were further limited in 2017 and future years upon the enactment of H.R.1, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Tax Act ). The effective tax rate for 2020 benefitted from a tax rate change related to a carryback of a tax net operating loss, which was carried back under The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. On March 27, 2020, former President Trump signed into law the CARES Act to mitigate the economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. The CARES Act amended the law for net operating losses generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021. Net operating losses generated by a corporation during these taxable years are allowed a carryback period. As the Company had a 2020 tax net operating loss, the Company s 2020 rate reconciliation reflects the favorable million tax benefit from carrying back tax losses to years for which the statutory rate was 35 . Enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 

 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Tax Act) was enacted on August 16, 2022. Along with other changes, the Tax Act created a new corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) for certain corporations based on of adjusted financial statement income for the taxable year. The Company does not meet the requirements to be subject to the AMT for 2023. In addition, the Tax Act imposes a excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. The effective date of these two provisions was January 1, 2023.

The Company had capital loss carryforward as of December 31, 2022. In assessing the net carrying amount of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. During 2022, the Company recorded a million valuation allowance related to a portion of its deferred tax inventory related to a portion of its deferred tax inventory associated with its foreign domiciled captive reinsurer, Osprey Re. The Company may only realize those net deferred tax assets to the extent Osprey Re generates future taxable income. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has a gross operating loss carryforward for federal and state income tax purposes of and million, respectively, which will expire between 2040 and 2042. The statute of limitations related to our federal and state income tax returns remains open from our filings for 2019 through 2021. There are currently no tax years under examination. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had uncertain tax positions or unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective income tax rate. Our reinsurance affiliate, Osprey Re, Ltd., which is based in Bermuda, made an irrevocable election under section 953(d) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to be treated as a domestic insurance company for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. As a result of this election, our reinsurance subsidiary is subject to United States income tax as if it were a U.S. corporation. As of December 31, 2022, the Comp any had uncertain tax positions or unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective income tax rate. 

 million a nd million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company s insurance subsidiaries must maintain capital and surplus ratios or balances as determined by the regulatory authority of the states in which they are domiciled. Heritage P C is required to maintain statutory-basis capital and surplus equal to the million or of their respective liabilities. Zephyr is required to maintain a deposit of in a federally insured financial institution. NBIC is required to maintain statutory-basis capital and surplus of million. The combined statutory surplus for Heritage P C, NBIC, and Zephyr w as million at December 31, 2022. The combined statutory-basis surplus for Heritage P C, NBIC, and Zephyr was million at December 31, 2021. State laws also require the Company s insurance subsidiaries to adhere to prescribed premium-to-capital surplus ratios, with which the Company s insurance affiliates are complying. At December 31, 2022, our insurance subsidiaries met the financial and regulatory requirements of the states in which they do business. The legislatures of the states of domicile of our insurance affiliates have adopted the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC recommendations with regard to expansion of the regulation of insurers to include non-insurance entity affiliates. Specifically, the law permits the state insurance regulators to examine affiliated entities within an insurance holding company system in order to ascertain the financial condition of the insurer. The law also provides for certain disclosures regarding enterprise risk, which are satisfied by the provision of related information filed with the SEC. The NAIC published risk-based capital guidelines for insurance companies that are designed to assess capital adequacy and to raise the level of protection that statutory-basis surplus provides for policy holders. Most states, including Florida, Hawaii, and Rhode Island, have enacted the NAIC guidelines as statutory requirements, and insurers having less statutory-basis surplus than required will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy. State insurance regulatory authorities could require an insurer to cease operations in the event the insurer fails to maintain the required statutory capital. State laws for Florida, Hawaii, and Rhode Island permit an insurer to pay dividends or make distributions out of that part of statutory surplus derived from net operating profit and net realized capital gains. The applicable laws pertain to the state of domicile of each insurance company affiliate and provide calculations to determine the amount of dividends or distributions that can be made without the prior approval of the insurance regulatory authority and the amount of dividends or distributions that would require prior approval of the insurance regulatory authority. In the state of Florida, a dividend may be taken without regulatory approval if the dividend is equal to or less than the greater of of the insurer s surplus or the insurer s net income. In the state of Rhode Island, a dividend may be taken without regulatory approval if the dividend is equal to or less than the lesser of of the insurer s surplus or the insurer s net income excluding realized capital gains. The state of Hawaii restricts dividends without regulatory approval to the smaller of prior years net income or of prior year s surplus. Heritage P C and NBIC have t paid dividends in any of the last three years. Zephyr paid dividends of mil lion and million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Statutory risk-based capital requirements may further restrict our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends or make distributions if the amount of the intended dividend or distribution would cause statutory-basis surplus to fall below minimum risk-based capital requirements. State insurance laws limits an insurer s investment in equity instruments and also restricts investments in medium to low quality debt instruments. The Company s insurance affiliates were in compliance with all investment restrictions at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Governmental agencies or certain quasi-governmental entities can levy assessments upon the Company in the states in which the Company writes policies. Refer to Note 1 Basis of Presentation, Nature of Business and Significant Accounting Policies and Practices to these consolidated financial statements for further information for a description of how the Company recovers assessments imposed upon it. Governmental agencies or certain quasi-governmental entities can also levy assessments upon policyholders, and the Company collects the amount of the assessments from policyholders as surcharges for the benefit of the assessing agency. There are currently assessments being collected from policyholders and remitted to governmental or quasi-governmental entities. If an assessment becomes levied the Company would multiply the premium written on each policy by these assessment percentages to determine the additional amount that it will collect from the policyholder and remit to the assessing agencies. The Company reported its insurance subsidiaries assets, liabilities and results of operations in accordance with GAAP, which varies from statutory-basis accounting principles prescribed or permitted by state laws and regulations, as well as by general industry practices. The Company s reinsurance subsidiary, Osprey, which was incorporated on , is licensed as a Class 3A Insurer under The Bermuda Insurance Act 1978 and related regulations. Osprey is required to meet and maintain certain minimum levels of solvency and liquidity. Each year Osprey is required to file with the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the Authority a Capital and Solvency Return, Statutory Financial Return and Audited Financial Statements within four months of its relevant financial year end. Osprey maintains sufficient collateral to comply with regulatory requirements as of December 31, 2022. Bermuda s standard for financial statement reporting is U.S. GAAP.

 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) that are designed to assure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 As required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and fraud. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management s override of the control. 
 The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 As of December 31, 2022, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, or 2013 Framework. Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. 
 Plante Moran, PLLC, the independent registered public accounting firm who also audited the Company s consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, has issued their attestation report on the Company s internal control over financial reporting presented in Part IV, Item 15 of this report under Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
