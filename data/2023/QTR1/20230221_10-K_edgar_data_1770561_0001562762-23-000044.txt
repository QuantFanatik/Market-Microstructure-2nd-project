 CAUTIONARY NOTICE REGARDING FORWARD 
-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Annual 
Report on 
Form 10-K 
contains forward-looking 
statements within 
the meaning 
of Section 
27A of 
 the Securities Act 
of 1933, as 
amended, or the 
Securities Act, and 
Section 21E of 
the Securities Exchange 
Act 
 of 
1934, 
as 
amended, 
or 
the 
Exchange 
Act, 
concerning 
our 
business, 
operations, 
financial 
performance 
and 
 condition, the coal, steel and other industries, as well as our plans, 
objectives and expectations for our business, 
 operations, financial performance and condition. Forward-looking statements may 
be identified by words such 
as 
 may, 
 could, 
 believes, 
 estimates, 
 expects, 
 intends, 
 plans, 
 anticipate, 
 forecast, 
 outlook, 
 target, 
 likely, considers 
and other similar words. 
 Any 
forward-looking 
statements 
involve 
known 
and 
unknown 
risks, 
uncertainties, 
assumptions 
and 
other 
 important factors that 
could cause actual 
results, performance, 
events or outcomes 
to differ 
materially from 
the 
 results, 
performance, 
events 
or 
outcomes 
expressed 
or 
anticipated 
in 
these 
statements, 
many 
of 
which 
are 
 beyond 
our 
control. 
Such 
forward-looking 
statements 
are 
based 
on 
an 
assessment 
of 
present 
economic 
and 
 operating 
conditions 
on 
a 
number 
of 
best 
estimate 
assumptions 
regarding 
future 
events 
and 
actions. 
These 
 factors are difficult to accurately predict and may be beyond our control. Factors that could affect our results, our 
 announced plans or an investment in our securities include, 
but are not limited to: 
 
the prices we receive for our coal; 
 
uncertainty in 
global economic 
conditions, 
including the 
extent, duration 
and impact 
of the 
Russia 
 and Ukraine 
war, 
as well 
as risks 
related to 
government actions 
with respect 
to trade 
agreements, 
 treaties or policies; 
 
a decrease in the availability or increase in costs of key supplies, capital equipment or commodities, 
 such as diesel fuel, steel, explosives and tires; 
 
the extensive 
forms of 
taxation that our 
mining operations are 
subject to, 
and for 
future tax regulations 
 and developments. 
For 
example, the 
amendments 
to 
the coal 
royalty 
regime implemented 
by the 
 Queensland State 
Government in 
Australia introducing higher 
tiers to 
the coal 
royalty rates 
applicable 
 to our Australian Operations; 
 
severe 
financial 
hardship, 
bankruptcy, 
temporary 
or 
permanent 
shut 
downs 
or 
operational 
 challenges, due 
to future 
public health 
crisis (such 
as COVID-19 
pandemic) 
of one 
or more 
of our 
 major customers, including 
customers in the steel 
industry, 
key suppliers/contractors, which 
among 
 other 
adverse 
effects, 
could 
lead 
to 
reduced 
demand 
for 
our 
coal, 
increased 
difficulty 
collecting 
 receivables 
and 
customers 
and/or 
suppliers 
asserting 
force 
majeure 
or 
other 
reasons 
for 
not 
 performing their contractual obligations to us; 
 
our ability to generate sufficient cash to service 
our indebtedness and other obligations; 
 
our 
indebtedness 
and 
ability 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
covenants 
and 
other 
undertakings 
under 
the 
 agreements governing such indebtedness; 
 
our ability to 
collect payments 
from our customers 
depending on 
their creditworthiness, 
contractual 
 performance or otherwise; 
 
the demand for steel products, which impacts the demand for 
our metallurgical, or Met, coals;

risks 
inherent 
to 
mining 
operations 
could 
impact 
the 
amount 
of 
coal 
produced, 
cause 
delay 
or 
 suspend coal deliveries, or increase the cost of operating 
our business; 
 
the loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our 
largest customers; 
 
risks 
unique 
to 
international 
mining 
and 
trading 
operations, 
including 
tariffs 
and 
other 
barriers 
to 
 trade; 
 
unfavorable economic and financial market conditions; 
 
our ability to continue acquiring and developing coal reserves 
that are economically recoverable; 
 
uncertainties in estimating our economically recoverable coal 
reserves; 
 
transportation for our coal becoming unavailable or uneconomic 
for our customers; 
 
the risk that we may be required to pay for unused capacity pursuant to the terms of our take-or-pay 
 arrangements with rail and port operators; 
 
our ability to retain key personnel and attract qualified 
personnel; 
 
any failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations; 
 
our ability to obtain, renew or maintain permits and consents 
necessary for our operations; 
 
potential costs or 
liability under applicable environmental 
laws and regulations, 
including with respect 
 to any exposure 
to hazardous substances 
caused by 
our operations, as 
well as any 
environmental 
 contamination our 
properties may have or our operations may cause; 
 
extensive regulation of our mining operations and future 
regulations and developments; 
 
our ability to provide 
appropriate financial assurances 
for our obligations under 
applicable laws and 
 regulations; 
 
assumptions underlying our asset retirement obligations 
for reclamation and mine closures; 
 
concerns about the environmental impacts of coal combustion, 
including possible impacts on global 
 climate issues, 
which could 
result in 
increased regulation 
of coal 
combustion 
and requirements 
to 
 reduce 
greenhouse 
gas, 
or 
GHG, 
emissions 
in 
many 
jurisdictions, 
which 
could 
significantly 
affect 
 demand for our products or our securities and reduced 
access to capital and insurance; 
 
any cyber-attacks or 
other security breaches that 
disrupt our operations 
or result in 
the dissemination 
 of proprietary or confidential information about us, our 
customers or other third parties; 
 
the risk that we may not 
recover our investments in 
our mining, exploration and other 
assets, which 
 may require us to recognize impairment charges related 
to those assets; 
 
risks related to divestitures and acquisitions; 
 
the risk that diversity in 
interpretation and application of 
accounting principles in the 
mining industry 
 may impact our reported financial results; and 
 
other risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A. Risk 
Factors. 
 We 
make 
many 
of 
our 
forward-looking 
statements 
based 
on 
our 
operating 
budgets 
and 
forecasts, 
which 
are 
 based upon 
detailed assumptions. 
While we 
believe that 
our assumptions 
are reasonable, 
we caution 
that it 
is 
 very difficult to 
predict the impact 
of known factors, 
and it is 
impossible for us 
to anticipate all 
factors that could 
 affect our actual results. 
 See Item 1A. Risk Factors and 
elsewhere in this Annual Report 
on Form 10-K for a more 
complete discussion 
 of the risks 
and uncertainties 
mentioned above 
and for 
discussion of other 
risks and 
uncertainties we 
face that 
 could 
cause 
actual 
results 
to 
differ 
materially 
from 
those 
expressed 
or 
implied 
by 
these 
forward-looking 
 statements.

 All 
forward-looking 
statements 
attributable 
to 
us 
are 
expressly 
qualified 
in 
their 
entirety 
by 
these 
cautionary 
 statements, as well as others made in this Annual 
Report on Form 10-K and hereafter in our other 
filings with the 
 Securities 
and 
Exchange 
Commission, 
or 
SEC, 
and 
public 
communications. 
You 
should 
evaluate 
all 
 forward-looking statements made by us in the context 
of these risks and uncertainties. 
 We caution you that the risks and uncertainties identified by us may not be all of the factors that are important to 
 you. 
You 
should 
not 
interpret 
the 
disclosure 
of 
any 
risk 
to 
imply 
that 
the 
risk 
has 
not 
already 
materialized. 
 Furthermore, the forward 
-looking statements 
included in this 
Annual Report on 
Form 10-K 
are made only 
as of 
 the date hereof. 
We undertake no 
obligation to publicly 
update or revise 
any forward-looking statement as 
a result 
 of new information, future events, or otherwise, except 
as required by applicable law. 
 Forward-looking and 
other statements 
in this 
Annual Report 
on Form 
10-K regarding 
our GHG 
reduction plans 
 and 
goals 
are 
not 
an 
indication 
that 
these 
statements 
are 
necessarily 
material 
to 
investors 
or 
required 
to 
be 
 disclosed in our filings with the SEC. In addition, historical, current and forward 
-looking GHG-related statements 
 may be based on standards for measuring 
progress that are still developing, internal controls and 
processes that 
 continue to evolve and assumptions that are subject to change 
in the future.

 PART I 
 ITEM 1. 
BUSINESS. 
 Overview 
 We 
are 
a 
leading 
producer, 
global 
marketer 
and 
exporter 
of 
a 
full 
range 
of 
Met 
coals. 
We 
own 
a 
portfolio 
of 
 operating 
mines 
and 
development 
projects 
in 
Queensland 
in 
Australia, 
and 
in 
Virginia, 
West 
Virginia 
and 
 Pennsylvania 
in 
the 
United 
States. 
We 
are 
one 
of 
the 
largest 
Met 
coal 
producers 
globally 
by 
export 
volume, 
 serving customers on five continents. 
 Our operations in Australia, or our Australian 
Operations, consist of the 100 -owned 
Curragh producing mining 
 property located 
in the 
Bowen Basin 
of Australia. 
Our operations 
in the 
United States, 
or our 
U.S. Operations, 
 consist 
of 
two 
producing 
mining 
properties 
(Buchanan 
and 
Logan), 
one 
temporarily 
idled 
mining 
property 
 (Greenbrier) and two 
development mining 
properties (Mon 
Valley, 
and Russell County), 
primarily located 
in the 
 Central Appalachian 
region of 
the United 
States, or 
CAPP, 
all of 
which are 
100 -owned. Our 
U.S. Operations 
 and Australian Operations 
are strategically located for 
access to transportation 
infrastructure. In addition 
to Met 
 coal, our Australian Operations sell thermal coal under a long-term legacy contract assumed in the acquisition of 
 Curragh, 
which 
is 
used 
to 
generate 
electricity, 
to 
Stanwell 
Corporation 
Limited, 
or 
Stanwell, 
a 
Queensland 
 government-owned 
entity 
and 
the 
operator 
of 
the 
Stanwell 
Power 
Station 
located 
near 
Rockhampton, 
 Queensland, 
and 
some 
thermal 
coal 
in 
the 
export 
market. 
Our 
U.S. 
Operations 
also 
produce 
and 
sell 
some 
 thermal coal that is extracted in the process of mining 
Met coal. 
 Location of Australian Operations 

 Location of U.S. Operations 
 Our core business 
strategy focuses 
on the production 
of Met coal 
for the North 
American and seaborne 
export 
 markets. 
Met 
coal 
is 
a 
key 
ingredient 
in 
the 
production 
of 
steel 
using 
blast 
furnaces, 
and 
approximately 
770 
 kilograms of Met coal is required to produce one ton of steel. 
 We 
have 
a 
geographically 
diverse 
customer 
base 
across 
a range 
of 
global 
markets. 
Major 
consumers 
of 
our 
 seaborne Met coal in 2022 were located in high-growth Asian markets, Brazil 
and Europe. These consumers are 
 all major 
global steel or 
Met coke producers. 
We are well-positioned 
in the 
key high-growth Asian 
markets (Japan, 
 South 
Korea 
and 
India) 
as 
sales 
to 
direct 
end 
users 
in 
the 
region 
represented 
56.9 
of 
our 
total 
revenue, 
 including Tata 
Steel Limited, or Tata 
Steel, which accounted for 19.4 of total revenue, 
in 2022. 
 The 
charts 
below 
show 
our 
direct 
sales

 History and Australian Public Offering 
 We were 
founded in 
2011 
by our 
current Chief 
Executive Officer, 
Mr. 
Garold Spindler, 
our then 
President and 
 Chief 
Operating 
Officer, 
Mr. 
James 
Campbell 
and 
a 
private 
equity 
fund 
affiliated 
with 
The 
Energy 
Minerals 
 Group, or EMG, with the intention of evaluating, acquiring 
and developing Met coal mining properties. 

 Prior to the initial public 
offering, 
Coronado Global Resources 
Inc., was a wholly-owned subsidiary 
of Coronado 
 Group LLC, which 
is currently 
owned by 
funds managed 
by EMG, 
which we 
refer to, 
collectively, 
as the 
EMG 
 Group, and certain members of our management. 
 On 
October 23, 
2018, 
we 
completed 
an 
initial 
public 
offering 
on 
the 
Australian 
Securities 
Exchange, 
or 
ASX, 
 which we refer to as the Australian IPO. 
 As of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
EMG Group 
and 
management 
beneficially 
owned 
approximately 
50.4 
of the 
 issued 
and 
outstanding 
shares 
of 
our 
common 
stock 
through 
their 
ownership 
of 
Coronado 
Group LLC. 
The 
 remaining 49.6 
was owned 
by public 
investors in 
the form 
of CDIs traded 
on the ASX.

 Overview of Operations 
 Met Coal 
 Met coal is primarily 
used in the manufacture of 
coke, which is used 
in the steel-making process, as 
well as direct 
 injection into a blast furnace as a replacement for coke. 
 Sales of Met coal represented approximately 95.3 
 of our total coal revenues for the year ended December 31, 
 2022. Most of the Met coal 
that we produce is sold, directly 
or indirectly, 
to steel producers. The steel 
industry s 
 demand 
for 
Met 
coal 
is 
affected 
by 
several 
factors, 
including 
the 
cyclical 
nature 
of 
that 
industry s 
business, 
 geopolitical stability, 
general economic conditions affecting 
demand for steel, tariffs 
on steel and steel products, 
 technological developments in the steelmaking process and the availability and 
cost of substitutes for steel, such 
 as aluminum, 
composites and 
plastics. We 
compete based 
on coal quality 
and characteristics, 
price, customer 
 service and support 
and reliability of supply. 
Seaborne Met coal 
import demand, which 
is most of our 
business, 
 can be significantly impacted by the availability of indigenous coal production, particularly in the 
leading Met coal 
 import 
countries 
of 
China 
and 
India, 
among 
others, 
and 
the 
competitiveness 
of 
seaborne 
Met 
coal 
supply, 
 including 
from 
the 
leading 
Met 
coal 
exporting 
countries 
of 
Australia, 
the 
United 
States, 
Russia, 
Canada 
and 
 Mongolia, 
among 
others.
 In 
2022, 
the 
seaborne 
Met 
coal 
market 
was 
considerably 
volatile, 
driven 
by 
supply 
 concerns in 
key Met 
coal 
markets and 
continued 
trade flow 
disruptions 
due to 
sanctions imposed 
on Russian 
 coal imports following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
 Thermal Coal 
 Sales of thermal 
coal represented approximately 
4.7 of our 
total coal revenues 
for the year 
ended December 
 31, 2022. 
The thermal 
coal we 
produce is 
predominantly a 
byproduct of 
mining Met 
coal. The 
thermal coal 
we 

Table of Contents 
 Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 
2022 
11 
 produce 
is 
sold, 
directly 
or 
indirectly, 
to 
power 
stations, 
predominantly 
Stanwell, 
as 
an 
energy 
source 
in 
the 
 generation 
of 
electricity. 
Demand 
for 
our 
thermal 
coal 
products 
is 
impacted 
by 
economic 
conditions, 
 environmental regulations, demand for 
electricity, including 
the impact of energy efficient 
products, and the cost 
 of electricity 
generation 
from 
alternative 
fuels. 
Our 
thermal 
coal 
products 
primarily 
compete 
with 
producers 
of 
 other forms of electric generation, 
including natural gas, oil, nuclear, hydro, wind, solar 
and biomass, that provide 
 an alternative 
to coal 
use.
 The Russian 
invasion of 
Ukraine impacted 
global supply 
dynamics 
resulting in 
Met 
 coal crossover trades into the thermal market caused 
by increased thermal coal pricing. 
 Segments 
 In accordance with 
Accounting Standards Codification, or 
ASC, Topic 280, 
 Segment Reporting
 , we have 
adopted 
 the following reporting segments: 
 
Australia; and 
 
United States. 
 In addition, Other and Corporate is not determined 
to be a reporting segment but is disclosed 
for the purposes 
 of reconciliation to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 These segments are grouped based on geography and reflect how we currently monitor 
and report the results of 
 the business to 
the Chief Executive 
Officer who is 
our chief operating 
decision maker, or CODM. 
Factors affecting 
 and 
differentiating 
the 
financial 
performance 
of 
each 
of these 
two 
reportable 
segments 
generally 
include 
coal 
 quality, 
geology, 
coal 
marketing 
opportunities, 
mining 
and 
transportation 
methods 
and 
regulatory 
issues. 
We 
 believe 
this 
method 
of 
segment 
reporting 
reflects 
the 
way 
our 
business 
segments 
are 
currently 
managed, 
 resources are allocated and 
the way the performance 
of each segment is evaluated. 
The two segments 
consist 
 of similar operating activities as each segment produces similar 
products. 
 Diversification
 We have 
100 ownership 
over all 
of our 
operating mines, 
allowing us 
full control 
over all 
operating decisions. 
 This 
control 
is 
critical 
during 
times 
of 
crisis 
and 
allows 
us 
to 
react 
swiftly 
and 
decisively 
to 
changes 
in 
global 
 market demands. 

 We benefit from a geographically 
diverse asset base, 
in Australia and the United States, 
with access to multiple 
 transportation infrastructure options, including key rail and port infrastructure, providing access to both seaborne 
 export and domestic markets. 
We have access to 
the key major markets 
in both the Atlantic and 
Pacific basins, 
 and our wide footprint provides flexibility to respond quickly 
to changes in global market demands. 
 Sanctions 
and 
bans 
on 
Russian 
coal 
resulted 
in 
European 
countries 
seeking 
alternative 
sources 
which 
also 
 resulted in Met coal cross trades in the thermal markets, as producers looked to benefit from the price 
arbitrage. 
 The low cost 
nature of our 
assets is a 
function of the 
quality of the 
assets and the 
available mine infrastructure 
 to extract our 
reserves efficiently. 
Being geographically 
diverse allows us 
to sell products 
to our customers 
in a 
 number of countries. This allows the sales team to leverage these relationships to provide value added solutions 
 such as blends with third parties, which is margin accretive. 
 Our Met 
coal production is 
diversified across high 
quality products, 
such as 
hard coking coal, 
or HCC, 
semi coking 
 coals, 
or 
SCC, 
and 
pulverized 
coal 
injection, 
or 
PCI, 
coal 
from 
our 
Australian 
Operations, 
and 
significant 
 production of HCC, comprising high volatile content, 
or High-Vol, 
(including sub-category A of High-Vol 
, 
or HVA, 
 and sub-category B of High-Vol, 
or HVB), coal with medium 
volatile content, or Mid-Vol, and coal with low 
volatile 
 content, 
or 
Low-Vol, 
coals 
from 
our 
U.S. 
Operations. 
This 
broad 
product 
range 
supports 
a 
wide 
variety 
of 
 customer 
requirements 
and 
various 
blending 
opportunities, 
being 
valued 
for 
its 
attractive 
coke-making 
 characteristics. 
 The below charts 
show Met 
product ranges 
for our Australian 
Operations and 
our U.S. 
Operations for 
the year 
 ended December 31, 2022.

 We 
have a 
dedicated 
global 
marketing 
team 
that 
generates 
direct sales 
for our 
Met coal. 
Our 
customer 
base 
 spans across a full 
spectrum of key 
global markets. We 
sell directly to a 
number of large, 
high-quality and well-
 known 
companies 
in 
the 
steel 
industry 
globally. 
Many 
of 
our 
core 
customers 
have 
been 
our 
longstanding 
 customers for over 20 years, 
and source our products as essential base load, 
which translates into a long history 
 of contract 
renewal for 
such customers. 
We are 
a major 
supplier to 
tier one 
steel mills 
in Japan, 
South Korea, 
 Taiwan, 
India, 
Europe, 
Brazil, 
North 
America 
and 
China. 
Given 
the 
quality 
of 
our 
diverse 
customer 
base, 
we 
 believe the 
demand for 
our products 
is fundamentally 
insulated across 
all stages 
of the 
commodity cycle. 
This 
 flexibility provides us the ability to take advantage of favorable 
market pricing as and where it arises. 
 2022 Coronado s coal trade flows 
 Overview of Australian Operations Curragh 
 Curragh is located in 
Queensland s Bowen Basin, one of the 
world s premier Met coal regions. Curragh 
has been 
 operating since 
1983, and 
produces a 
variety of 
high-quality, 
low-ash Met 
coal products. 
We believe 
our HCC 
 product 
is 
recognized 
by 
steelmakers 
for 
its 
low-ash 
content, 
consistency 
of 
quality 
and 
favorable 
coking 
 attributes. We believe that 
our SCC products are similarly 
valued, in particular for 
their low wall pressure, which 
 makes them suitable for stamp charging coke 
ovens, and our PCI coal at Curragh 
is recognized by steelmakers 
 for its low phosphorus and sulphur content. These Met 
coal products are exported globally to a diverse customer 
 base located primarily in Asia. 
Curragh also produces thermal 
coal, 
which is primarily sold domestically 
under a 
 long-term contract with Stanwell, with a limited amount 
being exported.

 Thermal
 Revenues from our Australian Operations represented 
59.3 of our total revenue for the year ended December 
 31, 2022. See Item 2. Properties for more information regarding 
Curragh. 

 For the year ended December 31, 2022, 65.3 of the total 
volume of coal sold by our Australian Operations was 
 Met coal and 34.7 of the 
total volume of coal sold 
by our Australian Operations 
was thermal coal, the majority 
 of which is sold to 
Stanwell. For the year 
ended December 31, 2022, 
Curragh sold 6.3
 MMt of Met coal 
into the 
 seaborne coal 
markets. The 
majority 
of customers 
purchase 
multiple grades 
or products 
and have 
purchased 
 Curragh coal continuously through all stages of the coal/commodity 
pricing cycle. Curragh s Met coal is typically 
 sold 
on 
annual 
contracts 
negotiated 
by 
our 
Australian 
Operations 
sales 
managers, 
with 
pricing 
agreed 
to 
 bilaterally or with reference 
to benchmark indices 
or spot indices. Our 
Australian Operations have 
maintained a 
 high level of contract 
coverage against planned production. In 
2022, 
substantially all of Curragh s Met 
coal export 
 sales were made under term contracts. 
 Overview of U.S. Operations Buchanan and Logan 
 Our producing mining properties in the United States 
are located in the CAPP region, specifically in Virginia 
and 
 West 
Virginia, 
which 
is 
a 
highly-developed, 
active, 
coal-producing 
region. 
Met 
coal 
produced 
by 
our 
U.S. 
 Operations is consumed regionally by North American steel producers or 
exported by seaborne transportation to 
 steel producers 
(primarily in Asia, 
Europe and South 
America). The U.S. 
Operations also 
produce small quantities 
 of thermal coal 
that is extracted 
in the process 
of mining Met 
coal, which is 
sold predominantly to 
global export 
 markets, as well 
as within North 
America.
 We believe 
that many regard 
Met coal from 
the CAPP region 
(where 
 our 
U.S. 
Operations 
are 
located) 
to 
be 
of 
the 
highest 
quality 
in 
the 
world 
owing 
to 
its 
generally 
low-ash 
and 
 sulphur 
content. 
Our 
U.S. 
Operations 
offer 
a 
range 
of 
Met 
coal 
products, 
with 
significant 
production 
of 
HCC, 
 comprising coal wth High-Vol 
(including HVA 
and HVB), coal with Mid-Vol, 
and coal with Low-Vol. 
 Sales from our U.S. 
Operations to export 
markets are typically 
priced with reference 
to a benchmark index. 
We 
 generally sell our 
seaborne coal through 
intermediaries Free 
on Rail (Incoterms 
2010), or FOR, 
and, therefore, 
 our realized price on FOR sales does not 
include transportation to the seaborne port 
or costs to transload into a 
 vessel. Consistent 
with seaborne sales, 
sales to North 
American customers 
are generally sold 
on a FOR 
basis 
 where the customer arrangers for and incurs the cost 
of transportation to their facility. 

 A portion of our sales is 
sold to North American steel and coke producers on annual contracts at 
fixed prices that 
 do 
not 
fluctuate 
with 
the 
benchmark 
index. 
The 
fixed-price 
nature 
of 
these 
annual 
contracts 
provides 
us 
with 
 visibility on our future revenues, as compared to spot sales or sales priced with reference to a benchmark index. 
 For 2023, we have entered into annual contracts to sell approximately 1.6 MMt Met coal to North American steel 
 and coke producers. 
During periods of 
stable and rising 
prices, we strive 
to take advantage 
of the spot 
market. 
 Spot export contracts are negotiated throughout the year. Revenues from our U.S. Operations, in the aggregate, 
 represented 40.7 
 of our total revenue 
for the year ended 
December 31, 2022. See 
Item 2. Properties for more 
 information regarding Buchanan, 
Logan and the other mining properties that compose our 
U.S. Operations.

 Customers 
 We sell 
most of our 
coal to 
steel producers, 
either directly 
or through 
intermediaries, such 
as brokers. 
We also 
 sell 
thermal 
coal 
to 
electricity 
generators 
either 
directly 
or 
through 
intermediaries 
such 
as 
brokers. 
Major 
 consumers of our 
seaborne Met 
coal in 2022 
were located 
in India, China, 
Japan, South 
Korea, Taiwan, 
Brazil 
 and Europe. 
These consumers 
are all 
major global 
steel or 
Met coke 
producers. The 
majority of 
our sales 
are 
 made under contracts with terms of typically one year 
or on a spot basis. 

 Tata 
Steel 
 Our U.S. Operations 
and Australian Operations 
are parties to 
Long Term 
Coal Sale and 
Purchase Agreements 
 with TS 
Global Procurement 
Company Pte 
Ltd, or 
Tata 
Steel, 
with ending 
March 31, 
2025. These 
Long Term 
 Agreements provide for 
the sale of a 
minimum aggregate total 
of 2.25 MMt of 
coal per contract 
year across the 
 Group, consisting of 
certain specific quantities 
of HCC, and 
pulverized coal 
injection, or PCI, 
Coal. 
The coal 
is 
 sold Free on 
Board (Incoterms 2020), 
or FOB, priced 
with reference to 
benchmark indices and 
the agreements 
 contain industry 
standard terms 
and conditions 
with respect 
to delivery,

 Xcoal 
 In 2022, 
we 
sold 
1.9 
MMt 
of coal 
to 
Xcoal 
Energy 
Resources 
LLC, 
or Xcoal, 
from 
our U.S. 
Operations. 
Coal 
 revenues from Xcoal represented 28.4 
 of coal revenues 
from our U.S. Operations. Purchase orders with Xcoal 
 are entered 
into primarily on 
an ad hoc 
(shipment-by-shipment) basis. 
Xcoal, as 
well as most 
other customers, 
 typically 
take 
ownership 
of 
coal 
upon 
loading 
into 
the 
rail 
car 
(FOR) 
and 
are 
responsible 
for 
handling 
 transportation logistics to the port and beyond. 

 Stanwell 
 We are 
party to 
contractual arrangements 
with Stanwell, 
including a 
Coal Supply 
Agreement, or 
the CSA, 
and 
 the Curragh Mine New Coal Supply Deed, dated August 
14, 2018, or the Supply Deed. 
 Under the CSA, we deliver thermal coal from Curragh to Stanwell at an agreed price and quantity. 
Stanwell may 
 vary the quantity of thermal coal purchased each year so the total quantity to be delivered to Stanwell each year 
 cannot 
be 
precisely 
forecast. 
The coal 
that 
we 
supply 
to Stanwell 
constitutes 
the 
majority 
of the 
thermal 
coal 
 production from Curragh. Our cost of supplying coal to Stanwell has 
been greater than the contracted price paid 
 by Stanwell during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 
for prior years. 

 Under the CSA, we also 
share part of the revenue earned from 
export Met coal sales (from particular Tenements 
 (as defined below)) 
with Stanwell 
through various 
rebates. The 
most material 
rebate is 
the export 
price rebate, 
 which is linked to the realized export coal price for a defined 
Met coal product, as follows: 
 
For the 
first 7.0 MMtpa 
of export 
coal sales: when 
the 12-month trailing, 
weighted-average realized export 
 coal price of Reference coal exceeds the Tier 
1 Rebate Coal Floor Price, we pay a rebate 
of 25 of the 
 difference between the realized export coal price and 
the Tier 1 Rebate Coal Floor 
Price. 
 
For export 
coal sales 
above 7.0 
MMtpa: when 
the 12-month 
trailing, weighted-average 
realized export 
 coal price of Reference coal exceeds the Tier 
2 Rebate Coal Floor Price, we pay a rebate 
of 10 of the 
 difference between the realized export coal price and 
the Tier 2 Rebate Coal Floor 
Price. 
 The CSA also provides for: 
 
a tonnage rebate to Stanwell per Mt on the first 7.0 MMtpa of export coal sales and 
on export coal sales 
 above 7.0 MMtpa; and 
 
a rebate on run-of-mine, or ROM, coal mined in the Curragh Pit U 
East Area. 
 The total Stanwell 
rebate for the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2022, was 166.0
 million and has 
been included in 
 the 
Consolidated 
Statements 
of 
Operations 
and 
Comprehensive 
Income 
included 
elsewhere 
in 
this 
Annual 
 Report on Form 10-K. 
 The Supply 
Deed grants 
us the 
right to 
mine the 
coal reserves 
in the 
Stanwell Reserved 
Area, or 
the SRA. 
In 
 exchange, we agreed to certain amendments to the CSA and to 
enter into a New Coal Supply Agreement, or the 
 NCSA upon the 
expiration of the 
CSA (which is 
expected to occur 
in 2027). 
On July 12, 
2019, we entered 
into 
 the 
NCSA 
with 
Stanwell. 
From 
the 
earlier 
of 
the 
expiry 
of 
the 
CSA, 
the 
date 
of 
termination 
of 
the 
CSA, 
and 
 January 1, 2029, we 
will continue to supply 
thermal coal to 
Stanwell under the 
NCSA. The term of 
the NCSA is 
 expected to be 10 years, 
and Coronado will supply 
to Stanwell 2 million Tonnes 
Equivalent of thermal coal 
per 
 annum (based 
on a 
nominal gross 
calorific value 
of 25.6GJ) 
at a

 Transportation 
 Coal produced 
at 
our mining 
properties 
is transported 
to customers 
by a 
combination 
of road, 
rail, 
barge 
and 
 ship. See Item 2. Properties 
for descriptions of the transportation infrastructure 
available to each of our mining 
 properties. Rail 
and port 
services 
are typically 
contracted 
on a 
long-term, 
take-or-pay basis 
in Australia, 
while 
 these contracts 
are typically 
negotiated on 
a quarterly 
basis in 
the United 
States. 
See Item 7. 
 Management s 
 Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources for 
 additional information on our take-or-pay obligations. 
 Australian Operations 
 Our Australian 
Operations 
typically sell 
export coal 
FOB, with 
the customer 
paying for 
transportation 
from the 
 outbound shipping port. 
The majority of 
Curragh s export 
Met coal is railed 
approximately 300 kilometers 
to the 
 Port of 
Gladstone for export 
via two main 
port terminals, RG 
Tanna Coal Terminal, 
or RGTCT, and Wiggins Island 
 Coal Export Terminal, 
or WICET. 
Curragh also has capacity available 
to stockpile coal at the Port 
of Gladstone. 
 For 
sales 
of 
thermal 
coal 
to 
Stanwell, 
Stanwell 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
transport 
of 
coal 
to 
the 
Stanwell 
Power 
 Station.

 Curragh is 
linked to 
the Blackwater 
rail line 
of the 
Central Queensland

or CQCN, 
an integrated 
 coal 
haulage 
rail system 
owned 
and 
operated 
by 
Aurizon

 or Pacific National. 

 The RGTCT Coal 
Transport Services 
Agreement with Aurizon 
Operations is for 
8.5
 MMtpa of haulage 
capacity 
 to RGTCT. Curragh pays a minimum monthly charge (components of which are payable on a take-or-pay basis), 
 which is calculated with reference 
to the below-rail access charges, 
haulage/freight charges, a minimum

This contract is effectively 
100 take-or-pay (for a 
portion of the rail haulage 
and 
 all capacity access charges). This agreement expires on June 
30, 2030. 
 Port Services 
 Curragh exports coal 
through two terminals 
at the Port 
of Gladstone, RGTCT 
and WICET. 
At RGTCT, 
Curragh 
 and

Port 
Corporation 
Limited, 
or GPC, 
are 
parties 
to 
a 
coal 
handling 
agreement 
that 
expires 
on 
 June 30, 2030. 
The agreement may 
be renewed 
at our 
request and, 
subject to certain 
conditions, GPC is required 
 to agree 
to the 
extension 
if there 
is capacity 
at RGTCT 
to allow 
the extension. 
We currently 
have the 
right 
to 
 export between 7.7 MMtpa and 8.7 MMtpa at our nomination 
on a take-or-pay basis. 
 We have 
a minority 
interest 
in WICET 
Holdings 
Pty Ltd, whose 
wholly-owned 
subsidiary, 
Wiggins Island 
Coal 
 Export Terminal 
Pty Ltd, or WICET Pty Ltd, owns WICET. 
Other coal producers who export coal through WICET 
 also hold 
shares 
in 
WICET 
Holdings 
Pty Ltd. 
In addition, 
we and 
the 
other 
coal 
producers 
(or 
shippers) 
have 
 take-or-pay agreements with WICET Pty 
Ltd and pay a terminal handling charge 
to export coal through WICET, 
 which is 
calculated 
by reference 
to WICET s 
annual operating 
costs, as 
well as 
finance costs 
associated with 
 WICET 
Pty Ltd s 
external 
debt 
facilities.

 Take 
-or-Pay 
Agreement, 
provides 
Curragh 
with 
export 
capacity 
of 
1.5 
MMtpa. 
The 
WICET 
Take 
-or-Pay 
 Agreement is an evergreen 
agreement, with rolling ten-year 
terms. If we inform 
WICET Pty Ltd that we 
do not 
 wish to continue to roll the term 
of the WICET Take 
-or-Pay Agreement, the term would 
be set at nine years and 
 the terminal handling 
charge payable 
by us would 
be increased so 
that our 
proportion of WICET 
Pty Ltd s debt 
 is amortized to nil by the end of that nine-year term. 
 Under 
the 
WICET 
Take 
-or-Pay 
Agreement, 
we 
are 
obligated 
to 
pay 
for 
that 
capacity 
via 
terminal 
handling 
 charges, whether utilized or not. The terminal handling charge payable by us can be adjusted by WICET 
Pty Ltd 
 if 
our 
share 
of 
WICET 
Pty Ltd s 
operational 
and 
finance 
costs 
increases, 
including 
because 
of 
increased 
 operational costs or because another shipper defaults 
and has its capacity reduced to nil. The terminal handling 
 charge is subject 
to a financing 
cap set out 
in the terminal 
handling charge methodology 
and has already 
been 
 reached and 
is in force. 
If another shipper 
defaults under 
its take-or-pay 
agreement, each 
remaining shipper 
is 
 effectively proportionately liable to pay that defaulting shipper s share of WICET Pty Ltd s costs going forward, in 
 the form of increased terminal handling charges. 
 If we default under the 
WICET Take 
-or-Pay Agreement, we would 
be obligated to pay a 
termination payment to 
 WICET 
Pty Ltd. 
The 
termination 
payment 
effectively 
represents 
our 
proportion 
of 
WICET 
Pty Ltd s 
total 
debt 
 outstanding, based 
on the 
proportion of 
our contracted 
tonnage to 
the total 
contracted 
tonnage of 
shippers 
at 
 WICET at 
the time 
the payment 
is triggered. 
Shippers can 
also become 
liable to 
pay the 
termination 
payment 
 where there is a permanent cessation of operations at WICET. 
Since WICET began shipping export tonnages in 
 April 
2015, 
four 
WICET 
Holdings 
Pty Ltd 
shareholders 
have 
entered 
into 
administration 
and 
Take 
-or-Pay 
 Agreements subsequently terminated, resulting 
in the aggregate 
contracted tonnage of shippers 
decreasing from 
 27 MMtpa to 15.5 MMtpa.
 Under the WICET Take 
-or-Pay Agreement, we are required 
to provide security (which is 
provided in the form of 
 a bank guarantee). The amount of 
the security must cover our estimated liabilities as 
a shipper under the WICET 
 Take 
-or-Pay Agreement for the following twelve-month period. If 
we are in default under 
the WICET Take-or-Pay 
 Agreement and 
are subject 
to a 
termination payment, 
WICET Pty Ltd 
can draw 
on the 
security and 
apply it 
to 
 amounts 
owing 
by us.

with 
customers 
bearing 
the 
 transportation costs from 
the mine to the 
applicable end user. 
For direct sales to 
export customers, we hold 
the 
 transportation 
contract 
and 
are 
responsible 
for 
the

are made 
through Xcoal and 
other intermediaries. For 
these sales, Xcoal 
or the 
intermediary typically 
 take ownership of 
the coal as 
it is loaded 
into the railcar. The intermediary 
is responsible for 
the rail transportation 
 and port costs. 
 Rail Services 
 Our U.S. Operations 
are served by 
Northfork Southern

net 
 tons per 
year through 
Kinder Morgan s 
Pier IX 
Terminal 
to the 
end of 
March 2024. 
On March 
1, 2022, 
we re-
 assigned 
700,000

to 
Xcoal 
for 
a 
consideration, 
reducing 
our 
dedicated

with an option to extend for an additional three 
 years, for a dedicated inventory 
capacity and take-or-pay obligation 
to transload 650,000 net tons 
per year. 
Our 
 U.S. Operations also have alternate port access through CNX Marine Terminal which is a transshipping terminal 
 at the Port of Baltimore owned by CONSOL Energy. 
 Suppliers 
 The principal 
goods we 
purchase 
in support 
of our 
mining activities 
are mining 
equipment, replacement 
parts, 
 diesel fuel, natural gas, ammonium-nitrate 
and emulsion-based explosives, off 
-road tires, steel-related products 
 (including roof control materials), lubricants and electricity. 
As a general matter, we have many well-established, 
 strategic relationships 
with our 
key suppliers 
of goods 
and do not 
believe that 
we are 
dependent on 
any of 
our 
 individual suppliers. 
 We 
also 
depend 
on 
several 
major 
pieces 
of 
mining 
equipment 
and 
facilities 
to 
produce 
and 
transport 
coal, 
 including, but not limited to, longwall mining systems, 
continuous miners, draglines, dozers, excavators, shovels, 
 haul trucks, conveyors, 
coal preparation plants, 
or CPPs, and 
rail loading and 
blending facilities. Obtaining 
and 
 repairing these 
major pieces 
of equipment and 
facilities often 
involves long 
lead times. 
We strive 
to extend 
the 
 lives of existing equipment and facilities through maintenance practices and equipment rebuilds in order to defer 
 the requirement for larger capital purchases. We use our global leverage with major suppliers 
to support security 
 of 
supply 
to 
meet 
the 
requirements 
of 
our 
active 
mines.

 and/or outside contractors to perform. 
 Competition 
 We operate 
in a competitive 
environment. We 
compete with domestic 
and international coal 
producers, traders 
 and brokers. 
We compete on price, coal quality, transportation, optionality, reputation and reliability. Demand for 
 Met coal and the prices that we will be able to obtain 
for our Met coal are highly competitive and 
are determined 
 predominantly by 
world markets, 
which are 
affected by 
numerous factors 
beyond our 
control, including 
but not 
 limited to: 

general global, regional and local economic activity; 
 
changes in demand for steel and energy; 
 
industrial production levels; 
 
short-term constraints, including weather incidents; 
 
changes in the supply of seaborne coal; 
 
technological changes; 
 
changes in international freight or other transportation infrastructure 
rates and costs; 
 
the costs of other commodities and substitutes for coal 
; 
 
market changes in coal quality requirements;

imposed 
by 
countries, 
including 
the 
United 
States 
and 
Australia, 
on 
the 
import 
of 
certain 
steel 
 products and any retaliatory tariffs by other countries 
; 
and 
 
tax impositions on the resources industry, 
all of which are outside of our control; 
 In addition, coal prices are highly 
dependent on the outlook for coal consumption in 
large Asian economies, such 
 as China, Japan, South Korea and India, 
as well as any changes in government 
policy regarding coal or energy 
 in those countries. 

 In developing our 
business plan and 
operating budget, we 
make certain assumptions 
regarding future Met 
coal 
 prices, coal demand and 
coal supply. The prices we receive for 
our Met coal depend on 
numerous market factors 
 beyond our control. Accordingly, 
some underlying coal price assumptions relied on by us may materially change 
 and 
actual 
coal 
prices 
and 
demand 
may 
differ 
materially 
from 
those 
expected. 
Our 
business, 
operating 
and 
 financial 
performance, 
including

flows 
and 
asset 
values, 
may 
be 
materially 
and 
adversely 
affected 
by 
 short- or long-term volatility in the prevailing prices of 
our products. 
 Competition in 
the coal 
industry is based 
on many 
factors, including, among 
others, world supply 
price, production 
 capacity, 
coal 
quality 
and 
characteristics, 
transportation 
capability 
and 
costs, 
blending 
capability,

subject to competition from 
producers in Australia, the 
United States, Canada, 
 Russia, 
Mongolia 
and 
other 
coal 
producing 
countries. 
See 
Item 1A. 
 Risk 
Factors We 
face 
significant 
 competition, which could adversely affect profitability. 
 Environmental Sustainability 
 We are focused on extracting high quality Met coal in an environmentally responsible way. 
Coal mining is one of 
 the most 
environmentally 
regulated 
industries 
in the 
world, 
and 
it is 
vital 
that 
we 
consistently 
meet 
or exceed 
 relevant regulatory standards. 
 We are subject to various environmental laws, regulations and public policies in Australia 
and the United States. 
 Managing 
our 
environment 
and 
climate 
change 
risks 
is 
a 
key 
component 
of 
our 
corporate 
strategy 
and 
it 
is 
 integrated into all stages 
and areas or our 
daily operations. We 
seek to minimize 
our environmental impact and 
 ensure we meet or exceed our legislative and regulatory 
environmental obligations.

 Climate change 

 We believe that 
climate change is 
a complex challenge 
that requires action 
at all 
levels of 
society. Climate change 
 can 
heighten 
existing 
physical 
and 
non-physical 
impacts 
and 
risks 
and 
introduce 
new 
ones 
that 
can 
affect 
 business performance in the near and long-term. 
 While our operations 
are recognized as 
vital contributors to 
the communities and 
economies in which 
we operate, 
 we acknowledge that 
our mining activities 
create Greenhouse 
Gas (GHG) 
emissions. Climate change 
is one of 
 the 
most 
significant 
issues 
for 
the 
steel 
industry 
and 
the 
industry 
has 
made 
significant 
reductions 
in 
GHG 
 emissions 
by 
improving 
energy 
efficiency 
and 
using 
new 
technologies. 
Where 
possible, 
we 
are 
continuing 
to 
 identify and 
implement GHG emissions 
and energy 
reduction opportunities across 
our business, 
whilst monitoring 
 climate related 
risks 
and the 
sustainability 
of our 
operations. 
We are 
committed to 
working with 
other industry 
 partners to 
support, develop 
and introduce 
new coal 
production and 
energy-generation technologies, 
that help 
 reduce the environmental impact while continuing to meet 
global energy and steel demands. 
 Our Australian 
Operations operate 
under an 
Environmental Management 
System, or 
EMS, in 
accordance 
with 
 ISO 14001 that contains set 
plans and procedures to ensure 
all environmental commitments are 
met. The EMS 
 is 
used 
as 
a 
tool 
to 
uphold 
our

and 
integrate 
environmental 
 compliance into 
all facets 
of the

in its Scope 1 
 and 2 emissions by 30 by 2030. 

 Emissions 
reduction 
estimates 
to 2030 
have 
been evaluated 
based 
on improvements 
that 
can reasonably 
be 
 expected using 
technologies 
currently available. 
Detailed 
analysis to 
determine 
economic 
viability of 
available 
 technologies has not been considered. 
 The target reduction of 30 by 2030 
is based in the current mine plans for Coronado's 
Curragh and U.S. mines 
 and 
is 
not 
expected 
to 
be 
a 
linear 
reduction. 
As 
we 
address 
our 
material 
areas 
of 
impact 
including 
emission 
 reductions and opportunities, the need for mitigation technologies 
are likely to increase. 
 We are 
also evaluating 
a range 
of potential 
projects that 
could have 
a positive 
impact on 
our emissions 
profile 
 including options for 
energy generation from 
solar, 
wind and gas 
along with on-grid 
solutions. For example, 
we 
 began a project to understand and define gas reservoirs at Curragh with gas production drilling that commenced 
 in 
the 
fourth 
quarter 
of 
2022. 
This 
project 
will 
continue 
into 
2023 
with 
well 
completion 
and 
an 
anticipated 
 downstream trial of running gas converted haul trucks using the incidental coal seam gas from our operations as 
 a diesel substitute. 

 Similarly, on July 27, 
2022, we 
officially commissioned the 
Buchanan Ventilation Air Methane, 
or VAM, abatement 
 project 
on 
vent 
shaft 
16 
at 
our 
U.S. 
Operations. 
The 
project 
utilizes 
the 
latest 
technology 
to 
convert 
fugitive 
 methane 
gas 
emissions 
to 
carbon 
dioxide. 
The 
goal 
of 
this 
project 
is 
to 
reduce 
the 
Buchanan 
mine 
methane 
 emissions 
by 
approximately 
22 
times 
and 
reduce 
total 
emissions 
from 
the 
mine 
by 
61 
by 
2030. 
The 
initial 
 performance 
from 
the 
VAM 
unit 
is 
encouraging 
with 
the 
project 
achieving 
94 
emission 
reduction 
efficiency. 
 While Coronado 
is also 
exploring other 
projects to 
reduce its 
carbon footprint, 
if the 
VAM projections are achieved, 
 it may alone result in the Company meeting their target 
reduction by 2030. 
 Increased public concern may result in 
additional regulatory risks as new laws and 
regulations aimed at reducing 
 GHG emissions come into effect in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG 
 emissions could adversely impact our growth, increase our operating 
costs, or reduce demand for our coal. 

 With 
respect 
to 
physical 
climate 
risks, 
our 
operations 
may 
be 
impacted 
by 
weather-related 
events 
potentially 
 resulting in lost production, supply chain disruptions and increased 
operating costs, which could have a material 
 adverse impact on our financial results of operations. 

 Increasingly, both foreign and domestic banks, insurance companies and large investors are curtailing or ending 
 their financial 
relationships with 
fossil fuel-related 
companies. This 
has or 
is likely 
to continue 
to have 
adverse 
 impacts on the liquidity and operations of coal producers. 
 Additionally, federal, 
state and international GHG and climate 
change initiatives, associated regulations or 
other 
 voluntary commitments 
to reduce 
GHG emissions 
could significantly 
increase the 
cost of 
coal 
production 
and 
 consumption, increase costs as 
a result of 
regulations requiring the installation 
of emissions control technologies, 
 increase expenses associated with 
the purchase of emissions reduction 
credits to comply with future 
emissions 
 trading 
programs, 
or 
significantly 
reduce 
coal 
consumption 
through 
implementation 
of 
a 
future 
clean 
energy 
 standard. Such 
initiatives and 
regulations could 
further reduce 
demand or 
prices for 
our coal 
in both 
domestic 
 and international markets, 
could adversely affect 
our ability to 
produce coal and 
to develop our 
reserves, could 
 reduce the value 
of our coal 
and coal reserves, and 
may have a 
material adverse effect on 
our business, financial 
 condition and results of operations. 
 On November 20, 2022, 
the Sharm el-Sheik 
Conference of Parties 27, 
or COP27, maintained 
language around 
 fossil fuels from 
Glasgow Conference of Parties 
26, which called 
on governments to accelerate 
the dissemination 
 of technologies, 
and 
the adoption 
of 
policies, to 
transition 
toward 
a low-emission 
energy system, 
including 
by 
 accelerating the 
phasedown of 
unabated coal 
power, 
that is 
coal power 
that does 
not include 
the capture 
and 
 storage of carbon dioxide emission and phase-out inefficient 
fossil fuel subsidies.

 Human Capital Disclosures 
 Our ability to 
attract and 
retain skilled, 
motivated and 
engaged employees 
is an 
essential part 
of our 
business. 
 Investing in the skill and capabilities of our people will underwrite our 
long-term growth and sustainability. In both 
 Australia 
and 
United 
States, 
we 
operate 
in 
regional 
locations 
with 
highly 
competitive 
labor 
markets. 
In 
each 
 location, 
we 
are 
creating 
a 
high-performing 
workforce 
with 
a 
talent 
pipeline 
for 
future 
leaders, 
including 
 succession planning for critical roles. To 
achieve this, we continue to create a 
culture that welcomes and values 
 all people and 
where our core 
values of collaboration, 
accountability, 
respect and excellence 
are demonstrated 
 in everything that we do. 
 In 2022, a number of initiatives were undertaken to enhance our culture, increase 
our ability to attract and retain 
 the workforce we 
need, and to 
continue to drive 
our desire to 
build safe, high-performing 
teams. This has 
included 
 extensive efforts to gather feedback from our 
employees and contracting partners through surveys, focus groups 
 and 
team 
empowerment 
sessions. 
Following 
analysis 
of 
the 
feedback, 
priorities 
were 
identified, 
and 
cultural 
 programs designed to 
bridge gaps between 
current and desired 
cultural states were 
developed and implemented. 

 Worldwide we had 1,735
 employees as of December 31, 2022. 
In addition, as of December 31, 
2022, there were 
 2,326 contractors supplementing the permanent workforce, 
primarily at Curragh. 
 As of 
December 31, 
2022, approximately 
11.5 
of our 
total employees, 
all at 
our Australian 
Operations, were 
 covered by a single, federally-certified collective Enterprise Agreement, or the EA, for specified groups 
of mining 
 and maintenance 
employees. 
In May 
2019, the 
Australian Fair 
Work Commission 
approved the 
Curragh Mine 
 Enterprise Agreement 2019. This EA has 
a nominal expiration date of May 26, 
2022 and will remain in 
place until 
 replaced 
or 
terminated 
by 
the 
Fair 
Work 
Commission. 
We 
have 
been 
negotiating 
with 
employee 
bargaining 
 representatives for a replacement EA 
since March 2022. Those negotiations 
continue in good faith 
with the intent 
 of reaching an agreement as soon as practicable. Our U.S. Operations 
employ a 100 non-union labor force. 
 Safety 
 Our 
employees 
and 
contractors 
are 
our 
most 
valuable 
assets 
and 
we 
consider 
their 
safety 
our 
number 
one 
 priority. 
Safety is 
essential to 
all business 
functions and 
is never 
to be 
compromised, under 
any circumstance. 
 The 
health 
and 
safety 
of 
our 
people 
is 
reinforced 
every 
day 
through 
our 
culture, 
behaviors, 
training, 
 communication and procedures. 

 We manage safety and health 
through continuous improvement efforts 
and the implementation of practices 
and 
 procedures that 
address safety risks 
in full 
compliance with 
the legal 
and regulatory frameworks 
of both 
the United 
 States and Australia. 
We empower our 
people to consistently 
strive to have 
a safety mindset, 
and act by 
applying, 
 managing and monitoring 
effective controls 
to prevent 
adverse outcomes with 
all activities and 
operations. Our 
 programs 
are 
intended 
to 
reinforce 
our 
position 
that 
safety 
and 
health 
should 
always 
be 
front 
of 
mind 
for 
all 
 employees and contractors. 

 Safety 
performance 
is 
monitored 
through 
physical 
observations 
from 
both 
internal 
and 
external 
parties 
and 
 through the 
reporting of 
key metrics. 
Safety performance 
is assessed 
monthly against 
internal goals 
and on 
a 
 quarterly basis is benchmarked against our peers within the 
mining industry. 

 We set targets 
for safety interactions 
which is a process 
where employees observe 
a risk behavior and 
provide 
 immediate feedback 
if it 
is deemed, 
or has the 
potential to 
be, unsafe. 
This is 
monitored by 
management daily 
 through safety meetings, 
site visits, employee 
discussions, and management 
observations. The process 
allows 
 for greater empowerment, innovation and employee input 
into the mining process. 

 The 12-month 
rolling average 
Total 
Reportable Injury 
Frequency Rate TRIFR as 
of December 
31, 2022 
for 
 our Australian Operations was 3.92 and 
the Total Reportable Incident Rate TRIR for 12-month rolling average 
 as of 
December 
31, 2022 
for our 
U.S. Operations 
was 
2.42. As 
indicated 
in the 
graphs below, 
our Australian 
 Operations 
outperformed 
the 
Queensland 
industry 
average 
in 
2021 
and 
2022 
and 
our 
U.S. 
Operations 
 outperformed the U.S. national average in 
2021 and 2022. We strive to 
ensure that we continue to 
provide a safe 
 operating environment for all employees and contractors.

 Workforce composition and diversity 
 Our 
values 
(CARE 
 
Collaboration, 
Accountability, 
Respect, 
Excellence) 
guide 
our 
policies, 
processes 
and 
 actions as they 
relate to 
all workforce 
interactions and 
people related 
initiatives. As 
part of these 
values and 
to 
 enable our people to excel within the workplace we are building a diverse and inclusive workforce, where unique 
 viewpoints are 
heard, valued 
and respected. 
We believe 
this directly 
impacts the 
safety and 
productivity of 
our 
 people. Our employees are trained to recognize and mitigate 
potential biases towards others. 
 We 
invest 
in 
training 
and 
development 
programs 
for 
both 
our 
new 
and 
long-serving 
employees. 
Investing 
in 
 graduate 
recruitment, 
traineeships 
and 
internship 
programs 
through 
partnerships 
with 
leading 
education 
 institutions 
has 
been 
central 
to 
accessing 
talent 
and 
building 
our 
brand. 
Further, 
our 
internal 
leadership 
 development enhances succession planning and the transfer 
of skills and knowledge across our business. 
 As at December 31, 2022: 
 
in the United States, just over 6 of Senior Managers 
were female. 
 
in Australia, almost 30 
of employees at a General 
Manager, Senior 
Manager and Senior Professional 
 level were female, an increase of approximately 2 from December 
31, 2021. 
 
7 of our global workforce was female. 
 
58.8 of all employees were between the ages of 30 and 50 
years old. 
 Attracting and retaining the right people 
 We continued 
to focus our 
efforts on 
recruiting trainees 
and other entry 
level roles. We 
have also implemented 
 the following initiatives: 

Comprehensive training, performance and leadership development 
programs. 
 
Competitive and flexible remuneration structure. 
 In 
2022, 
our 
total 
rolling 
turnover 
rate 
was 
16.0 
and 
16.7 
in 
Australia 
and 
the 
U.S., 
respectively, 
and 
our 
 voluntary 
departure 
rolling 
turnover 
rate 
was 
14.5 
in 
both 
Australia 
and 
the 
U.S. 
In 
2021, 
our 
total 
rolling 
 turnover rate was 27.9 
and 18.4 and 
our voluntary departure 
rolling turnover rate 
was 17.3 and 
15.4 , in 
 Australia and the U.S., respectively. 

 Regulatory Matters Australia 
 Our Australian Operations 
are regulated by the 
laws and regulations 
of the Commonwealth 
of Australia, or 
Cth, 
 the State 
of Queensland, 
or Qld, 
and local 
jurisdictions. Most 
environmental laws 
are promulgated 
at the 
state 
 level, but the Australian federal government has a 
role in approval of actions which have national 
environmental

23 
 significance. 
In 
Queensland, 
the 
environmental 
laws 
relevant 
to 
coal 
mining 
include 
development 
legislation, 
 pollution, 
waste, 
ecosystem 
protection, 
cultural 
heritage 
and 
native 
title 
land 
contamination 
and 
rehabilitation 
 legislation. In addition, the Australian federal government regulates 
foreign investment and export approvals. 
 Tenements 
 We control the 
coal mining 
rights at Curragh 
under 14 coal 
and infrastructure 
mining leases, or 
MLs, and three 
 mineral development licenses, or MDLs, granted pursuant to the Mineral Resources Act 1989 (Qld). 
See Item 2. 
 Properties for more information regarding the Tenements. 
 Mineral Resources Act 1989 (Qld) 
 The Mineral Resources 
Act 1989 (Qld) 
and the Mineral 
and Energy Resources 
(Common Provisions) 
Act 2014 
 (Qld), together, 
provide for the 
assessment, development 
and utilization of 
mineral resources in 
Queensland to 
 the 
maximum 
extent 
practicable, 
consistent 
with 
sound 
economic 
and 
land 
use 
management. 
The 
Mineral 
 Resources 
Act 
1989 
(Qld) 
vests 
ownership 
of 
minerals, 
with 
limited 
exceptions, 
in 
the 
Crown 
(i.e., the 
state 
 government). A royalty is payable to the Crown for 
the right to extract minerals. The Mineral Resources Act 1989 
 (Qld) creates different tenures 
for different mining activities, 
such as prospecting, exploring 
and mining. A ML is 
 the most important 
tenure, as it permits 
the extraction of 
minerals in conjunction 
with other required 
authorities. 
 The Mineral Resources Act 1989 (Qld) imposes general conditions 
on a ML. 
 A person who is the holder 
of a ML must keep 
the records necessary to enable the royalty payable 
by the person 
 to 
be 
ascertained. 
In 
2022, 
the 
Queensland 
State 
Government 
in 
Australia 
amended 
the 
Mineral 
Resources 
 Regulation 
2013 
(Qld) 
introducing 
additional 
higher 
tiers 
to 
the 
coal 
royalty 
rates 
effective 
from 
July 
1, 
2022, 
 increasing the royalty payable by our Australian Operations. 
 The new tiers applicable in calculating the royalty payable for our Australian Operations from July 1, 2022 are as 
 set out below: 
 
7 for average coal price per Mt sold up to and including 
A 100 per Mt; 
 
12.5 for average coal price per Mt sold from A 100 to 
A 150 per Mt; 
 
15 for average coal price per Mt sold from A 150 to 
A 175 per Mt; 
 
20 for average coal price per Mt sold from A 175 to 
A 225 per Mt; 
 
30 for average coal price per Mt sold from A 225 to 
A 300 per Mt; and 
 
 40 for average coal price per Mt sold above A 300 per 
Mt.
 The royalty 
payable 
for 
coal sold, 
disposed 
of or 
used 
in 
a return 
period 
is then 
calculated 
by multiplying 
the 
 royalty rate by the 
value of the coal. 
Queensland Revenue 
Office Royalty 
Ruling MRA001.1 contains 
details on 
 the 
costs 
that 
can 
(and 
cannot) 
be 
deducted 
when 
calculating 
the 
applicable 
royalty 
and 
the 
method 
for 
 determining the value of the coal. Where there is a change in legislation 
or case law that affects the content of a 
 royalty ruling, the change 
in the law 
overrides the royalty ruling i.e., the 
Commissioner will determine the royalty 
 liability in 
accordance with 
the changed 
law. 
See Item 2. 
 Properties for 
a discussion 
of the 
royalties currently 
 applicable to Curragh. 
 Mining Rehabilitation (Reclamation) 
 Mine closure and rehabilitation risks and costs are regulated 
by Queensland state legislation. 
 Amongst 
other 
things, 
an 
Environmental 
Authority 
Holder, 
or 
EA 
Holder, 
must 
provide 
the 
Queensland 
State 
 Government with financial assurance for the purpose of drawing upon in the event that an EA Holder defaults on 
 its obligations to rehabilitate the mine site. 
 The Mineral 
and 
Energy 
Resources 
(Financial 
Provisioning) 
Act 
2018 (Qld), 
or the 
Financial 
Provisioning 
Act 
 establishes 
a 
financial 
provisioning 
scheme, 
or 
the 
Scheme, 
from 
which 
the 
Department 
of 
Environment 
and 
 Science, or the DES, sources funds to rehabilitate and 
remediate land subject to mining. 

Table of Contents 
 Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 
2022 
24 
 Under the Financial Provisioning Act, 
all mine operators are required 
to make a submission 
to the DES in 
respect 
 of an Estimated Rehabilitation Cost, or ERC, 
for the mine site. The ERC is determined 
using the DES-approved 
 ERC calculator. 
Using this 
information, the 
DES sets 
the ERC 
for the 
mine. The 
DES provides 
the ERC 
to the 
 manager of the 
Scheme, or 
the Scheme Manager. 
The Scheme 
Manager undertakes 
a risk assessment 
of the 
 mine, 
which 
is 
based 
upon 
independent 
advice 
from 
a 
Scheme 
risk 
advisor. 
It 
includes 
detail 
on 
the 
mine 
 operator s financial 
soundness and credit 
rating, characteristics of 
the mining operation 
(e.g., life of mine, 
or LOM, 
 and off-take agreements), 
rehabilitation history, 
environmental compliance 
history and the 
submission made by 
 the Company. 
Risk categories include 
high, moderate, low 
and very low. 
If the ERC 
and risk categories 
are set 
 at moderate, 
low or 
very low 
for a 
mine, then 
there is 
a need 
to pay 
an annual 
contribution 
based on 
a small 
 percentage of the ERC to the Scheme. If the category is high, then the operation provides a surety for the whole 
 ERC and possibly a contribution 
to the Scheme. The risk 
assessment of the mine and, 
therefore, the amount of 
 the contribution to 
the fund is assessed 
and paid annually 
in perpetuity, or until a 
clearance certificate is obtained. 

 Each year, the Scheme Manager 
is required to 
make an Annual 
Review Allocation to determine 
whether the mine 
 will provide surety or pay a contribution to the Scheme 
depending on the value of the ERC relating to applicable 
 environmental authorities, as follows: 
 1) 
ERC A 450 million - pay a cash contribution into the 
Scheme and provide bank guarantees. 
 Curragh 
has 
2 
environmental 
authorities, 
or 
EAs, 
which 
are 
covered 
by 
the 
Scheme, 
namely 
EA 
number 
 EPML00643713 
and 
EA 
number 
EPVX00635313. 
In 
October 
2022, 
the 
Scheme 
Manager 
completed 
the 
 assessment of the Annual Review Allocation for environmental authority number EPML00643713 
and issued an 
 Annual 
Review 
Allocation 
of 
 Moderate . 
The 
moderate 
rating 
resulted 
in 
Curragh 
being 
obliged 
to 
make 
a 
 financial contribution to the Scheme of 2.75 of the ERC. 
In January 2023, the Scheme Manager completed an 
 assessment of the Annual Review 
Allocation for Environmental Authority Number EPVX00635313 and issued 
an 
 Annual 
Review 
Allocation 
of High 
in 
respect 
of 
MDL162 
requiring 
Curragh 
to 
maintain 
its historical 
financial 
 assurance in respect of 100 of the ERC for Environmental 
Authority Number EPVX00635313.
 The Financial Provisioning Act also requires 
for a Progressive Rehabilitation and 
Closure Plan, or a PRCP, 
with 
 respect 
to 
mined 
land. 
This 
requirement 
will 
be 
integrated 
into 
the 
existing 
EA 
processes 
for 
new 
mines, 
 minimizing the 
regulatory burden 
on government 
and industry. 
All mining 
projects carried 
out under 
a ML 
that 
 make a site-specific 
EA application will 
be required to 
provide a PRCP. If approved by 
the administering authority, 
 a stand-alone PRCP 
schedule will be 
given to the 
applicant together with 
the EA. The 
PRCP schedule will 
contain 
 milestones 
with 
completion 
dates 
for 
achieving 
progressive 
rehabilitation 
of 
the 
mine 
site. 
The 
Financial 
 Provisioning Act provided 
transitional arrangements for three years 
for the application of the PRCP 
requirement 
 to 
existing 
mines. 
The 
requirement 
for 
a 
PRCP 
commenced 
on 
November 
1, 
2019, 
or 
the 
PRCP 
start 
date, 
 however all existing mining operations only transition into the PRCP framework once a transition notice 
is issued 
 by the relevant government department. Curragh was issued with a 
transition notice with respect to its PRCP. Its 
 application 
for 
a 
proposed 
PRCP 
was 
received 
by 
the 
administering 
authority 
on 
October 
20, 
2022.
 The 
 administering 
authority 
has 
requested 
the 
Company 
provide 
further 
information 
to 
assess 
the 
application 
by 
 August 28, 2023. 
 Environmental Protection Act 1994 (Qld) 
 The 
primary 
legislation 
regulating 
environmental 
management 
of 
mining 
activities 
in 
Queensland 
is 
the 
 Environmental 
Protection 
Act 1994 
(Qld), 
or 
the 
EP 
Act. Its 
objective 
is to 
protect 
Queensland s 
environment 
 while allowing 
for development 
that improves 
the total 
quality of 
life, both 
now and 
in the 
future, in 
a way 
that 
 maintains ecologically sustainable 
development. Under the EP 
Act, it is an offense 
to carry out a 
mining activity 
 unless the person holds or is acting under an EA for the activity. The EA imposes conditions on a project. It is an 
 offense to contravene a condition of an 
EA. In addition to the requirements found 
in the conditions of an EA, the 
 holder must 
also meet 
its general 
environmental 
duty and 
duty to 
notify of 
environmental 
harm and 
otherwise 
 comply with the provisions of the 
EP Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. For example, the following 
 are offenses under the EP Act: 
 
causing serious or material environmental harm; 
 
causing environmental nuisance;

depositing proscribed water contaminants in waters and related 
matters; and 
 
placing contaminants where environmental harm or nuisance 
may be caused. 
 The 
EA 
holder 
must 
also 
be 
a 
registered 
suitable 
operator 
under 
the 
EP 
Act. 
We 
are 
a 
registered 
suitable 
 operator. 
 We hold 
EA EPML00643713, which 
authorizes the 
mining of black 
coal, mineral 
processing, chemical storage, 
 waste disposal and 
sewage treatment over 
the 14 MLs 
at Curragh on 
certain conditions. Those 
conditions include 
 requirements 
in relation 
to 
air and 
water quality, 
regulated structures 
(e.g., dams), 
noise and 
vibration, waste, 
 land use, rehabilitation and watercourse diversion. 
 We 
also 
hold 
a 
range 
of 
subsidiary 
EAs 
for 
our 
Australian 
Operations. 
See 
 Mining 
Rehabilitation 
 (Reclamation)
 
 above
 for more information regarding the Financial Provisioning 
Act. 

 Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2003 (Qld) 
 The Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2003 (Qld) imposes a duty of care on all persons to take all reasonable and 
 practicable measures to ensure that any activity conducted does not harm 
Aboriginal cultural heritage. Its object 
 is to provide effective recognition, protection and conservation 
of Aboriginal cultural heritage. 
 We have obligations 
relating to Aboriginal cultural 
heritage with respect 
to a number of 
cultural heritage objects 
 and areas located within 
the area of the 
Tenements. 
We work closely 
with the Aboriginal people 
to manage the 
 cultural heritage objects, areas or 
evidence of archaeological significance, within 
our mining operations. We 
are 
 party to a Cultural Heritage Management Plan (and associated Cultural 
Services Agreement) with the Gaangalu 
 Nation People that applies 
to all of the Tenements. 
The plan establishes a 
coordinating committee and sets 
out 
 the steps to be followed to manage activities that may impact 
Aboriginal cultural heritage. 
 Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) 
 The Native Title Act 
1993 (Cth), or NTA, 
sets out procedures under which 
native title claims may be lodged 
and 
 determined and compensation claimed for 
the extinguishment or impairment of 
the native title rights or interests 
 of Aboriginal peoples. Its object is to provide for the recognition and protection of native title, to establish ways in 
 which future 
dealings affecting 
native title 
may proceed 
and to 
set standards 
for those 
dealings, to 
establish a 
 mechanism 
for determining 
claims to 
native 
title 
and to 
provide for, 
or permit, 
the 
validation of 
past 
acts, 
and 
 intermediate period acts, invalidated because of the existence 
of native title. 
 With respect to MLs and MDLs 
granted under the Mineral Resources 
Act 1989 (Qld) on state land 
where native 
 title has not 
been extinguished, 
a principle 
known as 
the non-extinguishment 
principle governs. 
Broadly, 
under 
 this principle, native title rights are suspended while the mining tenure, 
as renewed from time to time, is in force. 
 The grant 
(or renewal) 
of a 
mining tenure 
in respect 
of land 
where native 
title may 
exist must 
comply with 
the 
 NTA 
to ensure 
the validity 
of the tenure. 
Registered native 
title claimants 
have certain 
notification, consultation 
 and negotiation rights relating 
to mining tenures. Where 
native title is extinguished 
(i.e., freehold land), the NTA 
 does not apply. 
 Regional Planning Interests 
 The Regional 
Planning Interests 
Act 2014 
(Qld), or 
the RPI 
Act manages 
the impact 
of resource 
activities and 
 other 
regulated 
activities 
in 
areas 
of 
the 
state 
that 
contribute, 
or 
are 
likely 
to 
contribute, 
to 
Queensland s 
 economic, social 
and environmental 
prosperity (e.g., competing 
land use 
activities on 
prime farming 
land). The 
 RPI 
Act 
identifies 
areas 
of 
Queensland 
that 
are 
of 
regional 
interest, 
including 
strategic 
cropping 
areas 
and 
 strategic environmental 
areas. Under the 
RPI Act, 
conducting a resource 
activity in an 
area of regional 
interest 
 requires 
a 
regional 
interest 
development 
approval, 
unless 
operating 
under 
an 
exemption. 
Importantly, 
 pre-existing mining activities being undertaken at the date of 
the introduction of the legislation are exempt. 
 We 
have 
been 
granted 
a 
regional 
interest 
development 
approval 
for 
the 
 Curragh 
Expansion 
Project 
(for 
 ML700006, 
ML 
700007 
and 
ML700008), 
which 
is 
subject 
to 
regional 
interest 
conditions, 
such 
as 
mitigation. 
 Certain protection conditions 
are also imposed 
on us with respect 
to ML 80171, 
which includes an 
obligation to 
 provide mitigation in the event that strategic cropping land 
is impacted by future operations.

 Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation 
Act 1999 (Cth) 
 The Environment Protection 
and Biodiversity Conservation 
Act 1999 (Cth), 
or the EPBC Act, 
provides a federal 
 framework 
to 
protect 
and 
manage 
matters 
of 
national 
environmental 
significance, 
such 
as 
listed 
threatened 
 species 
and 
ecological 
communities 
and 
water 
resources. 
In 
addition, 
the 
EPBC 
Act 
confers 
jurisdiction 
over 
 actions 
that 
have 
a 
significant 
impact 
on 
the 
environment 
where 
the 
actions 
affect, 
or 
are 
taken 
on, 
 Commonwealth land, or are carried out by a Commonwealth agency. 
 Under the 
EPBC Act, controlled 
actions that have 
or are likely 
to have a 
significant impact on 
a matter 
of national 
 environmental significance are subject 
to a rigorous assessment 
and approval process. A 
person must not take 
 a controlled 
action unless approval 
is granted 
under the 
EPBC Act. 
Any person 
proposing to 
carry out 
an action 
 that may be 
a controlled action 
must refer the 
matter to the 
Commonwealth Minister 
for a determination 
as to 
 whether the proposed action is a controlled action. 
 On 
November 2, 
2016, 
the 
Commonwealth 
Minister 
for 
the 
Department 
of 
the 
Environment 
and 
Energy 
 administering the 
EPBC Act 
approved the 
extension of 
the existing Curragh 
mining area to 
include mining 
four 
 additional Tenements 
 ML 700006, 
ML 700007, 
ML 700008 
and ML 700009 
(EPBC Act 
referral 2015/7508) 
 as 
a 
 controlled 
action, 
on 
certain 
conditions. 
The 
conditions 
include 
requirements 
in 
relation 
to 
offsets 
and 
 groundwater. 
 Mine Health and Safety 
 The primary health and safety legislation that applies 
to Curragh are the Coal Mining Safety and 
Health Act 1999 
 (Qld) 
and 
the 
Coal 
Mining 
Safety 
and 
Health 
Regulation 2001 
(Qld), 
which 
we 
refer 
to, 
together, 
as the 
Coal 
 Mining Safety Legislation. 
 Additional 
legislative 
requirements 
apply 
to 
operations 
that 
are 
carried 
on 
off-site 
or 
which 
are 
not 
principally 
 related to 
coal mining 
(e.g., transport, rail 
operations, etc.). 
The Coal 
Mining Safety 
Legislation imposes 
safety 
 and health 
obligations on 
persons who 
operate coal 
mines or 
who may 
affect 
the safety 
or health 
of others 
at 
 coal mines. Under the Coal Mining Safety Legislation, the operator 
of a coal mine must, among other things: 
 
ensure that the risk to coal mine workers while at the 
operator s mine is at an acceptable level; 
 
audit and review the 
effectiveness and 
implementation of the 
safety and health 
management system to 
 ensure the risk to persons is at an acceptable level; 
 
provide 
adequate 
resources 
to 
ensure 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
safety 
and 
health 
 management system; 
 
ensure the 
operator s own 
safety and 
health and 
the safety 
and health 
of others 
is not 
affected by 
the 
 way the operator conducts coal mining operations; 
 
not carry 
out an 
activity at 
the coal 
mine that 
creates a 
risk to 
a person 
on an 
adjacent or 
overlapping 
 petroleum authority if the risk is higher than an acceptable 
level of risk; 
 
appoint a site senior executive for the mine; 
 
ensure the site senior 
executive develops and 
implements a safety 
and health management 
system for 
 all people at the mine; 
 
ensure the 
site senior 
executive develops, 
implements 
and maintains 
a management 
structure for 
the 
 mine that helps ensure the safety and health of persons 
at the mine; and 
 
not operate the coal mine without a safety and health 
management system for the mine. 
 We recognize that health and 
safety are imperative to the ongoing 
success of our Australian Operations. 
As the 
 operator at Curragh, we have 
in place a comprehensive safety 
and health management system, 
which includes 
 an emergency 
response 
team, 
to address 
these legislative 
requirements. 
In accordance 
with the 
Coal Mining 
 Safety Legislation we have also established an occupational 
hygiene baseline for dust exposure at Curragh.

 Water Act 2000 (Qld) 

 In Queensland, all entitlements to the use, control and 
flow of water are vested in the state and regulated by 
the 
 Water Act 
2000 (Qld). 
Allocations under 
the Water 
Act 2000 (Qld) 
can be managed 
by a water 
supply scheme 
 operator, 
such 
as 
SunWater Ltd, 
which 
is 
a 
Government-owned 
corporation 
regulated 
by 
the 
Queensland 
 Competition Authority. We 
have purchased the required water allocations for Curragh and entered into a suite of 
 related 
channel 
and 
pipeline 
infrastructure 
agreements 
and 
river 
supply 
agreements 
with 
SunWater Ltd 
to 
 regulate the 
supply of water 
pursuant to these 
allocations. See Item 1A. 
 Risk Factors In times 
of drought and/or 
 shortage of available water, our operations and production, particularly at Curragh, could be negatively impacted 
 if the regulators impose restrictions on our water offtake 
licenses that are required for water used in the CPPs. 
 National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 
(Cth) 
 The National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (Cth) imposes requirements for both foreign and local 
 corporations whose carbon dioxide production, greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions and/or energy consumption 
 meets 
a 
certain 
threshold 
to 
register 
and 
report 
GHG 
emissions 
and 
abatement 
actions, 
as 
well 
as 
energy 
 production 
and 
consumption 
as 
part 
of 
a 
single, 
national 
reporting 
system. 
The 
Clean 
Energy 
Regulator 
 administers 
the 
National 
Greenhouse 
and 
Energy 
Reporting 
Act 
2007 
(Cth), 
and 
the 
Department 
of 
Climate 
 Change, Energy, the 
Environment and Water is responsible 
for related policy developments and review. 
 In accordance with Safeguard Mechanism under this 
legislation, Curragh has been a assigned 
a baseline for its 
 covered emissions 
(Scope 
1) and 
we must 
take steps 
to keep 
our emissions 
at or 
below the 
baseline or 
face 
 penalties. 
The 
Australian 
federal 
government 
is 
currently 
reviewing 
the 
Safeguard 
Mechanism 
and 
proposed 
 reforms are under public consultation. 
 Labor Relations 
 Minimum employment entitlements, embodied in the National Employment Standards, apply to all private-sector 
 employees 
and 
employers 
in Australia 
under 
the federal 
Fair Work 
Act 2009 
(Cth). 
These standards 
regulate 
 employment conditions and paid leave. Employees who are associated with the 
day-to-day operations of a local 
 mine or mines and who are not located in head office or corporate administration offices are also covered by the 
 Black Coal Mining Industry Award 2010 which regulates conditions including termination arrangements; pay and 
 hours of work. 
 Unfair dismissal, 
enterprise bargaining, 
bullying claims, 
industrial actions 
and resolution 
of workplace 
disputes 
 are also regulated 
under state 
and federal 
legislation. Some 
of the workers 
at Curragh 
are covered 
by the 
EA, 
 which 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
Fair 
Work 
Commission, 
Australia s 
national 
workplace 
relations 
tribunal. 
See 
 
 Human Capital Disclosures above. 
 Regulatory Matters United States 
 Federal, 
state 
and 
local 
authorities 
regulate 
the 
U.S. 
coal 
mining 
industry 
with 
respect 
to 
matters 
such 
as 
 employee 
health 
and 
safety, 
protection 
of 
the 
environment, 
permitting 
and 
licensing 
requirements, 
air 
quality 
 standards, water pollution, plant and wildlife protection, the 
reclamation and restoration of mining properties after 
 mining 
has 
been 
completed, 
the 
discharge 
of 
materials 
into 
the 
environment, 
surface 
subsidence 
from 
 underground mining and the effects 
of mining on groundwater quality 
and availability. 
In addition, the industry is 
 affected 
by significant 
requirements 
mandating 
certain 
benefits for 
current 
and 
retired 
coal miners. 
Numerous 
 federal, 
state 
and 
local 
governmental 
permits 
and 
approvals 
are 
required 
for 
mining 
operations. 
Because 
of 
 extensive and 
comprehensive 
regulatory 
requirements, 
violations during 
mining 
operations 
occur from 
time 
to 
 time in the industry. 
The summary below is a 
non-exhaustive summary of material 
legislation that applies to our 
 U.S. Operations. Although 
this summary 
focuses on federal 
laws, most states 
(including Virginia, 
West Virginia 
 and Pennsylvania) have 
their own regulatory 
schemes that either 
mirror federal laws 
or create additional 
layers 
 of regulation. 
 Clean Air Act of 1970 
 The U.S. 
Clean Air 
Act of 
1970, or 
the CAA, 
regulates airborne 
pollution that 
may be 
potentially detrimental 
to 
 human 
health, 
the 
environment 
or 
natural 
resources. 
The 
CAA 
and 
comparable 
state 
laws 
that 
govern 
air 
 emissions affect U.S. coal mining operations bo 
th directly and indirectly. 

Table of Contents 
 Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 
2022 
28 
 Direct impacts 
on coal 
mining and 
processing operations 
may occur 
through the 
CAA permitting 
requirements 
 and/or 
emission 
control 
requirements 
relating 
to 
particulate 
matter, 
or 
PM, 
nitrogen 
dioxide, 
ozone 
and 
sulfur 
 dioxide, 
or 
SO
 2
 . 
For 
example, 
the 
U.S. 
Environmental 
Protection 
Agency, 
or 
the 
EPA, 
pursuant 
to 
the 
CAA, 
 administers 
rules 
that 
apply 
PM 
emissions 
limits 
to 
emissions 
from 
coal 
preparation 
and 
processing 
plants 
 constructed or 
modified after 
April 28, 2008. 
In addition, 
in recent 
years, the 
EPA 
has adopted 
more stringent 
 national ambient air quality standards, or 
NAAQS for PM, nitrogen oxide, ozone 
and SO
 2
 . It is possible 
that these 
 modifications as well 
as future modifications 
to NAAQS could 
directly or indirectly 
impact our mining operations 
 in 
a 
manner 
that 
includes, 
but 
is 
not 
limited 
to, 
the 
EPA 
designating 
new 
areas 
of 
the 
country 
as 
being 
in 
 nonattainment of applicable 
NAAQS or expanding 
existing nonattainment 
areas, and prompting 
additional local 
 control measures 
pursuant 
to state 
implementation 
plans, or 
SIPs, required 
to address 
such revised 
NAAQS. 
 SIPs may be 
state-specific or 
regional in scope. 
Under the CAA, 
individual states 
have up to 12 
years from the 
 date of designation of attainment/nonattainment areas 
to secure reductions from emission sources. 

 The CAA 
also indirectly, but significantly, affects the 
U.S. coal 
industry by 
extensively regulating the 
SO2, nitrogen 
 oxides, mercury, 
PM, greenhouse gases, 
and other substances 
emitted by coal-burning 
facilities, such as 
steel 
 manufacturers, 
coke 
ovens 
and 
coal 
fired 
electric 
power 
generating 
facilities. 
Over 
time, 
the 
EPA 
has 
 promulgated or proposed CAA 
regulations to impose more 
stringent air emission standards 
for a number 
of these 
 coal-burning industries, especially the power 
generation sector. 
While the EPA 
under the Trump Administration 
 moved toward repealing or loosening 
some of those regulations, the Biden 
Administration has moved to restore 
 some regulations, such as those governing mercury emissions . This is particularly 
the case for greenhouse gas 
 emissions from coal-fired electric generating facilities, 
as President Biden has called for bringing the U.S. 
power 
 sector to zero 
greenhouse gas emissions 
by 2035. However, 
in 2022, the United 
States Supreme Court 
limited 
 the 
ability 
of 
EPA 
to 
regulate 
air 
emissions 
through 
 beyond 
the 
fence 
line 
regulations. 
Collectively, 
CAA 
 regulations and uncertainty 
around future CAA 
requirements could reduce 
the demand for coal 
and, depending 
 on the 
extent of 
such reduction, 
could have 
a material 
adverse effect 
on our 
business, financial 
condition and 
 operations. 
 NAAQS Revisions
 . 
The CAA 
requires the 
EPA 
to periodically 
review and, 
if appropriate, 
revise the 
NAAQS to 
 ensure protection of 
public health. 
In recent years, 
the EPA 
has reviewed the 
NAAQS for PM, 
ozone and SO
 2
 . 

 The PM NAAQS 
was last revised 
and made more 
stringent in 2012. 
Individual states have developed 
SIPs, which 
 detail the PM emission reductions their sources must meet in order for 
the state to maintain or achieve the 2012 
 PM NAAQS. On 
April 14, 
2020, the EPA announced 
its intention 
to retain, without 
changes, the 2012 
PM NAAQS. 

 This 
action 
was 
finalized 
by 
EPA 
on 
December 
18, 
2020. 
On 
June 
10, 
2021, 
EPA 
announced 
that 
it 
would 
 reconsider this decision in light 
of scientific evidence pointing 
to health issues caused 
by exposure to PM. 
EPA 
 expects to issue a proposed rule with more stringent standards for PM in 
Summer 2022 and a final rule in Spring 
 2023. 
 In 
2015, 
the 
EPA 
issued 
a 
final 
rule 
reducing 
the 
primary 
ozone 
NAAQS 
from 
75 
to 
70 
parts 
per 
billion 
but 
 retaining the existing secondary ozone 
NAAQS. States with moderate or 
high nonattainment areas must submit 
 SIPs for 
the 
2015 
ozone 
NAAQS 
by October 
2021. 
Environmental 
and 
industry 
groups challenged 
the 
2015 
 ozone NAAQS 
in the 
U.S. Court 
of Appeals 
for the 
D.C. Circuit. 
On August 
23, 2019, 
the court 
denied all 
the 
 petitions for 
review against 
the 2015 primary 
NAAQS but 
concluded that 
the EPA 
had not provided 
a sufficient 
 rationale for 
its decision 
on the 
2015 secondary 
NAAQS and 
remanded that 
standard to 
the EPA. 
Prior to 
the 
 court s decision, EPA initiated another periodic review of the 
ozone NAAQS. 
This most recent review culminated 
 in a final 
rule by the 
EPA 
on December 
31, 2020 to 
retain all aspects 
of the 2015 
ozone NAAQS, including 
the 
 secondary 
standard 
with 
additional 
rationale 
in 
response 
to 
the 
court s 
2019 decision. 
It 
remains 
to 
be 
seen 
 whether there 
will be 
legal challenges 
to the 
December 2020 
final rule, 
or whether 
the EPA 
will reconsider 
the 
 rule under the new administration. More stringent ozone or PM NAAQS, if promulgated, would require new 
SIPs 
 to be 
developed and 
filed with 
the EPA 
and may 
trigger additional 
control technology 
for mining 
equipment 
or 
 coal-burning facilities, 
or result 
in additional 
challenges to 
permitting and 
expansion efforts. 
This could 
also be 
 the case 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
any 
new 
requirements 
triggered 
by any 
future, 
more 
stringent 
 NAAQS for nitrogen 
oxide and SO
 2
 , although the 
EPA 
promulgated a final 
rule on March 
18, 2019 that 
retains, 
 without revision, the existing NAAQS for SO
 2
 
of 75 parts per billion average over an hour. 
 Cross State Air Pollution Rule, or CSAPR.
 
The CAA includes a so-called Good Neighbor 
Provision that requires 
 upwind states to 
eliminate their significant 
contributions to 
downwind states 
nonattainment of the 
NAAQS. On 
 July 6, 2011, 
the EPA 
finalized the CSAPR, 
which was 
meant to satisfy 
this Good Neighbor 
Provision. CSAPR 
 requires the 
District of 
Columbia and 
27 states 
from Texas 
eastward (not 
including the 
New England 
states or 
 Delaware) to reduce power plant emissions that 
cross state lines and significantly contribute to ozone 
and/or fine

 particle 
pollution 
in 
downwind 
states. 
Following 
litigation 
in the 
D.C. Circuit 
and 
U.S. Supreme 
Court, 
the first 
 phase of 
the nitrogen 
oxide and 
SO2 emissions 
reductions required 
by CSAPR 
commenced in 
January 2015; 
 further reductions of both pollutants in the second phase 
of CSAPR became effective in January 2017. 

 EPA 
subsequently 
published 
the 
CSAPR 
Update 
Rule 
in 
2016, 
seeking 
to 
impose 
nitrogen 
oxide 
emissions 
 reductions in 
22 upwind 
states subject 
to CSAPR. 
Subsequently, 
in 2018, 
EPA 
published the 
CSAPR Close-
 Out, which found 
that it would 
not it would 
not be feasible 
to impose cost-effective 
emissions on twenty 
upwind 
 states before 2023, 
which was two 
years after 
the CAA-mandated 
2021 deadline 
for states to 
bring their 
areas 
 of severe 
nonattainment into 
compliance with 
the 2008 
NAAQS. 
Both the 
CSAPR Update 
Rule and 
CSAPR 
 Close-Out 
were 
subject 
to 
legal 
challenges 
and 
each 
was 
ultimately 
vacated 
by 
the 
United 
States 
Court 
of 
 Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. 

 On March 15, 
2021, EPA 
finalized a rule 
update that requires 
additional emissions 
reduction of nitrogen 
oxides 
 from power plants in 
twelve states. 
Additional emission reduction 
requirements in these 
states could adversely 
 affect the demand for coal. 

 On April 
30, 
2021, 
EPA 
finalized 
the 
Revised 
CSAPR 
Update Rule, 
which 
fully 
addressed 
twenty-one 
states 
 outstanding interstate pollution transport obligations for the 2008 NAAQS for ozone. 
For nine states, EPA found 
 that 
their 
projected 
2021 
emissions 
do 
not 
significantly 
contribute 
to 
non-attainment 
and/or 
maintenance 
 problems in downwind states. 
The remaining twelve states 
were found to 
contribute to the non-attainment and/or 
 maintenance 
problems 
in 
downwind 
states. 
EPA 
indicated 
that 
it 
would 
issue 
new 
or 
amended 
Federal 
 Implementation Plans 
requiring additional 
emissions reductions 
from electricity 
generating units 
in those states 
 beginning in the 2021 ozone season. 
 Mercury and Air 
Toxic 
Standards, or MATS.
 
The EPA 
published the final 
MATS 
rule in the 
Federal Register 
on 
 February 16, 
2012. 
The 
MATS 
rule 
revised 
the 
New 
Source 
Performance 
Standards, 
or 
NSPS, 
for 
nitrogen 
 oxides, 
SO2 
and 
PM 
for 
new 
and 
modified 
coal-fueled 
electricity 
generating 
plants, 
and 
imposed 
Maximum 
 Achievable Control 
Technology, 
or MACT, 
emission limits 
on hazardous 
air pollutants, 
or HAPs, 
from new 
and 
 existing coal-fueled and oil-fueled electricity generating plants. MACT standards limit emissions of mercury, 
acid 
 gas HAPs, non-mercury HAP 
metals and organic 
HAPs. The rule 
provided three years 
for compliance with 
MACT 
 standards and 
a possible 
fourth year 
if a 
state permitting 
agency determined 
that such 
was necessary 
for the 
 installation of 
controls. Although 
the MATS 
rule 
has been 
and continues 
to be 
the subject 
of EPA 
review 
and 
 litigation, it remains 
in effect and 
has contributed to the 
need for many coal-fired 
power plants to install 
addition 
 pollution controls, convert to natural gas, or retire. 
 Following issuance 
of the 
final MATS 
rule, numerous 
petitions for 
review were 
filed. 
After proceedings 
before 
 the U.S. 
Court of Appeals 
for the 
D.C. Circuit, 
the U.S. Supreme 
Court on 
June 29, 2015 
held that 
EPA interpreted 
 the CAA 
unreasonably when 
it deemed 
cost irrelevant 
to the 
decision to 
regulate HAPs 
from new 
and existing 
 coal-fueled 
and 
oil-fueled 
power 
plants. 
The 
Supreme 
Court 
remanded 
the 
case 
to 
the 
D.C. 
Circuit, 
which 
 ultimately allowed 
the rule 
to remain 
in effect 
while EPA 
promulgated a 
series of 
supplemental findings 
on the 
 costs and benefits of the rule in response to the Supreme 
Court s ruling. 

 Most recently, 
on May 
22, 2020, 
the EPA 
finalized a 
supplemental finding, 
or Supplemental 
Cost Finding, 
that 
 health and environmental 
benefits not directly 
related to mercury 
pollution should 
not be included 
in the benefit 
 portion of the analysis. 
Using this framework EPA 
found that the costs of the MATS 
rule grossly outweigh any 
 possible 
benefits 
and, 
therefore, 
that 
that 
regulating 
HAPs 
from 
coal-fired 
and 
oil-fired 
power 
plants 
is 
not 
 appropriate and necessary under 
the CAA. 
However, EPA determined that while it could revise 
the cost-benefit 
 analysis for the MATS rule, it could not remove coal-fired plants from HAPs regulation. 
The MATS rule therefore 
 remains 
in 
effect. 
EPA 
also 
determined 
in 
the 
Supplemental 
Cost 
Finding 
that 
the 
MATS 
rule 
is 
adequately 
 protective 
of 
public 
health, 
as 
required 
by 
the 
CAA s 
residual 
risk 
and 
technology 
review 
provisions. 

 Westmoreland 
Mining Holdings, 
a coal 
company, 
filed a 
petition with 
the D.C. 
Circuit in 
May 2020 
challenging 
 the 
legality 
of 
the 
MATS 
rule. 
Health 
and 
medical 
groups 
and 
other 
industry 
groups 
filed 
a 
petition 
of 
review 
 opposing the 
Supplemental 
Cost Finding, 
and 
its reversal 
of the 
previous 
finding 
that 
it was 
 appropriate 
and 
 necessary 
to 
regulate 
HAPs. 
Environmental 
groups 
also 
challenge 
the 
EPA s 
residual 
risk 
and 
technology 
 review of the MATS 
rule, arguing that more 
stringent standards are 
necessary. 
This litigation remains ongoing. 

 While the vast majority of coal-fired power 
producers have already complied with the 2012 MATS rule standards, 
 any future reductions 
in the 
standards due 
to the ongoing 
litigation or 
additional EPA 
action could 
increase the 
 cost of coal-fired electric power generation and negatively impact 
the demand for coal.

 Clean Power Plan and Affordable Clean Energy, or ACE
 . In 2014, the EPA proposed a sweeping rule, known as 
 the Clean 
Power 
Plan, to 
cut carbon 
emissions 
from existing 
electricity 
generating 
units, 
including coal-fired 
 power plants. A final 
version of the Clean 
Power Plan was adopted in 
August 2015. The Clean Power 
Plan aimed 
 to 
reduce 
carbon 
dioxide 
emissions 
from 
electrical 
power 
generation 
by 
32 
by 
2030 
relative 
to 
2005 
levels 
 through the reduction of 
emissions from coal-burning 
power plants and increased 
use of renewable energy 
and 
 energy conservation 
methods. 
Under the 
Clean 
Power 
Plan, states 
were free 
to 
reduce emissions 
by various 
 means 
and 
were 
to 
submit 
emissions 
reduction 
plans 
to 
the 
EPA 
by 
September 
2016 
or, 
with 
an 
approved 
 extension, September 
2018. If 
a state 
had not 
submitted a 
plan by 
then, the 
Clean Power 
Plan authorized 
the 
 EPA to 
impose its own 
plan on that state. 
In order to 
determine a state s 
goal, the EPA 
divided the country 
into 
 three regions based on connected regional electricity grids. 
States were to implement their plans by focusing 
on 
 (i) increasing the generation efficiency 
of existing fossil fuel plants, (ii) substituting 
lower carbon dioxide emitting 
 natural gas generation 
for coal-powered generation and 
(iii) substituting generation from 
new zero carbon 
dioxide 
 emitting renewable sources for fossil fuel powered 
generation. States were permitted to use 
regionally available 
 low carbon generation sources when substituting for 
in-state coal generation and to coordinate with 
other states 
 to develop multi-state plans. 

 Following 
adoption, 
in 
2015 
twenty-seven 
states 
sued 
the 
EPA 
in 
the 
D.C. 
Circuit, 
claiming 
that 
the 
EPA 
 overstepped 
its 
legal 
authority 
in adopting 
the 
Clean 
Power 
Plan. In 
February 
2016, the 
U.S. 
Supreme 
Court 
 ordered the EPA 
to halt enforcement of the Clean 
Power Plan until the lower court ruled on 
the lawsuit and until 
 the Supreme Court determined whether or not to hear 
the case. 

 In a parallel 
litigation, twenty-five 
states and other 
parties filed lawsuits 
challenging the 
EPA s 
final NSPS rules 
 for carbon 
dioxide emissions 
from new, 
modified, and 
reconstructed 
power plants 
under the 
CAA. One 
of the 
 primary issues 
in these 
lawsuits was 
the EPA s establishment of standards 
of performance based 
on technologies 
 including carbon capture and sequestration, or CCS. 
New coal plants could not meet the new standards unless 
 they implement 
CCS. 
In 
conjunction 
with 
the 
EPA s 
proposal 
to 
rescind 
the 
Clean 
Power 
Plan, 
the 
EPA 
also 
 requested a stay of the NSPS litigation. The D.C. Circuit 
granted the request. 

 In 
October 
2017, 
the 
EPA 
commenced 
rulemaking 
proceedings 
to 
rescind 
the 
Clean 
Power 
Plan, 
and 
in 
 December 
2017, 
the 
EPA 
published 
an 
Advanced 
Notice 
of 
Proposed 
Rulemaking 
announcing 
its 
intent 
to 
 commence a 
new rulemaking 
to replace 
the Clean 
Power Plan 
with an 
alternative framework for 
regulating carbon 
 dioxide. The rulemaking 
would culminate 
in the EPA 
replacing the Clean 
Power Plan with 
ACE. On September 
 17, 2019, 
the U.S. 
Court of 
Appeals for 
the D.C. 
Circuit dismissed 
the Clean 
Power 
Plan litigation 
and NSPS 
 litigation as moot in light of the ACE rule. 

 On June 
19, 2019, 
the EPA 
finalized the 
ACE rule 
as a 
replacement for 
the Clean 
Power Plan. 
The ACE 
rule 
 establishes emission guidelines 
for states to develop 
plans to address greenhouse 
gas emissions from existing 
 coal-fired power plants. 
The ACE rule 
has several components: 
a determination of 
the best system 
of emission 
 reduction for 
greenhouse 
gas emissions 
from coal-fired 
power plants, 
a list 
of candidate 
technologies 
states 
 can use when 
developing their 
plans, and new 
implementing regulations 
for emission guidelines 
under Section 
 111(d) 
of the CAA. 
Unlike the 
Clean Power 
Plan, the 
ACE rule 
only includes 
as candidate 
technologies those 
 that increase the efficiency of individual emission units, also referred to as heat rate improvement measures; the 
 ACE 
rule 
does 
not 
include 
other 
methods 
such 
as 
co-firing 
with 
natural 
gas 
or 
adding 
renewable 
generation 
 facilities. 

 Upon 
finalization 
of 
the 
ACE 
rule, 
the 
rule 
was 
subject 
to 
a 
challenge 
in 
the 
D.C. 
Circuit 
in 
American 
Lung 
 Association et al. v. 
EPA, et 
al. 
On January 19, 2021, 
the D.C. Circuit vacated 
the ACE rule and remanded 
the 
 question of 
the best 
system of 
emission reduction 
for carbon 
dioxide emissions 
from existing 
power plants 
to 
 EPA for further consideration. 
In reaching its decision, the court found that ACE would not be the most effective 
 means of 
reducing emissions, 
and further 
rejected the 
idea that 
EPA 
is limited 
under the 
Clean Air 
Act to 
only 
 regulate emissions reductions at the 
source. 
On February 22, 2021, the 
D.C. Circuit Court granted EPA s motion 
 to stay issuance of the mandate to repeal until EPA 
could respond 
to the remand in a new rulemaking action. 

 In addition 
to potential 
CAA regulatory 
changes, it 
is possible 
that other 
future 
international, 
federal and 
state 
 initiatives 
to 
control 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions 
could 
increase 
costs 
associated 
with 
coal 
production 
and 
 consumption, 
such 
as 
costs 
for 
additional 
controls 
to 
reduce 
carbon 
dioxide 
emissions 
or 
costs 
to 
purchase 
 emissions reduction 
credits to 
comply with 
future emissions 
trading programs. 
Future regulation 
in the 
United 
 States could 
occur pursuant 
to future 
treaty commitments, 
new domestic 
legislation or 
regulation 
by the 
EPA. 

 On 
February 
19, 
2021, 
the 
United 
States 
rejoined

international 
climate

 Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change in Paris, France 
during December 2015, also known 
as the 
 Paris Agreement. 
President Trump previously 
withdrew the United States from 
the Paris Agreement, beginning 
 a four-year 
exit process. 
In an 
executive 
order, 
President 
Biden directed 
that 
federal agencies 
review recent 
 actions that 
the President 
believes 
may interfere 
with 
the United 
States 
participation 
in the 
Paris 
Agreement. 

 While 
the 
Paris 
Agreement 
sets 
only 
voluntary 
pledges 
for 
reducing 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions, 
the 
recent 
 executive actions signal 
a shift 
toward consideration of 
new or more 
stringent federal regulations 
to further reduce 
 greenhouse gas emissions 
in the United 
States. 
In addition, many 
states, regions and 
governmental bodies have 
 already 
adopted 
their 
own 
greenhouse 
gas 
emission 
reduction 
initiatives 
and 
have 
or 
are 
considering 
the 
 imposition of fees 
or taxes based 
on the such 
emission by certain 
facilities, including coal-fired electric 
generating 
 facilities. 
Others have announced their intent 
to increase the use of renewable 
energy sources, with the goal 
of 
 displacing coal 
and other 
fossil fuels. 
Federal legislation 
along these 
lines is 
also a 
possibility. 
Depending on 
 the particular regulatory programs or new laws 
enacted at the federal and state 
levels, the demand for coal could 
 be negatively impacted, which would have an adverse effect 
on our operations. 
 There have 
also been 
numerous challenges 
to the 
permitting of 
new coal-fired 
power plants 
by environmental 
 organizations and state 
regulators for concerns related 
to greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
For instance, various 
state 
 regulatory authorities 
have rejected 
the construction 
of new 
coal-fueled power 
plants based 
on the 
uncertainty 
 surrounding the potential 
costs associated with 
greenhouse gas emissions 
under future laws. 
In addition, several 
 permits issued to 
new coal-fueled power 
plants without greenhouse 
gas emission limits 
have been appealed 
to 
 the EPA's 
Environmental 
Appeals Board. 
A federal 
appeals court 
allowed a 
lawsuit pursuing 
federal common 
 law claims to proceed 
against certain utilities 
on the basis 
that they may 
have created a 
public nuisance due 
to 
 their emissions of 
carbon dioxide, while 
a second federal 
appeals court dismissed 
a similar case 
on procedural 
 grounds. 
The United States Supreme Court overturned that decision in June 2011, holding that federal common 
 law 
provides 
no 
basis 
for 
public 
nuisance 
claims 
against 
utilities 
due 
to 
their 
carbon 
dioxide 
emissions. 
The 
 United 
States 
Supreme 
Court 
did 
not, 
however, 
decide 
whether 
similar 
claims 
can 
be 
brought 
under 
state 
 common law. 
As a result, tort-type 
liabilities remain a concern. 
To 
the extent that these 
risks affect our 
current 
 and prospective customers, 
they may reduce the demand 
for coal-fired power, and may affect long-term demand 
 for coal. 
 Regional Haze.
 
The EPA 
promulgated a regional 
haze program designed 
to protect and 
to improve visibility 
at 
 and around Class I Areas, which are generally national parks, national wilderness areas and international parks. 
 This program 
may restrict 
the construction 
of 
new 
coal-fired 
power 
plants, 
the 
operation 
of 
which 
may 
impair 
 visibility 
at 
and 
around 
the 
Class 
I 
Areas. 
Additionally, 
the 
program 
requires 
certain 
existing 
coal-fired 
power 
 plants 
to install 
additional 
control measures 
designed 
to limit 
haze-causing 
emissions, 
such 
as SO2, 
nitrogen 
 oxide and 
PM. States 
were required 
to submit 
Regional Haze 
SIPs to 
the EPA 
in 2007; 
however, 
many states 
 did 
not 
meet 
that 
deadline. 
In 
2016, 
the 
EPA 
finalized 
revisions 
to 
the 
Regional 
Haze 
Rule 
which 
addresses 
 requirements for the 
second planning 
period. In 
September 2019, the 
EPA 
issued final regional 
haze guidance 
 that 
indicates 
that 
a 
re-evaluation 
of 
sources 
already 
subject 
to 
best 
available 
retrofit 
technologies 
is 
likely 
 unnecessary. The guidance also encourages states to 
balance visibility benefits against 
other factors in selecting 
 the 
measures 
necessary 
to 
make 
 reasonable 
progress 
toward 
natural 
visibility 
conditions. 
Finally, 
when 
 comparing 
various 
control 
options 
to 
determine 
which 
ones 
may 
be 
 cost-effective , 
the 
final 
guidance 
 recommends comparing cost to 
visibility benefits. SIPs were 
required by July 31, 
2021. 
On August 30, 2022 
EPA 
 issued a final action finding 
that 15 states had failed 
to meet the July 31, 
2021 deadline. 
Such failure triggers a 
 two 
year 
deadline 
for 
EPA 
to 
promulgate 
a 
Federal 
Implementation 
Plan 
unless 
the 
states 
submits 
and 
EPA 
 approves a SIP that 
meets the applicable requirements.

If states adopt SIPs 
with more stringent requirements, 
 demand for coal could be affected. 
 New Source 
Review, 
or NSR
 . Pursuant 
to NSR 
regulations, 
stationary sources 
of air 
pollution must 
obtain an 
 NSR permit prior to beginning 
construction of a new 
 major source of emissions 
or a major modification 
of an 
 existing major source. 
If a project 
is determined to 
trigger NSR, Prevention 
of Significant Deterioration 
regulations 
 require the project to implement Best 
Available Control Technology 
and/or Non-Attainment New Source Review 
 Lowest Achievable Emission Rate control technology. 
 Beginning in the late 1990s, the EPA filed lawsuits against owners of many 
coal-fired power plants in the eastern 
 U.S. alleging that 
the owners performed 
non-routine maintenance, causing increased emissions 
that should have 
 triggered 
the 
application 
of 
these NSR 
standards. 
Some of 
these 
lawsuits 
have 
been settled 
with 
the 
owners 
 agreeing to install additional emission control devices in 
their coal-fired power plants.

 The remaining litigation and uncertainty around the NSR program rules could impact 
demand for coal. 
In recent 
 years, 
EPA 
proposed 
and 
promulgated 
several 
revisions 
to its 
NSR 
regulations 
and policies 
concerning 
NSR 
 permitting. 
For example, 
one such 
change, known 
as the 
Project Emissions 
Accounting Rule 
on October 
22, 
 2020, revises the NSR 
regulations to clarify that recent 
emission decreases can be considered 
in part of the 
NSR 
 applicability test. 
In addition, the EPA on November 14, 2018 issued a final 
rule that clarified the appropriate test 
 for determining 
whether two nominally 
separate modifications to 
existing facilities 
should be 
considered in 
a single 
 NSR applicability analysis. 
While these changes have 
the potential to reduce 
NSR permitting burdens for 
coal-
 fired power plants and other coal-burning 
facilities, the Biden Administration has reversed some policies adopted 
 by the Trump Administration and may seek 
to tighten NSR regulations and guidance. 
 Coke Ovens.
 
Coke Oven 
Batteries and 
Coke Ovens: 
Pushing, Quenching, 
and Battery 
Stacks are 
two source 
 categories 
regulated 
by 
the 
CAA. 
The 
initial 
technology-based 
standards 
for 
Coke 
Oven 
Batteries 
were 
 promulgated 
by 
EPA 
in 
1993. 
In 
2003, 
EPA 
issued 
technology-based 
standards 
for 
Coke 
Ovens: 
Pushing, 
 Quenching, 
and Battery 
Stacks. 
In 2005, 
EPA 
revised 
the technology 
-based standards 
and issued 
risk-based 
 standards following 
a residual 
risk review. 
On June 
26, 2020, 
the United 
States District 
Court for 
the Northern 
 District 
of 
California 
found 
EPA 
had 
violated 
its 
statutory 
duty 
to 
perform 
a 
technology 
review 
of 
its 
initial 
 technology-based standards for Coke Ovens: 
Pushing, Quenching, and Battery Stacks and 
a residual risk review 
 of those 
standards. The court 
also found 
that EPA had violated 
its statutory 
duty to 
conduct a 
follow-up technology 
 review and second 
residual risk 
review of the 
standards for 
Coke Oven 
Batteries. The court 
held that 
EPA 
has 
 30 months 
to comply 
with its 
statutory duty 
for these 
two source 
categories. To 
the extent 
that EPA 
ultimately 
 promulgates more stringent technology-based standards as 
a result of 
the court-ordered technology and residual 
 risk reviews, it could affect our current and prospective 
customers and may affect long-term demand 
for coal. 
 On January 21, 
2021, President Biden issued 
an executive order 
that ordered the 
review of certain 
environmental 
 regulations promulgat 
ed under 
the Trump 
administration. 
Those environmental 
regulations 
include ozone 
and 
 particulate matter NAAQS, the ACE rule, 
and other air emission rules potentially 
affecting coal-fired power plants 
 and other coal-burning facilities. It is unclear what affect 
this order will have on the demand for coal. 
 Clean Water Act of 1972 
 The U.S. Clean Water Act of 1972, or the CWA, 
and corresponding state law governs the discharge of toxic and 
 non-toxic pollutants into the waters of the United States. CWA requirements 
may directly or indirectly affect U.S. 
 coal mining operations. 
 Water Discharge.
 
The CWA and corresponding state laws affect coal mining operations by imposing restrictions 
 on discharges 
of wastewater into 
waters of 
the United 
States through the 
National Pollutant Discharge 
Elimination 
 System, 
or 
NPDES, 
or 
an 
equally 
stringent 
program 
delegated 
to 
a 
state 
agency. 
The 
EPA 
and 
states 
may 
 develop 
standards 
and 
limitations 
for 
certain 
pollutants, 
including 
through 
the 
technology-based 
standard 
 program and water quality 
standard program. These restrictions often 
require us to pre-treat 
the wastewater prior 
 to discharging 
it. NPDES 
permits require 
regular monitoring, 
reporting and 
compliance with 
effluent limitations. 
 New requirements 
under 
the 
CWA 
and 
corresponding 
state 
laws 
may 
cause 
us 
to 
incur 
significant 
additional 
 costs that could adversely affect our 
operating results. 
 Dredge and Fill Permits.
 
Many mining activities, such as the development 
of refuse impoundments, fresh water 
 impoundments, 
refuse fills, 
and other 
similar structures, 
may result 
in 
impacts 
to 
waters 
of the 
United 
States, 
 including wetlands, streams 
and, in certain 
instances, man-made conveyances that 
have a hydrologic 
connection 
 to such streams 
or wetlands. Under 
the CWA, 
coal companies are 
also required to 
obtain a Section 
404 permit 
 from 
the 
USACE 
prior 
to 
conducting 
certain 
mining 
activities, 
such 
as 
the 
development 
of 
refuse 
and 
slurry 
 impoundments, fresh water impoundments, 
refuse fills and other similar 
structures that may affect 
waters of the 
 United 
States, 
including 
wetlands, 
streams 
and, 
in 
certain 
instances, 
man-made 
conveyances 
that 
have 
a 
 hydrologic connection 
to streams 
or wetlands. 
The USACE 
is authorized 
to issue 
general nationwide 
permits 
 for specific 
categories of 
activities 
that are 
similar in 
nature and 
that are 
determined 
to have 
minimal adverse 
 effects on 
the environment. 
Permits issued 
pursuant to 
Nationwide Permit 
21, or 
NWP 21, 
generally authorize 
 the 
disposal 
of 
dredged 
and 
fill 
material 
from 
surface 
coal 
mining 
activities 
into 
waters 
of 
the 
United 
States, 
 subject to certain restrictions. Since 
March 2007, permits under 
NWP 21 were reissued 
for a five-year period 
with 
 new 
provisions 
intended 
to 
strengthen 
environmental 
protections. 
There 
must 
be 
appropriate 
mitigation 
in 
 accordance 
with 
nationwide 
general 
permit 
conditions 
rather 
than 
less 
restricted 
state-required 
mitigation 
 requirements, 
and 
permit 
holders 
must 
receive 
explicit 
authorization 
from 
the 
USACE 
before 
proceeding

 proposed mining activities. The USACE may also issue individual permits 
for mining activities that do not qualify 
 for Nationwide Permit 21. 
 The CWR/Navigable Waters 
Protection, or NWPR. 
Recent regulatory actions 
and court decisions 
have created 
 some 
uncertainty 
over 
the 
scope 
of 
CWA 
jurisdiction. 
On 
June 
29, 
2015, 
the 
EPA 
and 
the 
USACE 
jointly 
 promulgated final rules, collectively known as the Clean Water Rule, or the CWR, redefining the scope of waters 
 protected 
under 
the 
CWA, 
revising 
regulations 
that 
had 
been 
in 
place 
for 
more 
than 
25 
years. 
These 
rules 
 expanded 
the 
scope 
of 
CWA 
jurisdiction, 
making 
discharges 
into 
more 
bodies 
of water 
subject 
to 
the 
CWA s 
 permitting and 
other requirements. 
Following the 
CWR s promulgation, 
numerous industry 
groups, states, 
and 
 environmental groups challenged 
the CWR. On October 
9, 2015, the U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the 
Sixth Circuit 
 stayed the 
CWR s 
implementation 
nationwide, 
pending further 
action 
in court. 
Further, 
on February 
28, 2017, 
 President Trump signed an executive order directing the relevant executive agencies to review 
the CWR, and on 
 July 27, 
2017, the 
EPA 
and the 
USACE published 
a proposed 
rule to rescind 
the CWR. 
On January 
22, 2018, 
 the Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit s decision, ruling that 
jurisdiction over challenges to the CWR rests 
 with the federal district courts and not with the appellate courts, which was followed by the dissolution 
of the stay 
 by the Sixth Circuit, and 
on February 6, 2018, in 
response to the January 2018 Supreme 
Court decision, the EPA 
 and USACE published 
a final rule 
to postpone the 
adoption of CWR 
and maintain 
the status quo 
(the pre 2015 
 rule) 
through 
February 
6, 
2020 
pending 
the 
agencies 
review 
of 
the 
CWR. 
Multiple 
states 
and 
environmental 
 groups have filed challenges to this 
delay. On 
August 16, 2018, the federal court 
in South Carolina enjoined the 
 February 6, 2018 rule, effectively reinstating 
the CWR in Virginia and 
Pennsylvania (where we have operations) 
 and in 24 other states. 
 On April 
21, 2020, 
the EPA 
and the 
USACE published 
the Navigable 
Waters 
Protection Rules, 
or the 
NWPR. 
 The 
NWPR 
revises 
the 
definition 
of 
waters 
of 
the 
United 
States, 
replacing 
the 
CWR. 
The 
NWPR 
shrinks 
the 
 agencies jurisdiction, particularly 
as it relates to tributaries 
and adjacent waters. The 
NWPR went into effect 
on 
 June 22, 2020. 
The NWPR was 
enjoined in Colorado, 
but this decision 
was overturned by 
the Tenth Circuit Court 
 of Appeals. On January 18, 2023, 
the EPA and the USACE published a final rule redefining waters of 
the United 
 States. The new 
definition reflects 
certain aspects 
of the pre-2015 
definition as well 
as consideration 
of recent 
 Supreme Court decisions. 
It enlarges the agencies jurisdiction over waters as compared 
to the NWPR. 
 On April 22, 2020, in an unrelated 
case the Supreme Court ruled that provisions 
of the CWA require an NPDES 
 permit when 
there is 
a direct 
discharge from 
a point 
source to 
navigable 
waters 
or the 
functionally 
equivalent 
 discharge to groundwater. 
The NWPR, however, 
had excluded groundwater 
from the agencies 
jurisdiction. On 
 January 
21, 
2021, 
EPA 
issued 
guidance 
applying 
the 
ruling 
of 
the 
Supreme 
Court 
to 
the 
NPDES 
permitting 
 program. 
Under the 
Biden 
Administration, the 
EPA 
rescinded 
this guidance 
memorandum, 
thus eliminating 
a 
 new factor that likely would have reduced clean water 
protections. 

 On 
January 
24, 
2022, 
the 
United 
States 
Supreme 
Court 
agreed 
to 
hear 
a 
case 
that 
could 
undermine 
key 
 provisions of the January 18, 2023 final rule. 
A decision is expected by June 2023. 
Litigation of the definition of 
 waters of 
the United 
States is 
likely to 
continue. 
Uncertainty surrounding 
the definition 
of waters 
of the 
United 
 States remains, including what impact it may have on our operations. 
 Effluent Limitations 
Guidelines for 
the Steam 
Electric Power 
Generating Industry. 
On September 
30, 2015, 
the 
 EPA published a 
final rule setting new or additional requirements for 
various wastewater discharges from steam 
 electric power plants. 
The rule set 
zero discharge 
requirements for 
some waste streams, 
as well as 
new, more 
 stringent limits 
for arsenic, 
mercury, 
selenium and 
nitrogen applicable 
to certain 
other waste 
streams. On 
April 
 12, 2019, the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit agreed with 
environmental groups that the portions of the 
 rule regulating legacy wastewater 
and residual combustion leachate 
are unlawful and vacated 
those portions of 
 the rule. 

 On August 31, 2020, the EPA finalized a rule to revise the guidelines and standards for the steam electric power 
 generating point source category applicable to two categories of wastewater streams regulated by 
the 2015 rule: 
 flue 
gas 
desulfurization 
wastewater, 
or 
FGD, 
and 
bottom 
ash 
transport 
water, 
or 
BA. 
With 
respect 
to 
FGD, 
 selenium standards are 
less stringent than 
under the 2015 
rule, and certain 
types of facilities, 
such as facilities 
 with 
high 
FGD 
flow, 
low 
utilization 
boilers 
and 
those 
set 
to 
retire 
coal 
combustion 
units, 
are 
subject 
to 
less 
 stringent 
effluent 
limits. 
The 
compliance 
deadline 
for 
FGD 
technology-based 
wastewater 
limits 
was 
extended 
 from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2025. With respect to 
BA, the EPA, among other 
things, eliminated a 
 strict no-discharge 
requirement and 
implemented a 
not-to-exceed ten-percent 
volumetric purge. 
We cannot 
at 
 this time predict how this rule will be enforced by the new 
Biden administration or if it will seek a revision.

 The Biden 
Administration s 
January 20, 2021 
executive order 
for review 
of environmental 
regulations indicated 
 the Biden Administration would review the NWPR amongst other 
CWA-related regulations. 

 Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 
 The 
Surface 
Mining 
Control 
and 
Reclamation 
Act of 
1977, 
or the 
SMCRA, 
which 
is administered 
by the 
U.S. 
 Office 
of 
Surface 
Mining 
Reclamation 
and 
Enforcement, 
or 
OSM, 
establishes 
operational, 
reclamation 
and 
 closure standards for 
all aspects of 
surface mining and 
many aspects of 
underground mining in 
the United States. 
 Unlike the 
CAA and 
the CWA, 
SMCRA is 
primarily concerned 
with the 
holistic regulation 
of coal 
mining as 
an 
 industry. 
Its general environmental standards 
require surface operations 
to mine in such a 
way as to maximize 
 the 
utilization 
and 
conservation 
of 
coal 
while 
using 
the 
best 
technology 
currently 
available 
to 
minimize 
land 
 disturbance 
and 
adverse 
impacts 
on 
wildlife, 
fish, 
and 
environmental 
values. 
SMCRA 
requires 
operators 
to 
 accomplish these goals by restoring the land to its approximate 
pre-mining condition and contour. 
 The 
SMCRA 
implements 
its 
environmental 
standards 
through 
 cooperative 
federalism. 
Under 
the 
SMCRA, 
a 
 state 
may 
submit 
a 
qualifying 
surface 
mining 
regulatory 
scheme 
to 
the 
OSM, 
and 
request 
to 
exert 
exclusive 
 jurisdiction over surface mining activities 
within its territory. If OSM finds that the 
state s scheme meets SMCRA s 
 requirements and gives 
approval, the state 
becomes the primary 
regulatory authority 
with oversight from 
OSM. 
 If a state has a surface 
mining regulatory scheme that 
is less stringent than the surface 
mining standards under 
 SMCRA and OSM regulations, or if mining 
on federal lands is involved, the OSM 
will impose federal regulations 
 on surface mining 
in that state. Each 
of Virginia, West 
Virginia and Pennsylvania, 
where our Buchanan, 
Logan, 
 Greenbrier and Mon Valley operations are 
based, has adopted qualifying 
surface mining regulatory schemes and 
 has primary jurisdiction 
over surface mining 
activities within their 
respective territories. However, 
even if a state 
 gains approval for its surface mining regulatory program, the OSM retains significant federal oversight, including 
 the ability 
to perform 
inspections of 
all surface 
mining sites 
to ensure 
state program and 
mine operator 
compliance 
 with federal minimum standards. The OSM and its state counterparts 
also oversee and evaluate standards of: 
 
performance (both during operations and during reclamation); 
 
permitting 
(applications 
must 
describe 
the 
pre-mining 
environmental 
conditions 
and 
land 
use, 
the 
 intended mining and reclamation standards, and the post-mining 
use); 
 
financial assurance (SMCRA 
requires that mining companies 
post a bond sufficient 
to cover the cost 
of 
 reclaiming the site, 
and the 
bond is not 
released until 
mining is 
complete, the 
land has 
been reclaimed 
 and the OSM has approved the release); 
 
inspection and enforcement (including the issuance of notices of violation and the placement of a 
mining 
 operation, 
its 
owners 
and 
controllers 
on 
a 
federal 
database 
known 
as 
the 
Applicant 
Violator 
System, 
 meaning that such person or entity is blocked from obtaining 
future mining permits); and 
 
land restrictions (SMCRA prohibits surface mining on certain lands and also allows 
citizens to challenge 
 surface mining operations on the grounds that they will cause 
a negative environmental impact). 
 Regulations under 
the SMCRA 
and its 
state analogues 
provide that a 
mining permit 
or modification 
can, under 
 certain circumstances, 
be delayed, 
refused or 
revoked if 
we or 
any entity 
that owns 
or controls 
us or 
is under 
 common 
ownership 
or 
control 
with 
us 
have 
unabated 
permit 
violations 
or 
have 
been 
the 
subject 
of 
permit 
or 
 reclamation bond revocation or suspension. 
 Under the SMCRA 
and its state 
law counterparts, all 
coal mining applications must 
include mandatory ownership 
 and control information, 
which generally includes 
listing the names of 
the operator s officers 
and directors, and 
 its principal 
stockholders owning 
10 or 
more of 
its voting 
shares, among 
others. Ownership 
and control 
reporting 
 requirements are 
designed to 
allow regulatory 
review of 
any entities 
or persons 
deemed to 
have ownership 
or 
 control of 
a coal 
mine, and 
bar the 
granting of 
a coal 
mining permit 
to any 
such entity 
or person (including 
any 
 owner and controller who has 
had a mining permit 
revoked or suspended, or 
a bond or similar 
security forfeited 
 within the five-year period preceding a permit application or application for 
a permit revision. Similarly, regulatory 
 agencies also 
block the 
issuance of 
permits to 
applicants, their 
owners or 
their controlling 
persons, who 
have 
 outstanding permit violations that have not been timely 
abated. 

Table of Contents

35 
 These 
regulations 
define 
certain 
relationships, 
such 
as 
owning 
over 
50 
of 
stock 
in 
an 
entity 
or 
having 
the 
 authority to determine the manner in which the entity conducts mining operations, as constituting ownership 
and 
 control. Certain other relationships are presumed to constitute ownership or control, including among others, the 
 following: 
 
being an officer or director of an entity; 
 
being the operator of the coal mining operation; 
 
having the ability to commit the financial or real property assets or working resources of the permittee or 
 operator; and 
 
owning of record 10 or more of the mining operator. 
 This presumption, in some cases, can be 
rebutted where the person or entity can demonstrate 
that it in fact does 
 not 
or 
did 
not 
have 
authority 
directly 
or 
indirectly 
to 
determine 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
the 
relevant 
coal 
mining 
 operation is conducted. 
 We must file an ownership and control notice each time an entity obtains a 10 or greater interest in us. If we or 
 entities or persons 
deemed to 
have ownership 
of control 
of us have 
unabated violations 
of SMCRA 
or its state 
 law counterparts, 
have a 
coal mining 
permit suspended 
or revoked, 
or forfeit 
a reclamation 
bond, we 
and our 
 owners and 
controllers may 
be prohibited 
from obtaining 
new coal 
mining permits, 
or amendments 
to existing 
 permits, until such 
violations or other 
matters are corrected. 
This is known 
as being permit-blocked. 
Additionally, 
 if 
an 
owner 
or 
controller 
of 
us 
is 
deemed 
an 
owner 
or 
controller 
of 
other 
mining 
companies, 
we 
could 
be 
 permit-blocked 
based 
upon the 
violations 
of, or 
permit-blocked 
status 
of, an 
owner 
or controller 
of such 
other 
 mining 
companies. 
If 
our 
owner 
or 
controller 
were 
to 
become 
permit 
blocked, 
this 
could 
adversely 
affect 
 production from our properties. 
 In recent years, the 
permitting required for 
coal mining has been 
the subject of increasingly 
stringent regulatory 
 and administrative 
requirements 
and extensive 
activism and 
litigation by 
environmental 
groups. 
After a 
permit 
 application is 
prepared and 
submitted to 
the regulatory 
agency, 
it goes 
through a 
completeness and 
technical 
 review. 
Public 
notice 
of 
the 
proposed 
permit 
is 
given 
for 
a 
comment 
period 
before 
a 
permit 
can 
be 
issued. 
 Regulatory authorities 
have considerable 
discretion in 
the timing 
of the 
permit issuance 
and the 
public has 
the 
 right 
to 
comment 
on 
and 
otherwise 
engage 
in 
the 
permitting 
process, 
including 
public 
hearings 
and 
through 
 intervention 
in 
the 
courts. 
Monetary 
sanctions 
and, 
in 
certain 
circumstances, 
even 
criminal 
sanctions 
may 
be 
 imposed for failure to comply with the SMCRA permits. Before a SMCRA permit is issued, a mine operator 
must 
 submit 
a 
bond 
or 
other 
form 
of 
financial 
security 
to 
guarantee 
the 
performance 
of 
reclamation 
bonding 
 requirements. 
 SMCRA provides for three 
categories of bonds: surety 
bonds, collateral bonds and 
self-bonds. A surety bond 
is 
 an 
indemnity 
agreement 
in 
a 
sum 
certain 
payable 
to 
the 
regulatory 
authority, 
executed 
by 
the 
permittee 
as 
 principal and 
which 
is supported 
by the 
performance 
guarantee of 
a surety 
corporation. 
A collateral 
bond can 
 take 
several 
forms, 
including 
cash, 
letters 
of 
credit, 
first 
lien 
security 
interest 
in 
property 
or 
other 
qualifying 
 investment securities. 
A self-bond 
is an indemnity 
agreement in 
a sum 
certain executed 
by the permittee 
or by 
 the permittee 
and any 
corporate guarantor 
made payable 
to the 
regulatory authority. 
For our 
U.S. Operations, 
 we meet our reclamation bonding requirements by posting surety 
bonds and participation in the Commonwealth 
 of Virginia bond pool. Our total amount of reclamation surety bonds outstanding was approximately 28.5
 million 
 as of December 31, 2022. The surety 
bond requirements for a mine represent the 
calculated cost to reclaim the 
 current operations if it ceased to operate in the 
current period. The cost calculation for each surety bond must be 
 completed according to the regulatory authority of each 
state. 
 The SMCRA Abandoned Mine Land Fund requires 
a fee on all coal 
produced in the United States. The proceeds 
 are used to rehabilitate 
lands mined and left 
unreclaimed prior to August 
3, 1977 and to pay 
health care benefit 
 costs of 
orphan beneficiaries 
of the Combined 
Fund created 
by the 
Coal Industry 
Retiree Health 
Benefit Act 
of 
 1992. The fee 
amount can change 
periodically based on 
changes in federal 
legislation. Pursuant to 
the Tax Relief 
 and Health Care Act of 2006, from October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2021, the fee is 0.31 and 0.13 per 
 Mt of 
surface-mined and underground-mined 
coal, respectively. See Item 2. 
 Properties for information 
regarding 
 reclamation and other taxes applicable to our U.S. mining 
properties.

 While SMCRA is 
a comprehensive statute, 
SMCRA does not 
supersede the need 
for compliance with 
other major 
 environmental statutes, 
including the 
Endangered Species 
Act of 
1973, or 
the ESA, 
CAA, CWA, 
the Resource 
 Conservation 
and 
Recovery 
Act 
of 
1976, 
or 
the 
RCRA, 
and 
the 
Comprehensive 
Environmental 
Response, 
 Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA. 
 National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
 The National Environmental Policy 
Act of 1969, 
or NEPA, applies to mining 
operations or permitting requirements 
 that require federal approvals, 
NEPA requires federal agencies to evaluate the 
environmental impact of all 
 major 
 federal actions 
significantly 
affecting 
the 
quality 
of the 
human environment. 
NEPA 
requires 
federal 
agencies, 
 such as the EPA or the OSM, 
to incorporate environmental considerations in their 
planning and decision-making. 
 The federal 
agency 
carrying 
out 
the 
requirements 
of 
NEPA 
must 
prepare 
a 
detailed 
statement 
assessing 
the 
 environmental impact 
of and 
alternatives to 
the particular 
action requiring 
agency approval. 
These statements 
 are 
referred 
to 
as 
Environmental 
Impact 
Statements 
or 
Environmental 
Assessments. 
NEPA 
also 
defines 
the 
 processes for evaluating 
and communicating environmental 
consequences of federal 
decisions and actions, 
such 
 as 
the 
permitting 
of 
new 
mine 
development 
on 
federal 
lands. 
U.S. 
coal 
mining 
companies 
must 
provide 
 information 
to 
agencies 
with 
respect 
to 
proposed 
actions 
that 
will 
be 
under 
the 
authority 
of 
the 
federal 
 government. 
The 
NEPA 
process 
involves 
public 
participation 
and 
can 
involve 
lengthy 
timeframes. 
Ultimately, 
 federal agencies may require mitigation measures pursuant 
to their NEPA 
review. 
 On 
July 
16, 
2020, 
the 
White 
House 
Council 
on 
Environmental 
Quality, 
or 
the 
CEQ 
finalized 
a 
proposed 
rule, 
 which went into effect on September 14, 2020. 
The new rule made it easier to obtain approval 
for new projects, 
 including by eliminating the need to evaluate so-called 
cumulative impacts which could ultimately limit agencies 
 consideration of climate change 
and greenhouse gas 
emissions. However, 
pursuant to Executive 
Order 13990, 
 CEQ began 
a comprehensive 
review of 
the 2020 
rule and 
announced a 
phased approach 
to amending 
NEPA 
 regulations. An Interim Final 
Rule was issued June 
29, 2021 which extended 
the deadline for Federal 
agencies 
 to develop or update their NEPA 
implementing procedures to conform to the CEQ regulations 
by two years. 
 Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1995 and Resource 
Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 
 The Solid 
Waste Disposal 
Act of 1965, 
or SWDA, 
was the 
first federal 
act to target 
waste disposal 
technology. 
 The 
SWDA 
governs 
disposal 
of 
both 
municipal 
and 
industrial 
waste, 
promotes 
advancement 
of 
waste 
 management technology 
and sets 
waste management 
standards. The 
SWDA was 
amended by 
the Resource 
 Conservation and 
Recovery 
Act of 
1976, or 
RCRA. RCRA 
affects 
U.S. coal 
mining operations 
by establishing 
 cradle to 
grave requirements 
for the 
generation, 
transportation, 
treatment, storage 
and disposal 
of solid 
and 
 hazardous 
wastes. 
The 
RCRA 
also 
addresses 
the 
environmental 
effects 
of 
certain 
past 
hazardous 
waste 
 treatment, storage 
and disposal 
practices, and 
may require 
a current 
or past 
site owner 
or operator 
to remove 
 improperly 
disposed 
hazardous 
wastes. 
The 
RCRA 
also 
sets 
forth 
a 
framework 
for 
managing 
certain 
non-
 hazardous 
solid 
wastes. 
Part 
or 
all 
of 
the 
RCRA 
program 
may 
be 
delegated 
to 
a 
state 
pursuant 
to 
a 
state 
 implementation plan if the state standards are at least 
as stringent as federal standards. 
 Subtitle C of the 
RCRA exempted fossil 
fuel combustion wastes 
from hazardous waste 
regulation until the 
EPA 
 completed 
a 
report 
to 
Congress 
and 
made 
a 
determination 
on 
whether 
the 
wastes 
should 
be 
regulated 
as 
 hazardous. On December 19, 2014, the EPA 
announced the final rule on disposal of coal combustion 
residuals, 
 or CCR 
or coal 
ash, by 
electric utilities 
and independent 
power producers. 
As finalized, 
the rule 
continues the 
 exemption of 
CCR from 
regulation as 
a hazardous 
waste, but 
does impose 
new requirements 
at existing 
CCR 
 surface impoundments 
and landfills 
that will need 
to be 
implemented over 
a number 
of different 
time-frames in 
 the coming months 
and years, 
as well as 
at new surface 
impoundments and 
landfills. On August 
24, 2018, the 
 U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held that certain provisions of the EPA s 
CCR rule were not sufficiently 
 protective, and it invalidated those provisions. Since then, the 
EPA has finalized 
changes to its CCR regulations 
 in response to 
some aspects of 
the court s ruling, primarily 
to regulate unlined ponds 
but extend certain 
deadlines 
 for initiating their closure, and allowing site-specific alternate 
liner determinations. 

 The Biden 
Administration s 
January 20, 2021 
executive order 
for review 
of environmental 
regulations indicated 
 that the 
Biden 
Administration will 
review 
environmental 
regulations 
affecting 
the 
management 
and disposal 
of 
 CCR. On January 
11, 
2022, the 
EPA 
announced that 
it was 
taking steps 
to protect 
groundwater from 
coal ash 
 contamination, including 
plans to 
finalize a 
federal permitting program 
for the 
disposal of 
coal ash 
and establishing 
 regulations for legacy coal 
ash surface impoundments. 
We cannot predict 
at this time if and/or 
when such rules 
 will go into effect.

 The EPA 
regulations on CCR 
management and disposal 
exempt coal ash 
that is disposed 
of at mine 
sites and 
 reserve any regulation thereof to the Office 
of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement 
or "OSMRE." After 
 proposing CCR regulations in 2007, 
the OSMRE suspended all rulemaking 
actions on CCRs, but 
could re-initiate 
 them 
in 
the 
future. 
In 
addition, 
while 
many 
mining 
wastes 
such 
as 
overburden 
and 
coal 
cleaning 
wastes 
are 
 exempt from 
RCRA hazardous 
waste regulations, 
certain wastes 
may be 
subject to 
the RCRA s 
requirements. 
 The RCRA also governs underground 
storage tanks containing hazardous 
substances and petroleum products, 
 which are used in some coal mining operations, although we do not have underground storage tanks associated 
 with our U.S. Operations. 
 The Biden 
Administration s 
January 20, 2021 
executive order 
for review 
of environmental 
regulations indicated 
 that the 
Biden 
Administration will 
review 
environmental 
regulations 
affecting 
the 
management 
and disposal 
of 
 CCR. 
It is unclear what effect this order will have 
on the demand for coal. 
 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, 
and Liability Act of 1980 
 Comprehensive Environmental 
Response, Compensation 
and Liability Act 
of 1980, or 
CERCLA, authorizes the 
 federal government 
and private parties 
to recover 
costs to 
address threatened 
or actual releases 
of hazardous 
 substances (broadly defined) that may 
endanger public health or the 
environment. Current owners and operators 
 of contaminated sites, past owners and operators 
of contaminated sites at the time hazardous 
substances were 
 disposed, 
parties that 
arranged 
for the 
disposal 
or transport 
of the 
hazardous 
substances 
and transporters 
of 
 hazardous substances 
could be 
potentially responsible 
parties, or 
PRPs, under 
CERCLA. PRPs 
may be 
liable 
 for costs related to contaminated sites, including, but not limited to, site investigation and cleanup costs incurred 
 by the 
government or 
other parties, 
damages to 
natural resources 
and costs 
of certain 
health assessments 
or 
 studies. 
In 
addition, 
CERCLA 
authorizes 
the 
federal 
government 
to 
order 
PRPs 
to 
conduct 
investigation 
and 
 cleanup of releases of hazardous substances at certain contaminated 
sites. 
 CERCLA requires that a list of contaminated sites, referred to as the National Priorities List, be compiled 
by EPA 
 using certain criteria to evaluate the potential relative risk to the public health and the environment from releases 
 or threatened releases of 
hazardous substances. Strict, joint and 
several and retroactive liability may 
be imposed 
 on hazardous 
substance generators 
and facility 
owners and 
operators, regardless 
of fault 
or the 
legality of 
the 
 original disposal activity. The failure to comply with a federal 
government order under CERCLA may result in 
civil 
 penalties, including 
fines and/or 
punitive damages, 
in addition 
to the 
costs incurred 
by the 
federal government 
 due to the party s failure to comply with an order. 
 We could 
face liability 
under CERCLA 
and similar 
state laws 
for properties 
that (1) 
we currently 
own, lease 
or 
 operate, (2) we, 
our predecessors, 
or former 
subsidiaries have 
previously owned, 
leased or 
operated, (3) sites 
 to which 
we, our 
predecessors 
or former 
subsidiaries, 
sent waste 
materials, and 
(4) sites at 
which 
hazardous 
 substances from our facilities operations have otherwise 
come to be located. 
 Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 
 The Mine Act, which was 
amended by the Mine Improvement and 
New Emergency Response Act of 2006, 
or the 
 MINER Act, governs federal oversight of mine safety and 
authorizes the U.S. Department of Labor s Mine Safety 
 and Health 
Administration, 
or MSHA, 
to regulate 
safety 
and health 
conditions for 
employees working 
in mines 
 within 
the 
United 
States, 
and 
to 
enforce 
various 
mandatory 
health 
and 
safety 
requirements. 
The 
Mine 
Act 
 mandates four annual inspections 
of underground coal 
mines, two annual inspections 
of all surface coal 
mines, 
 and permits 
inspections in 
response to 
employee complaints 
of unsafe 
working conditions. 
The statute 
and its 
 regulations also 
mandate miner 
training, mine 
rescue teams 
for all 
underground mines, and 
involvement of 
miners 
 and their 
representatives 
in 
health and 
safety 
activities. 
MSHA has 
also 
promulgated 
regulations 
governing 
a 
 wide 
range 
of 
activities, 
including 
roof 
support, 
ventilation, 
combustible 
materials, 
electrical 
equipment, 
fire 
 protection, 
explosives 
and 
blasting, 
and 
mine 
emergencies. 
MSHA 
has 
the 
statutory 
authority 
to 
issue 
civil 
 penalties for non-compliance, to set the period for abatement 
of violations, and to seek injunctive relief requiring 
 a 
company 
to 
cease 
operations 
until 
certain 
conditions 
are 
corrected. 
The 
MINER 
Act 
requires 
mine 
specific 
 emergency 
response 
plans 
in 
underground 
coal 
mines, 
implemented 
new 
regulations 
regarding 
mine 
rescue 
 teams and sealing 
of abandoned areas, 
requires prompt 
notification of mine 
accidents, and 
imposes enhanced 
 civil and criminal 
penalties for 
violations. Various 
states also 
have enacted 
their own 
new laws 
and regulations 
 addressing many of these 
same subjects. MSHA continues 
to interpret and implement 
various provisions of the 
 MINER Act, along with introducing 
new proposed regulations and standards. 
For example, the second phase 
of 
 MSHA s 
respirable 
coal 
mine 
dust 
rule 
went 
into 
effect 
in 
February 
2016 
and 
requires 
increased 
sampling 

Table of Contents

38 
 frequency and the use of continuous personal dust 
monitors. In August 2016, the third and final phase of 
the rule 
 became effective, reducing the overall respirable dust standard in 
coal mines from 2.0 to 
1.5 milligrams per cubic 
 meter of air. 
In the last several 
years, MSHA has also 
proposed regulations governing 
respirable silica, and 
the 
 exposure of miners to 
underground diesel exhaust fumes, and 
testing, evaluation, and approval of 
electric motor-
 driven mine equipment and accessories. 
MSHA has issued guidance for employers and workers regarding how 
 to mitigate the 
risks of COVID-19 
rather than mandatory 
standards. 
During a September 
29, 2021 stakeholder 
 call, MSHA leadership indicated that it would 
not issue an Emergency Temporary 
Standard requiring COVID-19 
 vaccinations or testing at mine sites. 
 Black Lung (Coal Worker s Pneumoconiosis) 
 The 
Mine 
Act 
amended 
the 
Federal 
Coal 
Mine 
Health 
and 
Safety 
Act 
of 
1969, 
which 
is 
the 
legislation 
that 
 mandates compensation 
for miners 
who were 
totally and 
permanently 
disabled 
by the 
progressive 
respiratory 
 disease caused 
by coal 
workers 
pneumoconiosis, 
or 
black lung. 
Under 
current 
federal law, 
a U.S. 
coal 
mine 
 operator must 
pay federal 
black lung 
benefits and 
medical expenses 
to claimants 
who are 
current employees, 
 and 
to 
claimants 
who 
are 
former 
employees 
who 
last 
worked 
for 
the 
operator 
after 
July 1, 
1973, 
and 
whose 
 claims for benefits are allowed. Coal mine operators must also make payments to a trust fund for 
the payment of 
 benefits and medical expenses 
to claimants who last 
worked in the coal 
industry prior to July 1, 
1973. The trust 
 fund is 
funded by 
an excise 
tax on 
sales of 
U.S. production, 
excluding export 
sales, of 
up to 
 1.21 per 
Mt for 
 deep-mined coal and up to 0.61 per Mt for surface-mined coal, each limited to 4.4 of the gross 
sales price. In 
 2019, 
these 
tax 
rates 
were 
cut 
in 
half 
compared 
to 
the 
pre-2019 
level, 
falling 
to 
 0.61 
per 
Mt 
of 
 underground-mined coal or 0.31 per Mt of surface-mined coal, limited 
to 2 of the sales price. Our total excise 
 taxes paid 
to this 
trust fund 
in 2020 
were 0.9 
million. 
In December 
2019, President 
Trump 
signed 
into law 
a 
 provision that restored the rate 
to its pre-2019 level through 
December 31, 2020. On December 
27, 2020, then-
 President Trump extended the 
trust fund excise 
tax through December 31, 
2021 at the 
pre-2019 rate. Historically, 
 very 
few 
of 
the 
miners 
who 
sought 
federal 
black 
lung 
benefits 
were 
awarded 
these 
benefits; 
however, 
the 
 approval rate has increased following implementation of 
black lung provisions contained in the 
Patient Protection 
 and 
Affordable 
Care 
Act 
of 
2010, 
or 
the 
Affordable 
Care 
Act. 
The 
Affordable 
Care 
Act 
introduced 
significant 
 changes to the 
federal black lung program, 
including an automatic survivor 
benefit paid upon 
the death of 
a miner 
 with 
an 
awarded 
black 
lung 
claim, 
and 
established 
a 
rebuttable 
presumption 
with 
regard 
to 
pneumoconiosis 
 among miners with 15 or 
more years of coal mine 
employment that are totally disabled 
by a respiratory condition. 
 These changes 
could have 
a material 
impact on 
our costs 
expended in 
association with 
the federal 
black lung 
 program. In addition to 
possibly incurring liability 
under federal statutes, 
we may also be 
liable under state 
laws 
 for black 
lung claims. 
See Note 
20

accompanying audited 
Consolidated Financial 
Statements for 
further 
 information of applicable insurance coverage. 
 National Labor Relations Act of 1935 
 The National 
Labor Relations 
Act of 
1935
 , or 
the NLRA, 
governs collective 
bargaining and 
private sector 
labor 
 and management relations. 
While we do not 
have a unionized workforce 
in the United States, 
to the extent that 
 non-supervisory employees decide 
to seek representation 
or engage in 
other protected concerted 
labor activities, 
 the NLRA 
and the 
rules promulgated 
by the 
National 
Labor Relations 
Board, or 
NLRB, set 
the parameters 
for 
 employees and union activity and our 
response. The NLRA applies to both 
unionized and non-union workforces. 
 Any employee 
complaints related 
to the 
pandemic and 
any related 
labor actions, 
if they 
are tied 
to terms 
and 
 conditions of employment 
that affect the 
workforce generally, 
will be governed 
by the NLRA. 
In addition, recent 
 NLRB- 
promulgated 
rules 
regarding 
joint 
employer 
status 
under 
the 
NLRA 
clarified 
the 
basis 
upon 
which 
 contractors and 
vendors, as 
well as 
their employees 
(and the 
unions representing 
them), could 
allege that 
we 
 are jointly and severally liable for any unfair labor practices or bargaining 
obligations of the third-party employer. 
 While the rules 
made the joint 
employer test generally 
more employer-friendly, 
there is always 
the possibility of 
 claims that we are a joint employer with a contractor or 
vendor. 
 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 
2010 
 The United States Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the Affordable Care Act, was enacted in March 
 2010 and included substantial reforms to the U.S. health care system 
intended to increase affordability of health 
 insurance, expand the Medicaid program and support innovative health care delivery methods 
designed to lower 
 costs. The Affordable Care 
Act included a number of provisions 
designed to reduce Medicare 
expenditures and 
 the cost of 
health care generally, to reduce fraud 
and abuse, and 
to provide access to 
increased health coverage. 
 For example, 
the law 
prohibits insurers from 
refusing to 
cover preexisting 
conditions, requires coverage 
for certain 

Table of Contents 
 Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 
2022 
39 
 types 
of care, 
and can 
subject 
certain large 
employers 
to a 
shared responsibility 
payment 
if they 
do not 
offer 
 health coverage 
to their 
full-time employees. 
The Affordable 
Care Act 
also created 
government-run, taxpayer-
 funded health insurance marketplaces (known as Exchanges ). 
 The Affordable Care 
Act impacts the 
coal mining industry s 
costs of providing 
health care benefits 
to its eligible 
 active employees, with 
both short term and 
long term implications. 
It affects health 
care costs by, 
among other 
 things, setting the maximum 
age for covered dependents 
to receive benefits at 
26, requiring certain benefits 
for 
 occupational 
disease 
related 
illnesses, 
and 
eliminating 
lifetime 
dollar 
limits 
on 
essential 
benefits 
per 
covered 
 individual and restrictions 
on annual dollar 
limits on essential 
benefits per covered 
individual. The Affordable Care 
 Act also included 
significant changes 
to the federal 
black lung program, 
including an automatic 
survivor benefit 
 paid upon death of a miner with an awarded black lung claim and the establishment 
of a rebuttable presumption 
 with regard 
to pneumoconiosis 
among miners 
with 15 
or more 
years of 
coal mine 
employment that 
are totally 
 disabled by a respiratory condition. The 
Affordable Care Act also provides lifetime benefits to 
certain dependents 
 who 
survive 
the 
death 
of 
a 
miner, 
if 
the 
miner 
had 
been 
receiving 
the 
benefits 
before 
death. 
For 
additional 
 information, please see above Black Lung (Coal Worker s 
Pneumoconiosis). 
 The 
Affordable 
Care 
Act 
has 
faced 
ongoing 
legal 
challenges, 
including 
litigation 
and 
legislation 
seeking 
to 
 invalidate or 
modify some 
or all 
of the 
law or 
the manner 
in which 
it has 
been implemented. 
For example, 
the 
 Further Consolidated Appropriations 
Act of 2020 repealed 
the Cadillac tax, which 
would have imposed a 
40 
 tax on high-cost 
employer plans starting 
in 2022. The 
constitutionality of the 
individual mandate, 
and the entire 
 Affordable Care 
Act, was 
challenged in 
the Fifth 
Circuit Court 
of Appeals, 
and is 
currently under 
review by 
the 
 Supreme Court. The outcome of these cases is uncertain, and any change they make to the 
Affordable Care Act 
 could have a significant impact on 
the U.S. health care industry and 
employers providing health coverage to their 
 workers. Further, 
the fact 
that implementation 
of certain 
aspects of 
the Affordable 
Care Act 
can be 
affected by 
 Executive Orders and regulations promulgated 
by federal governmental agencies 
that may change when a new 
 President takes office also contributes 
to the uncertainty as 
to how the 
law will affect the 
U.S. health care industry 
 and employers providing health coverage to their workers 
. 
 Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 
 The Safe 
Drinking Water 
Act of 
1974, or 
SDWA, 
is the 
federal law 
that protects 
public drinking 
water supplies 
 throughout the United States. Under the SDWA, 
the EPA sets 
federal health-based standards for drinking water 
 quality and 
implements 
technical 
and financial 
programs 
to ensure 
drinking water 
safety. 
The SDWA 
requires 
 regular monitoring and 
reporting of water 
quality. 
The SDWA 
is applicable to 
public water systems 
that have at 
 least 15 
service connections or 
serve at least 
25 people per 
day for 
60 days of 
the year. Further, SDWA standards 
 apply to water systems 
based on their type 
and size. There are 
four categories: i) 
community water systems, 
ii) 
 non-community water systems, iii) non-transient, 
non-community water systems and iv) 
transient non-community 
 water systems. 
 The 
SDWA 
requires 
the 
EPA 
to 
establish 
National 
Primary 
Drinking 
Water 
Regulations 
for 
contaminants 
that 
 may 
cause 
adverse 
public 
health 
effects. 
These 
regulations 
include 
mandatory 
requirements 
and 
non-
 enforceable health goals. 
The EPA 
sets regulations 
for drinking water 
system concentrations 
of certain organic 
 contaminants, 
inorganic 
contaminants, 
microbiological 
contaminants, 
disinfection 
byproducts, 
residual 
 disinfectant levels, and radionuclide 
levels. The EPA 
also sets filtration requirements 
for drinking water systems 
 that vary depending on the size of the population served 
by the system. 
 The SDWA 
also regulates the 
underground injection of 
fluids into porous 
formations or rocks 
through wells and 
 similar conveyance systems, and regulates the construction, 
operation, permitting and closure of such wells. 
 The SDWA can impact coal mining operations in the United States to the extent that the operations could impact 
 drinking water supplies. 
 National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 
 The 
National 
Historic 
Preservation 
Act 
of 
1966, 
or 
NHPA, 
governs 
the 
preservation 
of 
historical 
properties 
 throughout 
the 
United 
States. 
The 
NHPA 
requires 
the 
Department 
of 
the 
Interior s 
National 
Park 
Service 
to 
 implement 
the 
national 
policy 
to 
preserve 
for 
public 
use 
historic 
sites, 
buildings 
and 
objects 
of 
national 
 significance for the inspiration and benefit of the people of the United States. Alternatively, 
a state may carry out 
 this program 
with 
oversight 
from the 
Department 
of the 
Interior 
if the 
Department 
of the 
Interior 
approves 
the 

Table of Contents 
 Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 
2022 
40 
 state s 
historic 
preservation 
program. 
In 
executing 
this 
policy, 
the 
National 
Park 
Service 
identifies 
National 
 Historic Landmarks 
and places 
them on 
a National 
Register 
of Historic 
Places. 
The NHPA 
requires that 
each 
 federal agency prior to authorizing expenditure of federal funds on a federal or federally assisted undertaking, or 
 prior 
to 
issuing 
a 
federal 
license 
for 
such 
an 
undertaking, 
consider 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
undertaking 
on 
historic 
 resources and to 
provide the Advisory 
Council on Historic 
Preservation with a 
reasonable opportunity to 
comment 
 on the undertaking. 
Accordingly, the NHPA could create an additional level 
of scrutiny on 
a coal mining 
operation, 
 particularly during the permitting process, to the extent 
that a mining operation could come within the scope of 
a 
 historical site. 
The SMCRA 
also provides 
protection for 
historic resources 
that would 
be adversely 
affected by 
 mining operations by requiring the OSM to comply with the NHPA. 
If a property is listed on the National Register 
 of Historic Places, 
SMCRA requires consideration 
of the property s 
historic values 
in determining issuance 
of a 
 surface coal mining permit. 
 Endangered Species Act of 1973 
 The Endangered Species 
Act of 1973, 
or ESA, governs 
the protection of 
endangered species in 
the United States 
 and 
requires 
the 
U.S. 
Department 
of 
the 
Interior s 
Fish 
and 
Wildlife 
Service 
and 
the 
National 
Oceanic 
and 
 Atmospheric 
Administration s 
National 
Marine 
Fisheries 
Service 
to 
formally 
review 
any 
federally 
authorized, 
 funded or 
administered action 
that could 
negatively affect 
endangered or 
threatened species. 
Under the 
ESA, 
 the responsibilities of 
these agencies 
include listing 
and delisting 
species, designating critical 
habitats, developing 
 recovery plans and conducting five-year reviews of listed species. 
 The 
Fish 
and 
Wildlife 
Service 
studies 
projects 
for 
possible 
effects 
to 
endangered 
species 
and 
then 
can 
 recommend alternatives or mitigation measures. 
The OSM and state regulators 
require mining companies to hire 
 a government-approved contractor to conduct surveys for 
potential endangered species, and the 
surveys require 
 approval from state and 
federal biologists who 
provide guidance on 
how to minimize 
mines potential effects 
on 
 endangered 
species. 
Certain 
endangered 
species 
are 
more 
typically 
at 
issue 
under 
the 
ESA 
with 
respect 
to 
 mining, including the long-eared 
bat and Guyandotte crayfish, 
which are found in 
the Central Appalachian region, 
 including 
parts 
of 
Virginia 
and 
West 
Virginia. 
Mitigation 
methods 
can 
cause 
increased 
costs 
to 
coal 
mining 
 operators. Changes in 
listings or requirements 
under these regulations 
could have a 
material adverse effect 
on 
 our costs 
or our 
ability to 
mine some 
of our 
properties 
in accordance 
with 
our current 
mining plans. 
The ESA 
 allows landowners to receive 
a special permit to take 
listed species in some circumstances, 
provided they have 
 developed a Habitat Conservation Plan approved by the 
Fish and Wildlife Service. 
 The U.S. 
Department of 
the Interior 
issued three 
proposed rules 
in July 
2018 aiming 
to streamline 
and update 
 the ESA, and they became effective on September 26, 2019. The rules weaken the protections afforded species 
 listed as 
threatened, and 
make it 
more difficult 
to add 
species to 
the threatened 
and endangered 
species lists 
 and easier to delist 
species. However, 
on June 4, 2021, 
the Fish and Wildlife 
Service and the National 
Oceanic 
 and Atmospheric 
Administration's 
National 
Marine Fisheries 
Service announced 
a plan 
to strengthen 
the ESA 
 and revise or rescind regulations passed under the Trump 
Administration. 
 Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 
 The Migratory Bird 
Treaty Act 
of 1918, or 
MBTA, 
as modified 
by the Migratory 
Bird Treaty 
Reform Act of 
2004, 
 makes it unlawful without 
a waiver to pursue, 
hunt, take, capture, kill 
or sell migratory 
birds, or any part, nest 
or 
 egg of any migratory 
bird. A migratory 
bird species is 
included on the 
list of species 
protected by the 
MBTA 
if it 
 meets one 
or more 
of the 
following 
criteria: 
i) it 
occurs 
in the 
United 
States 
or U.S. 
territories 
as the 
result 
of 
 natural biological or 
ecological processes and 
is currently, or was previously 
listed as, a 
species or part 
of a 
family 
 protected by certain 
international treaties, 
or their amendments, 
entered into by 
the United States 
and Canada, 
 Mexico, Japan or Russia; 
ii) revised taxonomy 
results in it being 
split from a species 
that was previously 
on the 
 list, 
and 
the 
new 
species 
occurs 
in 
the 
United 
States 
or 
U.S. 
territories 
as 
the 
result 
of 
natural 
biological 
or 
 ecological processes; or iii) new evidence exists for its natural occurrence 
in the United States or U.S. territories 
 resulting from 
natural 
distributional 
changes 
and 
the 
species 
occurs 
in 
a 
protected 
family. 
The 
Migratory 
Bird 
 Treaty Reform Act of 2004 
requires the Fish and Wildlife Service to publish 
an informational list of all nonnative, 
 human-introduced 
bird 
species 
to 
which 
MBTA 
does 
not 
apply. 
The 
most 
recent 
list 
of 
all 
nonnative, 
human-
 introduced bird species was published on April 16, 2020. 
 Since coal mining is 
seen as an industry that 
can threaten bird populations, coal operators 
are required to ensure 
 that their 
operations do 
not negatively 
impact migratory 
birds, or 
to take 
mitigation measures. 
Violations of

 MBTA 
are 
either misdemeanor 
or felonies 
punishable 
by a 
fine 
or imprisonment. 
Efforts 
in 
2020 and 
2021 
to 
 narrow the applicability of the MBTA 
were unsuccessful. 
 Regulation of explosives 
 Our surface 
mining operations 
are subject 
to numerous 
regulations relating 
to blasting 
activities, 
including the 
 Federal Safe Explosives 
Act, or SEA. SEA 
applies to all 
users of explosives. 
Knowing or willful violations 
of the 
 SEA may 
result in 
fines, imprisonment, 
or both. 
In addition, 
violations of 
SEA may 
result in 
revocation of 
user 
 permits and seizure or forfeiture of explosive materials. Pursuant to federal regulations, we incur costs 
to design 
 and implement blast schedules and to conduct pre-blast surveys and blast monitoring. In addition, the storage of 
 explosives is 
subject to 
strict regulatory 
requirements established 
by four 
different federal 
regulatory agencies. 
 For example, pursuant to a rule issued by the Department of Homeland Security in 2007, facilities 
in possession 
 of chemicals 
of interest, 
including ammonium nitrate 
at certain 
threshold levels, must 
complete a 
screening review 
 in 
order 
to 
help 
determine 
whether 
there 
is 
a 
high 
level 
of 
security 
risk 
such 
that 
a 
security 
vulnerability 
 assessment and 
site security plan 
will be 
required. The Bureau 
of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives, 
 or 
ATF, 
regulates 
the 
sale, 
possession, 
storage 
and 
transportation 
of 
explosives 
in 
interstate 
commerce. 
In 
 addition to 
ATF regulation, the 
U.S. Department of 
Homeland Security is 
evaluating a 
proposed ammonium nitrate 
 security 
program 
rule. 
In 
2015, 
the 
OSM 
also 
proposed 
a 
rulemaking 
addressing 
nitrogen 
oxide 
clouds 
from 
 blasting; on July 30, 2019, however, 
the OSM withdrew the proposed rulemaking.

 ITEM 1A. 
RISK FACTORS. 
 An investment 
in our 
securities 
is speculative 
and involves 
a number 
of risks. 
We 
believe 
the risks 
described 
 below are the material 
risks that we face. 
However, the 
risks described below may 
not be the only risks 
that we 
 face. 
Additional 
unknown 
risks 
or 
risks 
that 
we 
currently 
consider 
immaterial, 
may 
also 
impair 
our 
business 
 operations. You should carefully consider the specific risk factors discussed below, 
together with the information 
 contained 
in 
this 
Annual 
Report 
on 
Form 
10-K, 
including 
Item 7. 
 Management s 
Discussion 
and 
Analysis 
of 
 Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations and our Consolidated Financial Statements and the 
related notes 
 to those 
statements
 included elsewhere in 
this Annual Report 
on Form 10-K. 
If any of 
the events or 
circumstances 
 described below 
actually occurs, 
our business, financial 
condition or 
results of 
operations could 
suffer, 
and the 
 trading price of our securities could decline significantly. 
 Some of these risks include: 
 
 Concerns about the environmental 
impacts of coal combustion, 
including possible impacts on 
global climate 
 issues, are resulting in increased 
regulation of coal combustion and coal 
mining in many jurisdictions, which 
 could 
significantly 
affect 
demand 
for 
our 
products 
or 
our 
securities 
and 
reduce 
access 
to 
capital 
and 
 insurance; 
 
 Demand for our Met coal is significantly dependent on the steel 
industry
 ; 
 
 We are subject 
to extensive health and 
safety laws and 
regulations that could 
have a material 
adverse effect 
 on our reputation and financial condition and results of operations 
; 
 
 In 
times 
of 
drought 
and/or 
shortage 
of 
available 
water, 
our 
operations 
and 
production, 
particularly 
at 
 Curragh, could 
be negatively 
impacted if 
the regulators 
impose restrictions 
on our 
water offtake 
licenses 
 that are required for water used in the CPPs;
 
 Our business may be adversely affected by the impact on the global economy due to, among other 
events, 
 the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine or other 
significant geopolitical tensions
 ; 
 
 Our business, financial 
condition and results 
of operations may 
be adversely impacted 
by global pandemics, 
 including the COVID-19 pandemic, or other widespread public 
health concerns
 ; 
 
 Our profitability 
depends upon the 
prices we 
receive for 
our coal. 
Prices for 
coal are 
volatile and 
can fluctuate 
 widely based upon a number of factors beyond our control
 ; 
 
 We face increasing competition, which could adversely 
affect profitability;
 
 We may face restricted access to international markets 
in the future
 ; 
 
 If transportation for our 
coal becomes unavailable 
or uneconomic for 
our customers, our 
ability to sell coal 
 could suffer;
 
 Take-or-pay 
arrangements within the coal industry could unfavorably 
affect our profitability
 ; 
 
 A 
decrease 
in 
the 
availability 
or 
increase 
in 
costs 
of 
key 
supplies, 
capital 
equipment, 
commodities 
and 
 purchased components, such as diesel 
fuel, steel, explosives and 
tires could materially and 
adversely affect 
 our financial condition and results of operations
 ; 
 
 Defects 
in 
title 
or 
loss 
of 
any 
leasehold 
interests 
in 
our 
properties 
could 
limit 
our 
ability 
to 
mine 
these 
 properties or result in significant unanticipated costs; 
 
 We may be unable 
to obtain, renew or 
maintain permits necessary 
for our operations, which 
would reduce 
 coal production, cash flows and profitability;
 
 A shortage of skilled labor in the mining industry could pose a risk to achieving improved labor productivity
 ; 
 
 The existence 
(or 
claimed 
existence) 
of 
native 
title 
on 
land within 
our 
Australian 
tenements 
may impose 
 restrictions on the construction of our expansion activities 
and our continued operations;
 
 Risks inherent to mining 
operations could impact the amount 
of coal produced, cause 
delay or suspend coal 
 deliveries, or increase the cost of operating our business;
 
 Our long-term success 
depends upon our 
ability to continue 
discovering, or acquiring 
and developing assets 
 containing, coal reserves that are economically recoverable
 ; 
 
 We 
rely 
on 
estimates 
of 
our 
recoverable 
resources 
and 
reserves, 
which 
are 
complex 
due 
to 
geological 
 characteristics of the properties and the number of assumptions 
made
 ; 

Table of Contents 
 Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31,

 Our profitability could be affected 
adversely by the failure of 
suppliers and/or outside contractors to perform; 
 
 Our 
inability 
to 
replace 
or 
repair 
damaged 
or 
destroyed 
equipment 
or 
facilities 
in 
a 
timely 
manner 
could 
 materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results 
of operations;
 
Our 
ability 
to 
operate 
effectively 
could 
be 
impaired 
if 
we 
lose 
key 
personnel 
or 
fail 
to 
attract 
qualified 
 personnel; 
 
 We may not have adequate insurance coverage for 
some business risks
 ; 
 
 Cybersecurity 
attacks, 
natural 
disasters, 
terrorist 
attacks 
and 
other 
similar 
crises 
or 
disruptions 
may 
 negatively affect our business, financial condition and results 
of operations;
 
 Mining in the CAPP is more complex and 
involves more regulatory constraints than mining in other areas of 
 the U.S., which could affect our mining operations and 
cost structures in these areas; 
 
 The 
loss 
of, 
or 
significant 
reduction 
in, 
purchases 
by 
our 
largest 
customers 
could 
adversely 
affect 
our 
 revenues; 
 
 If a 
substantial number 
of our 
customers fail 
to perform 
under our 
contracts with 
them, our 
revenues and 
 operating profits could suffer; 
 
 If our ability 
to collect payments 
from customers is impaired, 
our revenues and operating 
profits could suffer; 
 
 Our existing 
and future 
indebtedness 
may limit 
cash 
flow available 
to invest 
in the 
ongoing 
needs of 
our 
 businesses, 
which could 
prevent 
us from 
fulfilling 
our 
obligations under 
our senior 
secured 
notes, senior 
 secured asset-based 
revolving credit agreement 
in an initial 
aggregate principal 
amount of 100.0 
million, 
 or 
the 
ABL 
Facility 
(more 
fully 
discussed 
in 
the 
Management 
Discussion 
 
Analysis 
Section 
at 
Item 
7. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources), and other debt, and we may be forced to take other actions to 
satisfy our 
 obligations under our debt, which may not be successful 
; 
 
 We adjust our capital structure from time to time and 
may need to increase our debt leverage, which would 
 make us more sensitive to the effects of economic downturns 
; 
 
 Our business 
may require 
substantial ongoing 
capital 
expenditures, 
and 
we may 
not have 
access 
to the 
 capital required to reach full productive capacity at our mines; 
 
 Risks 
related 
to 
our 
investment 
in 
WICET 
may 
adversely 
affect 
our 
financial 
condition 
and 
results 
of 
 operations; 
 
 Risks related to 
the Supply 
Deed with Stanwell 
may adversely 
affect our financial 
condition and results 
of 
 operations; 
 
 We could be adversely affected if we fail to appropriately 
provide financial assurances for our obligations; 
 
 Mine closures entail substantial 
costs. If we prematurely close 
one or more of 
our mines, our operations and 
 financial performance would likely be affected adversely; 
 
 If 
the 
assumptions 
underlying 
our 
provision 
for 
reclamation 
and 
mine 
closure 
obligations 
prove 
to 
be 
 inaccurate, we could be required to expend greater amounts 
than anticipated; 
 
 We could be negatively affected if we fail to maintain 
satisfactory labor relations; 
 
 Our operations may 
impact the environment 
or cause 
exposure to hazardous 
substances, which could 
result 
 in material liabilities to us; and 
 
 We are subject to extensive 
forms of taxation, which impose 
significant costs on us, 
and future regulations 
 and developments could increase those costs or limit 
our ability to produce coal competitively;

 Environmental and Sustainability Risks 
 Concerns 
about 
the 
environmental 
impacts 
of 
coal 
combustion, 
including 
possible 
impacts 
on 
global 
 climate 
issues, 
are 
resulting 
in 
increased 
regulation 
of 
coal 
combustion 
and 
coal 
mining 
in 
many 
 jurisdictions, 
which 
could 
significantly 
affect 
demand 
for 
our 
products 
or 
our 
securities 
and 
reduce 
 access to capital and insurance. 
 Global concerns 
about climate 
change continues 
to attract 
considerable attention, 
particularly in 
relation to 
the 
 coal industry. Emissions from coal 
consumption, both directly and 
indirectly, and emissions from coal 
mining itself 
 are subject to pending and proposed regulation as part of initiatives to address global climate change. A number 
 of 
countries, 
including 
Australia 
and 
the 
United 
States, 
have 
already 
introduced, 
or 
are 
contemplating 
the 
 introduction of, regulatory responses to GHGs, including the 
extraction and combustion of fossil fuels, to address 
 the impacts of climate change. 
 There are three primary sources of GHGs associated with the coal industry. 
First, the end use of our coal by our 
 customers 
in 
coal-fired 
electricity 
generation, 
coke 
plants, 
and 
steelmaking. 
Second, 
combustion 
of 
fuel 
by 
 equipment used in 
coal production and 
to transport our 
coal to 
our customers. Third, 
coal mining itself 
can release 
 methane, which is considered to 
be a more potent GHG 
than carbon dioxide, directly into 
the atmosphere. These 
 emissions from coal consumption, transportation 
and production are subject to 
pending and proposed regulation, 
 in the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of initiatives 
to address global climate change. 
 As 
a 
result, 
numerous 
proposals 
have 
been 
made 
and 
are 
likely 
to 
continue 
to 
be 
made 
at 
the 
international, 
 national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of GHGs. In November 2014, an 
 agreement was 
announced between 
the United 
States and 
China to 
cut GHGs 
by more 
than 25 
below 2005 
 levels 
by 
2025. 
This 
agreement 
was 
followed 
by 
the 
UNFCCC, 
conference 
in 
Paris, 
France, 
in 
which 
an 
 agreement was 
adopted calling 
for voluntary 
emissions 
reductions contributions, 
or the 
Paris Agreement. 
The 
 Paris Agreement 
was entered 
into force 
on November 
4, 2016 after 
ratification and 
execution by 
more than 55 
 countries, 
which 
account 
for 
at 
least 
55 
of 
global 
GHG 
emissions. 
The 
Paris 
Agreement 
was 
signed 
by 
 representatives from 195 
countries and aims 
to hold back 
the increase in 
global temperatures, increase 
the ability 
 of countries to adapt to 
the adverse impacts of climate change and 
provide channels to finance projects that lead 
 to GHG reductions. 

 On November 20, 2022, the Sharm el-Sheik Conference of Parties 27, or COP27, continued discussions around 
 fossil fuels from 
Glasgow Conference of Parties 
26, which called 
on governments to accelerate 
the dissemination 
 of technologies, 
and 
the adoption 
of 
policies, to 
transition 
toward 
a low-emission 
energy system, 
including 
by 
 accelerating the 
phasedown of 
unabated coal 
power, 
that is 
coal power 
that does 
not include 
the capture 
and 
 storage of carbon dioxide emission and phase-out of inefficient 
fossil fuel subsidies. 
 In 
addition, 
the 
growth 
of 
alternative 
energy 
options, 
such 
as 
renewables 
and 
disruptive 
power 
generation 
 technologies, 
changes 
in 
community 
or 
government 
attitudes 
to 
climate 
change, 
government 
measures 
to 
 subsidize renewable 
energy 
production while 
reducing 
subsidies for 
the fossil 
fuel industry, 
efforts 
to promote 
 divestment of fossil 
fuel equities and 
pressure from lenders 
to limit funding 
to fossil fuel 
companies could result 
 in further development of alternative 
energy industries and broader mainstream acceptance of 
alternative energy 
 options which could 
result in a 
material reduction in 
the demand for 
coal. It could 
also result in 
reduced access 
 to capital to fund our activities as lenders and investors 
divert capital to low emission sectors of the economy. 

 The absence of regulatory certainty, 
global policy inconsistencies and direct regulatory impacts 
(such as carbon 
 taxes or 
other charges) 
each have 
the potential 
to adversely 
affect our 
operations either directly 
or indirectly, 
 through suppliers and 
customers. Collectively, these initiatives and developments could 
result in higher 
electricity 
 costs 
to 
us 
or 
our 
customers 
or 
lower 
the 
demand 
for 
coal 
used 
in 
electricity 
generation, 
which 
could 
in 
turn 
 adversely impact our business. 
 At present, we 
are principally focused on 
Met coal production, 
which is not 
used in connection with 
the production 
 of 
coal-fired 
electricity 
generation. 
The 
market 
for 
our 
coal 
may 
be 
adversely 
impacted 
if 
comprehensive 
 legislation 
or 
regulations 
focusing 
on 
GHG 
emission 
reductions 
are 
adopted, 
particularly 
if 
they 
directly 
or 
 indirectly impact the Met coal industry, 
or if our ability to obtain capital for operations is materially reduced. 

Table of Contents

 We and 
our customers 
may also have 
to invest 
in carbon, 
capture, usage 
and storage 
technologies in 
order to 
 burn thermal 
coal 
and 
comply 
with 
future 
GHG 
emission 
standards. 
The 
potential 
direct 
and 
indirect 
financial 
 impact on us from future laws, regulations, policies and 
technology developments may depend upon the degree 
 to which 
any such 
laws, regulations 
and developments 
force reduced 
reliance on 
coal as 
a fuel 
source. Such 
 developments 
could 
result 
in 
adverse 
impacts 
on 
our 
financial 
condition 
or 
results 
of 
operations. 
See 
Item 1. 
 Business Regulatory Matters Australia and Business Regulatory 
Matters United States. 
 Demand for our Met coal is significantly dependent on 
the steel industry. 
 The majority of 
the coal that 
we produce 
is Met coal 
that is 
sold, directly 
or indirectly, 
to steel 
producers and 
is 
 used in blast furnaces for steel production. Met coal, 
specifically high-quality HCC and low-volatile PCI, 
which is 
 produced at most of our 
assets, has specific physical 
and chemical properties, which are 
necessary for efficient 
 blast furnace operation. 
Therefore, demand for 
our Met coal is 
correlated to demands 
of the steel industry. 
The 
 steel industry s 
demand for 
Met coal 
is influenced 
by a 
number of 
factors, including: 
the cyclical 
nature of 
that 
 industry s business; general economic 
and regulatory conditions and demand 
for steel; and the availability, 
cost 
 and preference for substitutes for steel, such as aluminum, composites and plastics, 
all of which may impact the 
 demand 
for steel 
products. 
Similarly, 
if 
new 
steelmaking 
technologies 
or practices 
are developed 
that 
can 
be 
 substituted 
for 
Met 
coal 
in 
the 
integrated 
steel 
mill 
process, 
then 
demand 
for 
Met 
coal 
would 
be 
expected 
to 
 decrease. 
 Although 
conventional 
blast 
furnace 
technology 
has 
been 
the 
most 
economic 
large-scale 
steel 
production 
 technology for a number of years, there can 
be no assurance that over the longer term, 
competitive technologies 
 not reliant on 
Met coal would 
not emerge, 
which could 
reduce the 
demand and 
price premiums 
for Met coal. 
A 
 significant reduction in 
the demand for 
steel products would 
reduce the demand 
for Met coal, which 
could have 
 a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
and results of operations. 
 Additionally, tariffs imposed by the United States on the import of certain steel products may impact foreign steel 
 producers 
to 
the 
extent 
their 
production 
is 
imported 
into the 
United 
States. 
Future 
tariffs 
could 
further 
reduce 
 imports 
of 
steel 
and 
increase 
U.S. 
Met 
coal 
demand. 
This 
additional 
U.S. 
Met 
coal 
demand 
could 
be 
met 
by 
 reducing exports of Met coal and redirecting that volume 
to domestic consumption. 
 The tariffs 
established by 
the United 
States have 
prompted retaliatory 
tariffs from 
key trading 
partners, notably 
 Europe and China. Any further retaliatory tariffs by these or other countries to these tariffs may limit international 
 trade and adversely impact 
global economic conditions. We cannot ascertain 
the impact, if any, that similar tariffs 
 may have 
on demand 
for our 
Met coal. 
See We 
may face 
restricted 
access 
to international 
markets in 
the 
 future. 
 We are 
subject to 
extensive health 
and safety 
laws and 
regulations that 
could have 
a material 
adverse 
 effect on our reputation and financial condition 
and results of operations. 
 We are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing health and safety at coal 
mines in the United States 
 and Australia. As a 
result of increased stakeholder focus on 
health and safety issues (such 
as black lung disease 
 or 
coal 
workers 
pneumoconiosis), 
there 
is 
a 
risk 
of 
legislation 
and 
regulatory 
change 
that 
may 
increase 
our 
 exposure to claims arising 
out of current or 
former activities or result in 
increased compliance costs (e.g., through 
 requiring improved 
monitoring standards 
or contribution 
to an 
industry-pooled fund). 
Regulatory agencies 
also 
 have the authority, following 
significant health and safety incidents, such as fatalities, to order mining operations 
 to be temporarily suspended or 
the facility be permanently closed. 
For example, on January 12, 2020, 
operations 
 at our 
Curragh mine were 
temporarily suspended after 
a contractor was 
fatally injured during 
a tire 
change activity 
 in 
the 
main 
workshop 
on 
site 
and 
on 
November 
21, 
2021, 
operations 
at 
our 
Curragh 
mine 
were 
temporarily 
 suspended after an employee 
was fatally injured while working 
in the dragline operations. 
If further serious safety 
 incidents were to 
occur at any 
of our mining 
facilities in the 
future, it is 
possible that a 
regulator might impose 
a 
 range 
of 
conditions 
on 
re-opening 
of 
a 
facility, 
including 
requiring 
capital 
expenditures, 
which 
could 
have 
an 
 adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition 
and results of operations.

 Failure to comply with applicable anti-corruption and trade laws, regulations and policies could result in 
 fines and criminal 
penalties, causing 
a material adverse 
effect on our 
business, operating and 
financial 
 prospects or performance. 
 Any 
fraud, 
bribery, 
misrepresentation, 
money 
laundering, 
violations 
of 
applicable 
trade 
sanctions, 
 anti-competitive 
behavior 
or 
other 
misconduct 
by 
our 
employees, 
contractors, 
customers, 
service 
providers, 
 business 
partners 
and 
other 
third parties 
could 
result 
in violations 
of relevant 
laws 
and regulations 
by us 
and 
 subject us or relevant 
individuals to corresponding regulatory 
sanctions or other claims, 
and could also result 
in 
 an event of default under our financing arrangements. These unlawful activities 
and other misconduct may have 
 occurred in 
the past 
and may 
occur in 
the future 
and may 
result in 
civil and 
criminal liability 
under increasingly 
 stringent laws relating 
to fraud, bribery, 
sanctions, competition and 
misconduct or cause 
serious reputational or 
 financial 
harm 
to 
us. 
In 
addition, 
failure 
to 
comply 
with 
environmental, 
health 
or 
safety 
laws 
and 
regulations, 
 privacy laws and regulations, 
U.S. trade sanctions, 
the U.S. Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act and other 
applicable 
 laws or regulations could result in litigation, the assessment of damages, the imposition of penalties, suspension 
 of production 
or distribution, 
costly changes 
to equipment 
or processes 
due to 
required corrective 
action, or 
a 
 cessation or interruption of operations. 
 We 
have 
policies 
and 
procedures 
to 
identify, 
manage 
and 
mitigate 
legal 
risks 
and 
address 
regulatory 
 requirements 
and 
other 
compliance 
obligations. 
However, 
there 
can 
be 
no 
assurance 
that 
such 
policies, 
 procedures and established internal controls 
will adequately protect us against 
fraudulent or corrupt activity and 
 such activity could have an adverse effect on our reputation, 
financial condition and results of operations. 
 In 
times 
of 
drought 
and/or 
shortage 
of 
available 
water, 
our 
operations 
and 
production, 
particularly 
at 
 Curragh, could be negatively impacted if 
the regulators impose restrictions on our 
water offtake licenses 
 that are required for water used in the CPPs. 
 In Queensland, all entitlements to the use, control and 
flow of water are vested in the state and regulated by 
the 
 Water Act 
2000 (Qld). 
Allocations under 
the Water 
Act 2000 (Qld) 
can be managed 
by a water 
supply scheme 
 operator, such as SunWater Ltd. We have purchased the required water allocations for Curragh and 
entered into 
 a suite of 
related channel and pipeline 
infrastructure agreements and river supply 
agreements with SunWater 
Ltd 
 to regulate the supply of water pursuant to these allocations. 
 The amount 
of water 
that is 
available to 
be taken 
under a 
water entitlement 
will vary 
from year 
to year 
and is 
 determined by 
water sharing rules 
of the 
relevant catchment area. 
These rules 
will, for 
example, state 
a procedure 
 for water supply scheme holders to calculate 
the water available to an allocation holder, 
based on available and 
 predicted supply. 
In situations 
of severely 
constrained supply 
(such as during 
a drought), 
supply contracts 
with 
 the scheme operator generally provide for a 
reduced apportionment, with certain uses (e.g., domestic use) being 
 given higher 
priority. 
It is 
possible that 
during times 
of drought 
our water 
offtake entitlements 
in Australia 
could 
 be reduced. If our water 
offtake entitlement was reduced, the operations would have to 
recycle more of the water 
 collected in 
on-site dams 
and former 
mining pits, 
from rainfall 
and dewatering 
activities, for 
use in 
the Curragh 
 CPP. 
This may 
impact our 
ability to 
maintain current 
production levels 
without incurring 
additional costs, 
which 
 could adversely impact our operations and production. 
 Decreases in demand for 
coal-fired electricity and changes 
in thermal coal consumption 
patterns of the 
 United States and Australian electric power generators could 
adversely affect our business. 
 In 
addition 
to 
Met 
coal, 
our 
Australian 
Operations 
and 
U.S. 
Operations 
produce 
some 
thermal 
coal. 
Sales 
of 
 thermal coal represented 34.7 
 of tons sold and 5.3 
 of the total revenues of our Australian 
Operations for the 
 year ended December 31, 2022. 
The majority of the thermal coal 
produced by our Australian Operations 
is sold 
 on a long-term supply 
arrangement to Stanwell. 
Sales of thermal coal 
by our Australian Operations 
to domestic 
 and export buyers are exposed to fluctuations in the global demand for thermal coal or electricity. 
However, coal 
 sold to Stanwell is not directly exposed 
to fluctuations in the global demand for 
electricity or thermal coal. Under 
 the Stanwell supply contract, 
Stanwell can set volumes, and 
pricing is set at 
significantly below-market rates. Our 
 cost of supplying coal to Stanwell has been and may continue to be greater than the price paid by Stanwell. See 
 Risks 
related 
to 
the 
Supply 
Deed 
with 
Stanwell 
may 
adversely 
affect 
our 
financial 
condition 
and 
results 
of 
 operations.

47 
 For the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2022, sales 
of thermal 
coal represented 
4.3 of 
tons sold 
and 3.7 
of the 
 total 
revenues 
our 
U.S. 
Operations 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022. 
As 
such, 
any 
changes 
in 
coal 
 consumption by electric power generators in the United 
States could impact our business over the long term. 
 While 
power 
generation 
from 
thermal 
coal 
remains 
a 
cost-effective 
form 
of 
energy, 
the 
increasing 
focus 
on 
 renewable 
energy 
generation, 
competition 
from 
alternative 
fuel 
sources, 
such 
as 
natural 
gas, 
environmental 
 regulations and 
the consequential 
decline in 
electricity generation 
from fossil 
fuels, is 
expected to 
result in 
the 
 further decline 
of coal-fired 
electricity generation 
due to 
retirement of 
coal-fired 
capacity in 
favor of 
alternative 
 energy. The 
low price of natural gas has resulted 
in some U.S. electric power generators 
increasing natural gas 
 consumption while decreasing coal consumption. 

 Further reductions in 
the demand for 
coal-fired electricity generation and 
the growth of 
alternative energy options, 
 such 
as 
renewables, 
and 
alternate 
power 
generation 
technologies, 
as 
well 
as 
any 
reduction 
in 
demand 
for 
 electricity could materially reduce the demand for thermal coal, which may have a material adverse effect on our 
 financial condition and results of operations. 
 Economic, Competitive and Industry Risks 
 Our 
business 
may 
be 
adversely 
affected 
by 
the 
impact 
on 
the 
global 
economy 
due 
to, 
among 
other 
 events, 
the 
ongoing 
military 
conflict 
between 
Russia 
and 
Ukraine 
or 
other 
significant 
geopolitical 
 tensions. 
 Global 
markets 
are 
experiencing 
volatility 
and 
disruption 
following 
the 
geopolitical 
tensions 
and 
the 
military 
 invasion of Ukraine 
by Russia. This 
military conflict 
has led to, 
and may lead 
to additional, 
sanctions and 
other 
 penalties being 
levied by 
the United 
States, the 
European Union 
and other 
countries against 
Russia, Belarus, 
 the Crimea Region 
of Ukraine and 
the two separatist 
republics in the 
Donetsk and Luhansk 
regions of Ukraine, 
 including expansive bans on imports and exports of 
products to and from Russia. 

 We are unable 
to predict 
the extent and 
duration of the 
ongoing military conflict, 
which could lead 
to further market 
 disruptions, including 
significant volatility 
in commodity 
prices, including 
the coal we 
sell and 
fuel we purchase, 
 instability in the 
financial markets, higher inflation, 
supply chain interruptions, political and 
social instability as well 
 as an 
increase in 
cyberattacks and 
espionage. Further, sanctions, and 
any other 
measures, as 
well as 
the existing 
 and potential 
further responses from 
Russia or 
other countries 
to such 
sanctions, could adversely 
affect the global 
 economy and financial markets, which 
could in turn have 
an adverse impact on 
our financial condition and 
results 
 of operations or heighten other risks described in this 
Item 1A, Risk Factors .
 Our 
business, 
financial 
condition 
and 
results 
of 
operations 
may 
be 
adversely 
impacted 
by 
global 
 pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or other 
widespread public health concerns. 
 Global pandemics, including the COVID-19 
pandemic, or other widespread public 
health concerns could have an 
 adverse effect on our business, financial condition 
and results of operations. 

 International, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities mandates in response to global 
 pandemics could require forced 
shutdowns of our mines 
and other facilities 
in Australia and the 
U.S. for extended 
 periods, restrict movement and the implementation of social distancing 
protocols and restrict travelling overseas 
 or 
across 
borders 
(including 
interstate), 
affecting 
a 
number 
of 
our 
normal 
business 
practices 
and 
operations. 
 These 
restrictions 
could 
cause 
disruptions 
to 
mining 
operations, 
manufacturing 
operations 
and 
supply 
chains 
 around the world. 

 The 
extent and duration 
of the impact 
that global pandemics, including 
the COVID-19 pandemic, 
and other public 
 health concerns could have in our business and results of operations will depend on numerous factors out of our 
 control that we may 
not be able to 
accurately predict and 
could also heighten 
other risks described 
in this Item 
 1A. Risk Factors section, which could have a material adverse impact in our business and results of operations. 
 Our 
profitability 
depends 
upon 
the 
prices we 
receive 
for our 
coal. 
Prices 
for 
coal are 
volatile 
and 
can 
 fluctuate widely based upon a number of factors beyond 
our control. 
 We generate 
revenue from 
the sale 
of coal 
and our 
financial 
results 
are materially 
impacted by 
the prices 
we 
 receive. 
Prices 
and 
quantities 
under 
Met 
coal 
sales 
contracts 
in 
North 
America 
are 
generally 
based 
on 
 expectations 
of 
the 
next 
year s 
coal 
prices 
at 
the 
time 
the 
contract 
is 
entered 
into, 
renewed, 
extended 
or 
 re-opened. Pricing in the global seaborne market is typically set 
on a rolling quarterly average benchmark price. 

Table of Contents 
 Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 
2022 
48 
 Sales by our 
U.S. Operations to the 
export market are 
typically priced with reference 
to a benchmark 
index. Sales 
 by our Australian Operations have typically been contracted on an annual basis and are priced with reference 
to 
 benchmark indices or bilaterally 
negotiated term prices 
and spot indices. As 
a result, a significant 
portion of our 
 revenue is 
exposed to 
movements in 
coal prices 
and any 
weakening in 
Met or 
thermal coal 
prices would 
have 
 an adverse impact on our financial condition and results 
of operations. 
 The expectation of future prices for coal depends upon many factors beyond our 
control, including the following: 
 
the current market price of coal; 
 
overall domestic and global economic conditions, 
including inflationary conditions and the supply 
of and 
 demand for domestic and foreign coal, coke and steel; 
 
the consumption pattern of industrial consumers, electricity generators 
and residential users; 
 
weather 
conditions 
in 
our 
markets 
that 
affect 
the 
ability 
to 
produce 
Met 
coal 
or 
affect 
the 
demand 
for 
 thermal coal; 
 
competition from other coal suppliers; 
 
technological advances affecting the steel production 
process and/or energy consumption; 
 
the costs, availability and capacity of transportation infrastructure; 
and 
 
the impact 
of domestic 
and foreign 
governmental policy, 
laws and 
regulations, including 
the imposition 
 of tariffs, environmental 
and climate change 
regulations and 
other regulations 
affecting the 
coal mining 
 industry, 
including regulations and measures introduced in response 
to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Met 
coal 
has 
been 
a 
volatile 
commodity 
over 
the 
past 
ten 
years. 
Recently, 
in 
the 
second 
quarter 
of 
2022, 
 seaborne prices reached record 
levels with both the Australian 
and U.S. Met coal 
price indices exceeding 600 
 per Mt, largely as result of 
supply concerns in key Met coal 
markets and continued trade flow 
disruptions due to 
 sanctions imposed 
on Russia s 
coal imports 
following Russian 
invasion of 
Ukraine. The 
demand and 
supply in 
 the Met 
coal industry 
changes from 
time to 
time. There 
are no 
assurances that 
oversupply will 
not occur, 
that 
 demand will 
not decrease 
or that 
overcapacity will 
not occur, 
which could 
cause declines 
in the 
prices of 
coal, 
 which could have a material adverse effect on 
our financial condition and results of operations. 
 In addition, coal prices are highly 
dependent on the outlook for coal consumption in 
large Asian economies, such 
 as China, India, South Korea and Japan, 
as well as any changes in government 
policy regarding coal or energy 
 in those 
countries. 
Seaborne 
Met coal 
import 
demand 
can also 
be significantly 
impacted by 
the 
availability 
of 
 local coal production, particularly in the leading Met coal import countries of China and India, among others, and 
 the 
competitiveness 
of 
seaborne 
Met 
coal 
supply, 
including 
from 
the 
leading 
Met 
coal 
exporting 
countries 
of 
 Australia, the United States, Russia, Canada and Mongolia, 
among others. 

 We face increasing competition, which could adversely 
affect profitability. 
 Competition 
in 
the 
coal 
industry 
is 
based 
on 
many 
factors, 
including, 
among 
others, 
world 
supply, 
price, 
 production 
capacity, 
coal 
quality 
and 
characteristics, 
transportation 
capability 
and 
costs, 
blending 
capability, 
 brand name 
and diversified 
operations. We 
are subject 
to competition 
from Met 
coal producers 
from Australia, 
 the United States, Russia, Canada, Mongolia and other Met coal producing countries. 
Should those competitors 
 obtain a 
competitive advantage in comparison 
to us (whether 
by way of 
an increase in 
production capacity, higher 
 realized 
prices, 
lower 
operating 
costs, 
export/import 
tariffs, 
being 
comparatively 
less 
impacted 
as 
a 
result 
of 
 global pandemics or otherwise), 
such competitive advantage 
may have an adverse 
impact on our ability 
to sell, 
 or the 
prices at 
which we 
are able 
to sell 
coal 
products. 
In addition, 
some of 
our competitors 
may have 
more 
 production capacity as well as greater financial, marketing, distribution and other resources than we do and may 
 be subject to less stringent environmental and other regulations 
than we are. 

Table of Contents 
 Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31,

49 
 The consolidation 
of the global 
Met coal industry 
in recent years 
has contributed 
to increased competition, 
and 
 our competitive 
position may 
be adversely 
impacted by 
further consolidation 
among 
market participants 
or by 
 further 
competitors 
entering 
into 
and 
exiting 
bankruptcy 
proceedings 
under 
a 
lower 
cost 
structure. 
Similarly, 
 potential 
changes 
to 
international 
trade 
agreements, 
trade 
concessions 
or 
other 
political 
and 
economic 
 arrangements may benefit 
coal producers operating 
in countries 
other than the 
United States and 
Australia. Other 
 coal producers may also develop or acquire new projects to increase their coal production, which may adversely 
 impact our competitiveness. Some 
of our global competitors 
have significantly greater financial 
resources, such 
 that increases in their coal production may affect domestic and foreign Met coal supply into the seaborne market 
 and associated prices and impact our ability to retain or 
attract Met coal customers. In addition, our ability to ship 
 our Met coal to non-U.S. 
and non-Australian customers 
depends on port and transportation 
capacity. 
Increased 
 competition 
within 
the 
Met 
coal 
industry 
for 
international 
sales 
could 
result 
in 
us 
not 
being 
able 
to 
obtain 
 throughput capacity at port facilities, as well as transport capacity, and could cause the rates for such services to 
 increase to a point where it is not economically feasible to export 
our Met coal. 
 Increased competition, or a 
failure to compete effectively, 
in the markets in 
which we participate 
may result in a 
 loss of market share and could adversely affect our financial 
condition and results of operations. 
 We may face restricted access to international markets 
in the future. 
 Access to 
international markets 
may be 
subject to 
ongoing interruptions 
and trade 
barriers due 
to policies 
and 
 tariffs of individual 
countries, and the 
actions of certain 
interest groups to 
restrict the 
import or export 
of certain 
 commodities. For 
example, the 
current imposition 
of tariffs 
and import 
quota restrictions 
by China 
on U.S. 
and 
 Australian coal 
imports respectively, 
including the 
ongoing suspension 
of imports 
of Australian 
coal into 
China, 
 may in 
the future have 
a negative impact 
on our profitability. The timing 
of any change 
to these measures 
remains 
 uncertain, and there can be no guarantee that other tariffs, import quota restrictions, bans or other trade barriers 
 will not be imposed (whether as a result of geopolitical tensions or for other 
reasons), either by China or in other 
 markets for our products. We 
may or may not be able to 
access alternate markets for our 
coal should additional 
 interruptions 
and 
trade 
barriers 
occur 
in 
the 
future. 
An 
inability 
for 
Met 
coal 
suppliers 
to 
access 
international 
 markets, including China, would likely 
result in an oversupply of Met coal 
and may result in a decrease in 
prices 
 or the curtailment of production, which could 
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and 
results 
 of operations. 
 If transportation 
for our 
coal becomes 
unavailable or 
uneconomic for 
our customers, 
our ability 
to sell 
 coal could suffer. 
 Our mining operations produce coal, which is transported to customers by a combination of road, rail, barge and 
 ship. The 
delivery of 
coal produced 
by our 
mining operations 
is subject 
to potential 
disruption and 
competition 
 from other network users, 
which may affect our 
ability to deliver coal 
to our customers and 
may have an impact 
 on productivity and profitability. 
Such disruptions to transportation services may include, 
among others: 
 
disruptions due to weather-related problems; 
 
key equipment or infrastructure failures; 
 
industrial action; 
 
rail or port capacity congestion or constraints; 
 
commercial disputes; 
 
failure to 
obtain consents 
from third 
parties for 
access to 
rail or 
land, or 
access being 
removed 
or not 
 granted by regulatory authorities; 
 
changes in applicable regulations; 
 
failure or delay in the construction of new rail or port capacity; 
and 
 
terrorist attacks, natural disasters, the 
impact from global pandemics, including 
the COVID-19 pandemic, 
 or other events.

 Any 
such 
disruptions, 
or 
any 
deterioration 
in 
the 
reliability 
of 
services 
provided 
by 
our 
transportation 
service 
 providers, could 
impair our 
ability to 
supply coal 
to our 
customers, result 
in decreased 
shipments and 
revenue 
 and adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Typically, 
we sell coal at the mine 
gate and/or loaded into vessels at 
the port. While ordinarily our coal 
customers 
 arrange 
and 
pay 
for 
transportation 
of 
coal 
from 
the 
mine 
or 
port 
to 
the 
point 
of 
use, 
we 
have 
entered 
into 
 arrangements 
with 
third 
parties 
to 
gain 
access 
to 
transportation 
infrastructure 
and 
services 
where 
required, 
 including road transport organizations, rail carriers and port owners. Where coal is exported or sold other than at 
 the mine gate, the costs associated with these arrangements represent a significant portion of both the total cost 
 of supplying 
coal to 
customers and 
of our 
production costs. 
As a 
result, the 
cost of 
transportation is 
not only 
a 
 key factor in our cost base, but also in the purchasing decision of customers. Transportation 
costs may increase 
 and 
we 
may 
not 
be 
able 
to 
pass 
on 
the 
full 
extent 
of 
cost 
increases 
to 
our 
customers. 
For 
example, 
where 
 transportation 
costs 
are 
connected 
to 
market 
demand, 
costs 
may 
increase 
if 
usage 
by 
us 
and 
other 
market 
 participants increases. Significant 
increases in transport 
costs due to factors 
such as fluctuations in 
the price of 
 diesel fuel, electricity and demurrage or environmental requirements could make our coal less competitive when 
 compared to coal produced from other regions and countries. As the transportation capacity secured 
by our port 
 and rail agreements is based 
on assumed production volumes, we may 
also have excess transportation capacity 
 (which, in the 
case of take-or-pay 
agreements, we may 
have to pay 
for even if 
unused) if our 
actual production 
 volumes are lower 
than our estimated production 
volumes. Conversely, we may not have sufficient transportation 
 capacity if our actual production volumes 
exceed our estimated production volumes, if 
we are unable to transport 
 the 
full 
capacity 
due 
to 
contractual 
limitations 
or 
if 
any 
deterioration 
in 
our 
relationship 
with 
brokers 
and 
 intermediaries results 
in a 
reduction in 
the proportion 
of coal 
purchased FOR 
from our 
U.S. Operations 
(and a 
 corresponding increase in the proportion of coal purchased FOB). 
 Take-or-pay arrangements within the 
coal industry could unfavorably affect our profitability. 
 Our 
Australian 
Operations 
generally 
contract 
port 
and 
rail 
capacity 
via 
long-term 
take-or-pay 
contracts 
for 
 transport, currently with 
Aurizon Operations 
Limited and Pacific 
National Pty Ltd, 
to and export 
from the Port 
of 
 Gladstone via two main port terminals, RGTCT and WICET. 
At our U.S. Operations, we also have a take-or-pay 
 agreement in 
connection 
with the 
Kinder Morgan 
Pier IX 
Terminal 
in Hampton 
Roads, Virginia. 
We may 
enter 
 into other take-or-pay arrangements in the future. 
 Where we have entered into take-or-pay contracts, we will generally be required to pay for our 
contracted port or 
 rail capacity, even 
if it 
is not 
utilized by 
us or 
other shippers. Although 
the majority 
of our 
take-or-pay arrangements 
 provide security over minimum port and 
rail infrastructure availability, 
unused port or rail capacity can 
arise as a 
 result 
of 
varying 
unforeseen 
circumstances, 
including 
insufficient 
production 
from 
a 
given 
mine, 
a 
mismatch 
 between the timing of 
required port and rail 
capacity for a mine, 
or an inability to 
transfer the used capacity 
due 
 to contractual limitations, such as 
required consent of the provider of 
the port or rail services, 
or because the coal 
 must emanate from specified 
source mines or 
be loaded onto trains 
at specified load 
points. Paying for 
unused 
 transport 
capacity 
could 
materially 
and 
adversely 
affect 
our 
cost 
structures 
and 
financial 
performance. 
See 
 Item 7. Management s Discussion and 
Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of 
Operations for a 
summary 
 of our expected future obligations under take-or-pay arrangements 
as of December 31, 2022. 
 A decrease in 
the availability 
or increase 
in costs of 
key supplies, capital 
equipment, commodities 
and 
 purchased components, 
such as 
diesel fuel, 
steel, explosives 
and tires 
could materially 
and adversely 
 affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our mining operations require a reliable 
supply of large quantities of fuel, 
explosives, tires, steel-related products 
 (including 
roof 
control 
materials), 
lubricants 
and 
electricity. 
The 
prices 
we 
pay 
for 
commodities 
are 
strongly 
 impacted by the global 
market. In situations where 
we have chosen to 
concentrate a large portion 
of purchases 
 with one supplier, it has been to take 
advantage of cost savings from larger volumes of 
purchases and to support 
 security of supply. 
If the cost 
of any of 
these key supplies 
or commodities increased 
significantly, 
or if a 
source 
 for these supplies or mining equipment was unavailable to meet our replacement demands, including as a result 
 of the COVID-19 pandemic or 
otherwise, our profitability could be reduced or 
we could experience a delay or 
halt 
 in our production.

 Prices 
for equipment, 
materials, 
supplies 
and employee 
labor 
contractor 
services 
increased during 
2022, 
and 
 could 
continue 
to 
increase 
in 
2023 
and 
beyond. 
Long-term 
inflationary 
pressures 
may 
result 
in 
such 
prices 
 continuing to 
increase 
more quickly 
than expected. 
Inflation increases 
costs for 
materials, labor 
and services, 
 and we 
may be 
unable to 
secure these 
resources on 
economically acceptable 
terms or 
offset such 
costs with 
 increased revenues, operating efficiencies, 
or cost savings, which may adversely 
impact our financial condition, 
 results of operations, liquidity, 
and cash flows. 
 Our coal production and production costs can be materially and adversely impacted by unexpected shortages or 
 increases in the costs of consumables, spare parts, 
plant and equipment. For example, operation 
of the thermal 
 dryer located at 
the CPP at 
Buchanan is dependent 
upon the delivery 
of natural gas 
and there is 
currently only 
 one 
natural 
gas 
supplier 
in 
the 
area, 
an 
affiliate 
of 
CONSOL 
Energy. 
Although 
we 
have 
entered 
into 
a 
gas 
 purchase agreement with CONSOL Energy, 
this agreement can be terminated by CONSOL 
Energy on 30 days 
 notice and any delay 
or inability to negotiate 
a replacement agreement 
would impact our costs 
of production as 
 we would need to change our processing method at Buchanan.
 Defects in 
title or 
loss of 
any leasehold 
interests in 
our properties 
could limit 
our ability 
to mine 
these 
 properties or result in significant unanticipated costs. 
 In Queensland, 
where all 
of our 
Australian Operations 
are carried 
out, exploring 
or mining 
for coal 
is unlawful 
 without a tenement granted by the Queensland 
government. The grant and renewal of tenements 
are subject to 
 a regulatory regime and each 
tenement is subject to certain 
conditions. There is no 
certainty that an application 
 for the grant of a 
new tenement or renewal 
of one of the 
existing Tenements 
at Curragh will be 
granted at all or 
 on 
satisfactory 
terms 
or 
within 
expected 
timeframes. 
Further, 
the 
conditions 
attached 
to 
the 
Tenements 
may 
 change at the time they are renewed. There is 
a risk that we may lose title to 
any of our granted Tenements if we 
 fail to comply with 
the Tenement 
conditions and other 
applicable legislative requirements 
(including payment of 
 State 
royalties) 
or 
if 
the 
land 
that 
is 
subject 
to 
the 
title 
is 
required 
for 
public 
purposes. 
The 
Tenements 
have 
 expiration dates ranging from 
May 31, 2023 to July 
31, 2044 and, where renewal 
is required, there is a 
risk that 
 the Queensland government may change the terms and conditions 
of such Tenement 
upon renewal. 
 In 
the 
United 
States, 
title 
to 
a 
leased 
property 
and 
mineral 
rights 
is 
generally 
secured 
prior 
to 
permitting 
and 
 developing a property. In some cases, 
we rely on title information or representations and warranties provided by 
 our lessors, grantors 
or other third 
parties. Our right 
to mine some 
of our reserves 
may be adversely 
affected if 
 defects in 
title or 
boundaries 
exist or 
if a 
lease expires. 
Any challenge 
to our 
title or 
leasehold interests 
could 
 delay the exploration and development of the property and could ultimately result in the loss of some 
or all of our 
 interest in the property and, accordingly, require us to reduce our estimated coal 
reserves. In addition, if we mine 
 on property that we do not 
own or lease, we could incur 
civil damages or liability for 
such mining and be subject 
 to conversion, negligence, 
trespass, regulatory sanction 
and penalties. Some 
leases have minimum 
production 
 requirements or require us 
to commence mining operations in 
a specified term to 
retain the lease. Failure 
to meet 
 those requirements 
could result 
in losses of 
prepaid royalties 
and, in some 
rare cases, 
could result 
in a loss 
of 
 the lease itself. 
 In 
the 
United 
States, 
we 
predominantly 
access 
our 
mining 
properties 
through 
leases 
with 
a 
range 
of 
private 
 landholders. 
If 
a 
default 
under 
a 
lease 
for 
properties 
on 
which 
we 
have 
mining 
operations 
resulted 
in 
the 
 termination of the 
applicable lease, 
we may have 
to suspend 
mining or significantly 
alter the sequence 
of such 
 mining operations, which may adversely affect our 
future coal production and future revenues. 
 To 
obtain 
leases 
or 
mining 
contracts 
to 
conduct 
our 
U.S. 
Operations 
on 
properties 
where 
defects 
exist 
or 
to 
 negotiate extensions or amendments 
to existing leases, we 
may in the future have 
to incur unanticipated costs. 
 In addition, we may 
not be able 
to successfully negotiate new 
leases or mining 
contracts for properties containing 
 additional 
reserves 
or 
maintain 
our 
leasehold 
interests 
in 
properties 
where 
we 
have 
not 
commenced 
mining 
 operations during the term of the lease. 
 A defect in our title or the loss of any lease or Tenement 
upon expiration of its term, upon a default or otherwise, 
 could adversely affect our ability to mine the 
associated reserves or process the coal we mine.

 We may 
be unable 
to obtain, 
renew or 
maintain permits necessary 
for our 
operations, which 
would reduce 
 coal production, cash flows and profitability. 
 Our performance 
and 
operations 
depend 
on, among 
other things, 
being able 
to 
obtain on 
a timely 
basis, 
and 
 maintain, 
all 
necessary 
regulatory 
approvals, 
including 
any 
approvals 
arising 
under 
applicable 
mining 
laws, 
 environmental regulations and 
other laws, for our 
current operations, expansion 
and growth projects. Examples 
 of regulatory 
approvals that 
we must 
obtain and 
maintain include 
mine development 
approvals, environmental 
 permits and, in 
Australia, tenure and approvals 
relating to native 
title and indigenous cultural 
heritage. In addition, 
 our operations depend 
on our ability 
to obtain and 
maintain consents from private 
land owners and 
good relations 
 with local communities. 
 The requirement 
to obtain 
and maintain 
approvals and 
address potential 
and actual 
issues for 
former, 
existing 
 and future 
mining 
projects 
is common 
to all 
companies 
in the 
coal sector. 
However, 
there is 
no assurance 
or 
 guarantee that we 
will obtain, 
secure, or be 
able to maintain 
any or all 
of the required 
consents, approvals 
and 
 rights necessary to maintain our current 
production profile from our existing 
operations or to develop our 
growth 
 projects 
in a 
manner 
which 
will result 
in 
profitable 
mining 
operations 
and/or 
achieve 
our long-term 
production 
 targets. The permitting rules, and 
the interpretations of these rules, 
are complex, change frequently and 
are often 
 subject to the interpretation of the regulators that 
enforce them, all of which may make compliance more 
difficult 
 or impractical, 
and may 
possibly preclude 
the continuance 
of ongoing 
operations or 
the development 
of future 
 mining operations. Certain 
laws, such as 
the SMCRA, require 
that certain environmental 
standards be met 
before 
 a 
permit 
is 
issued. 
The 
public, 
including 
non-governmental 
organizations, 
anti-mining 
groups 
and 
individuals, 
 have certain 
statutory 
rights 
to comment 
upon and 
submit 
objections 
to requested 
permits and 
environmental 
 impact statements. 
These comments 
are prepared 
in connection 
with applicable 
regulatory processes, 
and the 
 public may otherwise engage 
in the permitting 
process, including bringing 
lawsuits to challenge the 
issuance of 
 permits, the 
validity or 
adequacy of environmental 
impact statements or 
performance of mining 
activities. In 
states 
 where we operate, applicable 
laws and regulations 
also provide that 
a mining permit 
or modification can, 
under 
 certain 
circumstances, 
be 
delayed, 
refused 
or 
revoked 
if 
we 
or 
any 
entity 
that 
owns 
or 
controls 
or 
is 
under 
 common 
ownership 
or 
control 
with 
us 
have 
unabated 
permit 
violations 
or 
have 
been 
the 
subject 
of 
permit 
or 
 reclamation bond revocation or suspension. Thus, past or ongoing violations of federal and state 
mining laws by 
 us or such entity could provide a basis 
to revoke existing permits and to deny 
the issuance of additional permits 
 or modification 
or amendment 
of existing 
permits. In 
recent years, 
the 
permitting 
required for 
coal mining 
has 
 been the subject of increasingly stringent regulatory and 
administrative requirements and extensive activism and 
 litigation 
by 
environmental 
groups. 
If 
this 
trend 
continues, 
it 
could 
materially 
and 
adversely 
affect 
our 
mining 
 operations, development 
and expansion 
and cost 
structures, the 
transport of 
coal and 
our customers 
ability to 
 use coal produced 
by our mines, 
which, in turn, 
could have 
a material 
adverse effect 
on our financial 
condition 
 and results of operation. 
 In particular, 
certain of 
our activities 
require a 
dredge and 
fill permit 
from the 
USACE under 
Section 404 of 
the 
 CWA. In 
recent years, the 
Section 404 permitting 
process has 
been subject to 
increasingly stringent 
regulatory 
 and administrative 
requirements 
and a 
series of 
court challenges, 
which have 
resulted in 
increased costs 
and 
 delays in the permitting process. In addition, in 2015, the EPA and the USACE issued the CWR, under the CWA 
 that would 
further expand 
the circumstances 
when a 
Section 404 permit 
is needed. 
The CWR 
is the 
subject of 
 extensive ongoing litigation and 
administrative proceedings, as 
a result of which the 
CWR has been enjoined 
in 
 certain 
states 
(including 
West 
Virginia) 
and 
reinstated 
in 
others 
(including 
Virginia 
and 
Pennsylvania), 
and 
its 
 current and future impact on our operations are the subject of significant uncertainty. On April 21, 2020, the EPA 
 and the 
USACE 
published 
the NWPR, 
replacing 
the 
CWR. The 
NWPR 
revises 
the definition 
of 
waters 
of 
the 
 United States 
and replaces 
the CWR. 
The NWPR 
shrinks the 
agencies jurisdiction, 
particularly as 
it relates 
to 
 tributaries and adjacent waters, such 
as wetlands, that were previously 
covered by the definition under 
the CWR. 
 The NWPR 
went into 
effect 
on June 
22, 2020. 
States and 
environmental 
groups have 
filed challenges 
to the 
 NWPR in various federal 
district courts. 
We cannot at this time 
predict how this rule 
will be enforced in 
the future. 
 Additionally, we may rely on nationwide permits 
under the CWA Section 404 program for 
some of our operations. 
 These nationwide 
permits 
are issued 
every 
five years, 
and the 
2017 
nationwide 
permit 
program 
was 
recently 
 reissued in 
January 
2017. 
If we 
are unable 
to use 
the nationwide 
permits 
and require 
an individual 
permit 
for 
 certain work, that could delay operations.

 If we 
are unable 
to obtain 
and maintain 
the approvals, 
consents and 
rights required 
for our 
current and 
future 
 operations, or 
if we 
obtain 
approvals subject 
to conditions 
or limitations, 
the 
economic 
viability of 
the relevant 
 projects may be 
adversely affected, 
which may in 
turn result in 
the value of 
the relevant assets 
being impaired, 
 which could have a material adverse effect on 
our financial condition and results of operations. 
 A 
shortage 
of 
skilled 
labor 
in 
the 
mining 
industry 
could 
pose 
a 
risk 
to 
achieving 
improved 
labor 
 productivity. 
 Efficient coal mining using modern techniques and equipment requires skilled laborers, preferably with at least a 
 year of experience and proficiency in multiple 
mining tasks. Any reduced availability or future 
shortage of skilled 
 labor 
in 
the 
Australian 
and 
U.S. 
mining 
industries 
(including, 
but 
not 
limited 
to, 
ongoing 
labor 
shortage 
at 
the 
 Logan operations which has impacted production at our U.S. Operations and as 
a result of the impact of COVID-
 19 pandemic) 
could result 
in our 
having 
insufficient 
personnel 
to operate 
our business, 
or expand 
production, 
 particularly in the event there 
is an increase in the 
demand for our coal, which 
could adversely affect our financial 
 condition and results of operations. 
 The existence (or claimed existence) of native 
title on land within our Australian tenements 
may impose 
 restrictions on the construction of our expansion activities 
and our continued operations. 
 In Australia, 
mineral exploration 
and mining 
tenure 
(and 
many other 
forms 
of tenure 
or interests 
in 
land) 
may 
 cover land that is subject to 
a claim for native title or 
land where native title has already been 
determined to exist. 
 Native title is the communal, group or individual rights and interests of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people 
 in relation to their traditional land or waters. The existence 
of native title in Australia is recognized and protected 
 in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Native 
Title 
Act 
1993 
(Cth), 
or 
the 
Native 
Title 
Act, 
and 
legislation 
in 
each 
State 
and 
 Territory. 
The common 
law of Australia 
recognizes a 
form of 
native title that, 
in circumstances 
where it has 
not 
 been extinguished, reflects the entitlement of 
the appropriate traditional owners to their 
lands, in accordance with 
 their traditional law and custom. 
 If native title 
is either determined 
to exist or 
there are 
registered, but 
undetermined, native 
title claims 
over any 
 part of the tenements 
and native title 
has not otherwise 
been extinguished with 
respect to that 
part, we may 
be 
 required to negotiate with, and pay compensation to, the native title holders for impairment, loss 
or diminution or 
 other effect of the proposed activities 
on their native title rights and 
interests. Compensation obligations may also 
 arise pursuant 
to agreements 
with native 
title claimants 
or native 
title holders 
in relation 
to any 
tenements 
we 
 acquire. 
The 
existence 
of 
native 
title 
or 
a 
registered 
native 
title 
claim 
may 
preclude 
or 
delay 
the 
granting 
of 
 exploration and mining tenements pending resolution of the statutory procedures 
imposed by the Native Title Act 
 and considerable expenses may be incurred in negotiating 
and resolving native title issues. 
 The risk of 
unforeseen native 
title claims also 
could affect 
existing operations 
as well as 
development projects. 
 Although native title will not prevent the exercise of any validly granted rights and interests under our tenements, 
 the Native Title 
Act and applicable 
State and Commonwealth 
legislation, together 
with the recognition 
of native 
 title at common 
law, 
may impact 
the continued 
operations under 
our tenements, 
development projects 
and the 
 construction of our expansion activities and/or give rise to 
liability for compensation. 
 The Aboriginal Cultural 
Heritage Act 2003 
(Qld) and the 
Torres 
Strait Islander 
Cultural Heritage 
Act 2003 (Qld) 
 provide 
a 
framework 
for 
the 
protection 
of 
Aboriginal 
and 
Torres 
Strait 
Islander 
cultural 
heritage. 
The 
main 
 mechanism through 
which 
each act 
operates is 
a list 
of places 
and artifacts 
of heritage 
significance. The 
acts 
 also create 
offenses 
such 
as breach 
of the 
cultural 
heritage duty 
of care. 
This duty 
of care 
requires a 
person 
 carrying 
out 
an 
activity 
to 
take 
all reasonable 
and 
practicable 
measures 
to 
ensure 
the 
activity 
does 
not 
harm 
 Aboriginal cultural heritage. 
 In addition, it may also be necessary for 
us to enter into separate arrangements with the 
traditional owners of the 
 sites. 
This 
could 
be 
costly 
for 
us 
and 
potentially 
cause 
delays 
in 
our 
continued 
operational 
and 
expansion 
 activities. 
 Although 
the 
failure 
to 
resolve 
any 
issues 
associated 
with 
sites 
of 
indigenous 
heritage 
significance 
could 
 adversely impact our expansion activities and our continuing operations, there are no 
such current or anticipated 
 issues.

 Operational and Technology 
Risks 
 Risks inherent to mining operations could impact the amount of coal produced, 
cause delay or suspend 
 coal deliveries, or increase the cost of operating our 
business. 
 Our 
mining 
operations, 
including 
exploration, 
development, 
preparation, 
product 
handling 
and 
accessing 
 transport infrastructure, 
may be affected 
by various operational 
difficulties that 
could impact the 
amount of coal 
 produced at our coal mines, cause 
delay or suspend coal deliveries, or increase 
the cost of mining for a varying 
 length of time. 
Our financial performance 
is dependent 
on our ability 
to sustain or 
increase coal production 
and 
 maintain or increase operating margins. Our coal production and production costs are, 
in many respects, subject 
 to conditions and events beyond our control, which could disrupt our operations and 
have a significant impact on 
 our financial results. Adverse operating conditions and 
events that we may have experienced in the past or 
may 
 experience in the future include: 
 
a failure to achieve the Met coal qualities or quantities 
anticipated from exploration activities; 
 
variations in 
mining and 
geological 
conditions from 
those anticipated, 
such as 
variations in 
coal seam 
 thickness and quality, 
and geotechnical conclusions; 
 
operational and technical 
difficulties encountered in mining, 
including equipment failure, 
delays in moving 
 longwall equipment, drag-lines and other equipment and maintenance 
or technical issues; 
 
adverse weather conditions 
or natural or 
man-made disasters, including 
hurricanes, cyclones, tornadoes, 
 floods, droughts, bush 
fires, seismic activities, 
ground failures, rock 
bursts, structural cave-ins 
or slides 
 and other 
catastrophic events 
(such as 
the COVID-19 
pandemic that 
has caused 
significant disruption 
 across nearly 
all industries 
and markets, 
including global 
supply chain 
shortages, the 
impact of 
which, 
 continues to be uncertain); 
 
insufficient or unreliable infrastructure, such as power, 
water and transport; 
 
industrial and 
environmental accidents, 
such as 
releases of 
mine-affected water 
and diesel 
spills (both 
 of which have affected our Australian Operations 
in the past); 
 
industrial disputes and labor shortages; 
 
mine safety accidents, including fatalities, fires and explosions 
from methane and other sources; 
 
competition 
and 
conflicts 
with 
other 
natural 
resource 
extraction 
and 
production 
activities 
within 
 overlapping operating areas, such as natural gas extraction 
or oil and gas development; 
 
unexpected shortages, or increases in the costs, of consumables, 
spare parts, plant and equipment; 
 
cyber-attacks 
that 
disrupt 
our 
operations 
or 
result 
in 
the 
dissemination 
of 
proprietary 
or 
confidential 
 information about us to our customers or other third 
parties; and 
 
security breaches or terrorist acts. 
 If any 
of the 
foregoing conditions 
or events 
occurs and 
is not 
mitigated or 
excusable as 
a force 
majeure event 
 under 
our 
coal 
sales 
contracts, 
any 
resulting 
failure 
on 
our 
part 
to 
deliver 
coal 
to 
the 
purchaser 
under 
such 
 contracts 
could 
result 
in 
economic 
penalties, 
demurrage 
costs, 
suspension 
or 
cancellation 
of 
shipments 
or 
 ultimately termination 
of such 
contracts, which 
could 
have a 
material adverse 
effect 
on our 
financial condition 
 and results of operations.

 Our U.S. 
Operations are 
concentrated in 
a small 
number of 
mines in 
the CAPP 
and our 
Australian Operations 
 include one 
mine in 
the Bowen 
Basin of 
Australia. As 
a result, 
the effects 
of any 
of these 
conditions or 
events 
 may be exacerbated and may have a disproportionate 
impact on our results of operations and assets. Any such 
 operational 
conditions 
or 
events 
could 
also 
result 
in 
disruption 
to 
key 
infrastructure 
(including 
infrastructure 
 located at or serving our mining activities, as well as the infrastructure that 
supports freight and logistics). These 
 conditions and events could 
also result in the 
partial or complete closure 
of particular railways, ports or 
significant 
 inland waterways 
or sea 
passages, potentially 
resulting in 
higher costs, 
congestion, delays 
or cancellations 
on 
 some 
transport 
routes. 
Any 
of 
these 
conditions 
or 
events 
could 
adversely 
impact 
our 
business 
and 
results 
of 
 operations. 
 Our long-term 
success depends 
upon our 
ability to 
continue discovering, 
or acquiring 
and developing 
 assets containing, coal reserves that are economically 
recoverable. 
 Our recoverable reserves decline 
as we produce coal. 
Our long-term outlook depends 
on our ability to maintain 
 a commercially viable portfolio of coal reserves that are economically recoverable. Failure to acquire or discover 
 new coal reserves or 
develop new assets could 
negatively affect our financial condition and 
results of operations. 
 Exploration activity may occur adjacent to established 
assets and in new regions. These activities 
may increase 
 land tenure, 
infrastructure 
and related 
political risks. 
Failure to 
discover or 
acquire new 
coal reserves, 
replace 
 coal reserves or develop new assets or operations in sufficient quantities to maintain or grow the 
current level of 
 reserves could negatively affect our financial condition 
and results of operations. 
 Potential changes to our portfolio of assets through acquisitions and divestments may have an adverse effect on 
 future results 
of operations 
and financial 
condition. From 
time to 
time, we 
may add 
assets to, 
or divest 
assets 
 from, our portfolio. There are a number of risks associated with historical 
and future acquisitions or divestments, 
 including, among others: 
 
adverse market 
reaction to 
such acquisitions 
and divestments 
or the 
timing or 
terms on 
which acquisitions 
 and divestments are made; 
 
imposition of adverse regulatory conditions and obligations; 
 
political and country risk; 
 
commercial objectives not being achieved as expected; 
 
unforeseen liabilities arising from changes to the portfolio; 
 
sales revenues and operational performance not meeting 
expectations; 
 
anticipated synergies or cost savings being delayed or not 
being achieved; and 
 
inability to retain key staff and transaction-related costs 
being more than anticipated. 
 These factors could materially and adversely affect 
our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We rely 
on estimates 
of our 
recoverable resources 
and reserves, 
which are 
complex due 
to geological 
 characteristics of the properties and the number of 
assumptions made. 
 We rely on estimates of our recoverable resources and reserves. 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we report 
 our estimated resources 
and reserves in 
accordance with 
subpart 1300 
of Regulation S-K 
under the Exchange 
 Act. See Item 
2. Properties. 
Subpart 1300 of 
Regulation S-K requires 
us to disclose 
our mineral resources, 
in 
 addition to 
our mineral reserves. 
In addition, 
as an 
ASX-listed company, our ASX disclosures 
follow the Australian 
 Code 
for 
Reporting 
of 
Exploration 
Results, 
Mineral 
Resources 
and 
Ore 
Reserves 
2012, 
or 
the 
JORC 
Code. 
 Accordingly, 
our estimates 
of resources 
and reserves 
in this 
Annual Report 
on Form 
10-K and 
in other 
reports 
 that 
we 
are 
required 
to 
file 
with 
the 
SEC 
may 
be 
different 
than 
our 
estimates 
of 
resources 
and 
reserves 
as 
 reported in our ASX disclosures.

 Coal 
is 
economically 
recoverable 
when 
the 
price 
at 
which 
it 
can 
be 
sold 
exceeds 
the 
costs 
and 
expenses 
of 
 mining 
and 
selling 
the 
coal. 
The 
costs 
and 
expenses 
of 
mining 
and 
selling 
the 
coal 
are 
determined 
on 
a 
 mine-by-mine basis, and as a result, the price at which our coal is economically recoverable varies based on the 
 mine. We 
base our resource 
and reserve 
information on geologic 
data, coal ownership 
information and current 
 and 
proposed 
mine 
plans, 
and 
mining 
cost 
assumptions 
may 
be 
affected 
by 
changes 
in 
mine 
planning 
or 
 scheduling over 
time. There 
are numerous 
uncertainties 
inherent in 
estimating 
quantities 
and qualities 
of coal 
 and 
costs 
to 
mine 
recoverable 
reserves, 
including 
many 
factors 
beyond 
our 
control. 
There 
are 
inherent 
 uncertainties and risks associated with such estimates, including: 
 
geologic and mining conditions, 
which may not be 
fully identified by available 
exploration data and may 
 differ from our experience and assumptions in areas 
we currently mine; 
 
current 
and 
future 
market 
prices 
for 
coal, 
contractual 
arrangements, 
operating 
costs 
and 
capital 
 expenditures; 
 
severance and 
excise 
taxes, 
unexpected 
governmental 
taxes, royalties 
, 
stamp 
duty and 
development 
 and reclamation costs; 
 
future mining technology improvements; 
 
the effects of regulation by governmental agencies; 
 
the ability to obtain, maintain and renew all required permits; 
 
employee health and safety; and 
 
historical production from the area compared with production from 
other producing areas. 
 Except 
for 
that 
portion 
of 
mineral 
resources 
classified 
as 
mineral 
reserves, 
mineral 
resources 
do 
not 
have 
 demonstrated economic value. Even 
if a mineral 
resource exists, there can 
be no assurance that 
any part of 
such 
 mineral resource will ever be converted to mineral reserves. 
 In addition, estimates of coal resources and reserves are revised based on actual production experience, and/or 
 new exploration 
information and therefore 
the estimates 
of coal resources 
and reserves 
are subject to 
change. 
 Should we 
encounter geological 
conditions or 
qualities different 
from those 
predicted by 
past drilling, 
sampling 
 and similar examinations, estimates 
of coal resources and reserves 
may have to be adjusted 
and mining plans, 
 coal processing and infrastructure may have to be 
altered in a way that might adversely affect our 
operations. As 
 a result, our estimates may not accurately reflect our actual future coal 
resources and reserves. 
 As 
a 
result, 
the 
quantity 
and 
quality 
of 
the 
coal 
that 
we 
recover 
may 
be 
less 
than 
the 
resource 
and 
reserve 
 estimates included in 
this Annual Report 
on Form 10-K. 
If our actual coal 
resources and reserves 
are less than 
 current estimates, 
or the 
rate at 
which they 
are recovered 
is less 
than estimated 
or results 
in higher 
than estimated 
 cost, our financial condition and results of operations may 
be materially adversely affected. 
 Our 
profitability 
could 
be 
affected 
adversely 
by 
the 
failure 
of 
suppliers 
and/or 
outside 
contractors 
to 
 perform. 
 We use 
contractors and 
other third 
parties for 
exploration, mining 
and other 
services generally, 
and are 
reliant 
 on several 
third parties 
for the 
success of 
our current 
operations and 
the development 
of our 
growth projects. 
 While 
this 
is normal 
for 
the 
mining 
industry, 
problems 
caused 
by third 
parties 
may arise, 
which 
may 
have 
an 
 impact on our performance and operations. In particular, the majority of workers at our 
Australian Operations are 
 employed by contractors, including Thiess Pty Ltd, Golding 
Contractors Pty Ltd, and Wolff Mining 
Pty Ltd.

 Operations 
at 
our 
mines 
may 
be 
interrupted 
for 
an 
extended 
period 
in 
the 
event 
that 
we 
lose 
any 
of 
our 
key 
 contractors (because their 
contract is terminated or 
expires) and are required 
to replace them. There 
can be no 
 assurance that skilled third parties or 
contractors will continue to be 
available at reasonable rates. 
As we do not 
 have the 
same control 
over contractors 
as we 
do over 
employees, we 
are also 
exposed to 
risks related 
to the 
 quality or 
continuation of 
the services 
of, and 
the equipment 
and supplies 
used by, 
our contractors, 
as well 
as 
 risks related 
to the 
compliance of our 
contractors with environmental 
and health and 
safety legislation and 
internal 
 policies, standards and 
processes. Any failure 
by our key 
contractors to comply 
with their obligations 
under our 
 operating agreements with 
them (whether as a 
result of financial, safety 
or operational difficulties 
or otherwise), 
 any 
termination 
or 
breach 
of 
our 
operating 
agreements 
by 
our 
contractors, 
any 
protracted 
dispute 
with 
a 
 contractor, 
any inability 
to perform 
due to 
global pandemics 
or other 
health concerns, 
including the 
COVID-19 
 pandemic, 
any material labor dispute between our contractors and their employees or any major labor action by 
 those employees 
against 
our 
contractors, 
could 
have 
a material 
adverse 
effect 
on 
our financial 
condition 
and 
 results of operations. 
 Further, in 
periods of high 
commodity prices, demand 
for contractors may 
exceed supply resulting 
in increased 
 costs or lack 
of availability 
of key contractors. 
Disruptions of 
operations or 
increased costs also 
can occur as 
a 
 result of disputes with contractors or a shortage 
of contractors with particular capabilities. To 
the extent that any 
 of the foregoing risks were to materialize, our operating 
results and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
 Our inability to replace or 
repair damaged or destroyed 
equipment or facilities in 
a timely manner could 
 materially and adversely affect our financial condition 
and results of operations. 
 We depend on several 
major pieces of mining 
equipment and facilities to 
produce and transport coal, 
including, 
 but 
not 
limited 
to, 
longwall 
mining 
systems, 
continuous 
miners, 
draglines, 
dozers, 
excavators, 
shovels, 
haul 
 trucks, conveyors, 
CPPs and 
rail loading 
and blending 
facilities. Obtaining 
and repairing 
these major 
pieces of 
 equipment often involves long lead 
times. If any of these 
pieces of equipment and facilities suffers major 
damage 
 or is destroyed by fire, 
abnormal wear and tear, 
flooding, incorrect operation or 
otherwise, we may be unable 
to 
 replace or repair them in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost, which would impact our ability 
to produce and 
 transport 
coal 
and 
could 
materially 
and 
adversely 
affect 
our financial 
condition 
and 
results 
of 
operations. 
Our 
 ability to replace or 
repair damaged or destroyed 
equipment or facilities 
may also be dependent 
on suppliers or 
 manufacturers remaining operational and having the relevant equipment, work force or services available for us. 
 Suppliers 
and 
manufacturers 
may be 
unable 
to 
provide 
such 
equipment, 
work 
force 
or service 
for 
a 
range 
of 
 reasons, 
including 
but 
not 
limited 
to 
their 
business 
suffering 
adverse 
effects 
as 
a 
result 
of 
global 
pandemics, 
 including the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 Additionally, regulatory agencies sometimes make changes with regard to requirements for pieces of 
equipment. 
 Such changes can impose costs on us and can cause delays if manufacturers and suppliers are unable to make 
 the required changes in compliance with mandated deadlines. 
 Our 
ability to 
operate effectively 
could 
be impaired 
if we 
lose key 
personnel 
or fail 
to 
attract qualified 
 personnel. 
 The loss of key personnel and the failure to recruit sufficiently qualified staff 
could affect our future performance. 
 We have entered into employment 
contracts with a number of 
key personnel in Australia 
and the United States, 
 including 
our 
Managing 
Director 
and 
Chief 
Executive 
Officer, 
Garold 
Spindler, 
our 
Chief 
Operating 
Officer, 
 Australia, Douglas 
Thompson, 
our Group 
Chief Financial 
Officer, 
Gerhard 
Ziems, 
and Chief 
Operating 
Officer 
 U.S., Jeffrey Bitzer. On January 17, 2023, 
Coronado announced that Mr. Spindler will retire from 
his role as Chief 
 Executive Officer 
and transition 
to the 
position of 
Executive Chair 
of the 
Board of 
Directors, and 
the Company 
 also announced that Mr. 
Thompson will be appointed as Chief 
Executive Officer of the Company. 
Mr. Spindler s 
 and Mr. 
Thompson s new 
positions will be 
effective immediately 
following the Company s 
2023 Annual General 
 Meeting of Stockholders.

 Mr. Spindler s, Mr. 
Thompson s, 
Mr. Ziems and 
Mr. Bitzer s expertise and 
experience in the mining industry 
are 
 important to the 
continued development 
and operation 
of our mining 
interests. However, 
there is 
no assurance 
 that such personnel 
will remain with 
us for the 
term of their 
employment contracts or beyond. 
In the United 
States, 
 we have not 
entered into 
employment contracts 
with any 
of our key 
personnel (other 
than Mr. 
Spindler and 
his 
 direct reports), meaning that we do 
not have the benefit of notice 
provisions or non-compete restraints with these 
 employees. There 
may be 
a limited 
number of 
persons with 
the requisite 
experience and 
skills to 
serve in 
our 
 senior management positions. We may not be 
able to locate or employ 
qualified executives on acceptable terms. 
 In addition, as our business develops and 
expands, we believe that our future 
success will depend greatly on our 
 continued ability 
to attract and 
retain highly 
skilled personnel 
with coal 
industry experience 
in Australia 
and the 
 United States. We may not be able to continue to employ key 
personnel or attract and retain qualified personnel 
 in the future. 
The loss of 
such key 
personnel or 
the failure to 
recruit sufficiently 
qualified employees 
may affect 
 our business and future performance. 
 We may not have adequate insurance coverage 
for some business risks. 
 We have insurance coverage for certain 
operating risks that provide limited coverage 
for some potential liabilities 
 associated with our 
business. As 
a result of 
market conditions, premiums 
and deductibles for 
certain insurance 
 policies 
can 
increase 
substantially, 
and 
in 
some 
instances, 
certain 
insurance 
may 
become 
unavailable 
or 
 available only for reduced amounts of coverage. As a result, we may not be able 
to renew our existing insurance 
 policies or 
procure 
other 
desirable 
insurance 
on commercially 
reasonable 
terms, 
if at 
all. In 
addition, 
we 
may 
 become subject 
to liability 
(including in 
relation to 
pollution, occupational 
illnesses 
or other 
hazards), 
or suffer 
 loss resulting from 
business interruption, for 
which we are 
not insured (or 
are not sufficiently 
insured) or cannot 
 insure, including liabilities in respect of past activities. 
 Should we suffer a major 
uninsured loss, future financial 
performance could be materially 
adversely affected. In 
 addition, insurance may not 
continue to be available 
at economically acceptable 
premiums or coverage may 
be 
 reduced. As 
a result, 
the insurance 
coverage 
may not 
cover the 
full scope 
and extent 
of claims 
against us 
or 
 losses we 
may incur. 
The occurrence 
of a 
significant 
adverse event 
not fully 
or partially 
covered by 
insurance 
 could have a material adverse effect on our financial 
condition and results of operations. 
 Cybersecurity 
attacks, 
natural 
disasters, 
terrorist 
attacks 
and 
other 
similar 
crises 
or 
disruptions 
may 
 negatively affect our business, financial condition 
and results of operations. 
 Our 
business 
may 
be 
impacted 
by 
disruptions 
such 
as 
cybersecurity 
attacks 
or 
failures, 
threats 
to 
physical 
 security, 
and 
extreme 
weather 
conditions 
or other 
natural disasters. 
Strategic 
targets, 
such 
as energy-related 
 assets, may be 
at greater risk 
of future terrorist 
or cybersecurity attacks 
than other targets 
in the United 
States 
 or 
Australia. 
These 
disruptions 
or 
any 
significant 
increases 
in 
energy 
prices 
that 
follow 
could 
result 
in 
 government-imposed price 
controls. Our 
insurance may 
not protect 
us against 
such occurrences. 
It is 
possible 
 that any of these 
occurrences, or a 
combination of them, 
could have a material 
adverse effect on 
our business, 
 financial condition and results of operations. 
 In addition, a disruption in, 
or failure of, our information 
technology systems could adversely affect 
our business 
 operations 
and 
financial 
performance. 
We 
rely 
on 
the 
accuracy, 
capacity 
and 
security 
of 
our 
information 
 technology, 
or IT, 
systems for the operations 
of many of our 
business processes and to 
comply with regulatory, 
 legal and tax 
requirements. While 
we maintain 
some of 
our critical IT 
systems, we 
are also dependent 
on third 
 parties 
to 
provide 
important 
IT 
services 
relating 
to, 
among 
other 
things, 
human 
resources, 
electronic 
 communications 
and 
certain 
finance 
functions. 
Despite 
the 
security 
measures 
that 
we 
have 
implemented, 
 including those 
related to cybersecurity, our systems 
could be breached 
or damaged by 
computer viruses, natural 
 or man-made 
incidents or 
disasters or 
unauthorized physical 
or electronic 
access. Though 
we have 
controls in 
 place, we cannot provide assurance that a cyber-attack 
will not occur. 

 Furthermore, we may 
have little or 
no oversight with 
respect to security 
measures employed by 
third-party service 
 providers, which may ultimately prove to be ineffective at countering threats. Failures of our IT systems, whether 
 caused 
maliciously 
or inadvertently, 
may 
result 
in 
the 
disruption 
of 
our 
business 
processes, 
the 
unauthorized 
 release 
of 
sensitive, 
confidential 
or 
otherwise 
protected 
information 
or 
the 
corruption 
of 
data, 
which 
could 
 adversely affect our 
business operations and 
financial performance. We may 
be required to 
incur significant costs 
 to protect against and remediate the damage caused by 
such disruptions or system failures in the future.

 Mining in the 
CAPP is more 
complex and involves 
more regulatory constraints than 
mining in other areas 
 of the U.S., which could affect our mining operations 
and cost structures in these areas. 
 Mining in the CAPP is more 
complex and involves more 
regulatory constraints than mining 
in other areas of the 
 United 
States, 
which 
could 
affect 
our 
mining 
operations 
and 
cost 
structures 
in 
these 
areas. 
The 
geological 
 characteristics of coal reserves in the CAPP, 
such as depth of overburden and coal seam thickness, make them 
 complex 
and 
costly 
to 
mine. 
As 
mines 
become 
depleted, 
replacement 
reserves 
may 
not 
be 
available 
or, 
if 
 available, may not 
be able 
to be 
mined at 
costs comparable to 
those of 
the depleting mines. 
In addition, compared 
 to mines 
in the 
other areas 
of the 
United States, 
permitting, 
licensing and 
other 
environmental 
and regulatory 
 requirements are more costly and time 
consuming to satisfy. 
These factors could materially adversely 
affect the 
 mining operations 
and cost 
structures of, 
and our 
customers ability 
to use 
coal produced 
by, our mining properties 
 in the CAPP. 
 Financial and Strategic Risks 
 The loss 
of, or 
significant reduction 
in, purchases 
by our 
largest customers 
could adversely 
affect our 
 revenues. 
 For the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2022, our 
top ten 
customers comprised 
73.1 
 of our 
total revenue 
and our 
 top five customers comprised 
52.6 
 of our total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 
sales to Tata 
 Steel and Xcoal represented 
19.4 
 and 11.7 ,
 respectively, 
of our total revenue. 
The majority of our sales 
are 
 made on 
a spot 
basis or 
under contracts 
with terms 
of typically 
one year. The 
failure to 
obtain additional 
customers 
 or 
the 
loss 
of 
all 
or 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
revenues 
attributable 
to 
any 
customer 
as 
a 
result 
of 
competition, 
 creditworthiness, 
inability 
to 
negotiate 
extensions, 
replacement 
of 
contracts 
or 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
global 
 pandemics, 
including 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic, 
or 
otherwise, 
may 
adversely 
affect 
our 
business, 
financial 
 condition and results of operations. 
 If a substantial number 
of our customers fail 
to perform under our 
contracts with them, our revenues 
and 
 operating profits could suffer. 
 A significant portion of the sales of our Met coal is to 
customers with whom we have had long-term relationships. 
 The success of our business depends on our 
ability to retain our current customers, renew our existing customer 
 contracts 
and 
solicit 
new 
customers. 
Our 
ability 
to 
do 
so 
generally 
depends 
on 
a 
variety 
of 
factors, 
including 
 having our mines 
operational, having the type 
and quantity of 
coal available, the quality 
and price of 
our products, 
 our ability to market these products effectively, our ability to deliver on a timely basis and the level of competition 
 that we face. 
 In addition, our 
sales contracts 
generally contain 
provisions that 
allow customers 
to suspend or 
terminate if 
we 
 commit a material breach of the terms of the contract, a change in law 
restricts or prohibits a party from carrying 
 out its 
material obligations 
under the 
contract or 
a material 
adverse change 
occurs in 
our financial 
standing or 
 creditworthiness. If customers suspend 
or terminate existing contracts, 
or otherwise refuse to accept 
shipments 
 of our Met 
coal for which 
they have an 
existing contractual 
obligation, our revenues 
will decrease, and 
we may 
 have to reduce production at our mines until our customers 
contractual obligations are honored. 
 If our customers do not 
honor contract commitments, 
or if they terminate agreements 
or exercise force majeure 
 provisions 
allowing 
for 
the 
temporary 
suspension 
of 
performance 
during 
specified 
events 
beyond 
the 
parties 
 control, including the COVID-19 pandemic and we are unable to replace the contract, our financial condition and 
 results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

 If our ability 
to collect 
payments from 
customers is 
impaired, our 
revenues and 
operating profits 
could 
 suffer. 
 Our 
ability 
to 
receive 
payment 
for 
coal 
sold 
and 
delivered 
will 
depend 
on 
the 
continued 
creditworthiness 
and 
 contractual performance of our customers and counterparties. For certain customers, we require the provision of 
 a letter of credit as 
security for payment. The inability of key customers 
to procure letters of credit (due 
to general 
 economic conditions or the 
specific circumstances of the 
customer) may restrict our 
ability to contract with such 
 customers or result in fewer sales contracts being executed, which could materially adversely affect our financial 
 condition and results of operations. For certain of our large customers 
in Australia who have not provided letters 
 of 
credit 
or 
other 
form 
of 
security, 
we 
maintain 
an 
insurance 
policy 
to 
cover 
for 
any 
failure 
in 
payment. 
This 
 insurance coverage, however, 
may not cover the full scope 
and extent of losses we 
may incur as the result 
of a 
 payment default or otherwise. 

 If a customer 
does not 
pay amounts 
due in 
a timely 
manner, 
we may 
decide to sell 
the customer s coal 
on the 
 spot market, which may be 
at prices lower than the contracted 
price, or we may be unable 
to sell the coal at all. 
 If our customers or counterparties creditworthiness deteriorates, 
our business could be adversely affected. 

 Changes in credit 
ratings issued by 
nationally recognized statistical 
rating organizations could 
adversely 
 affect our cost of financing and the market price 
of our securities. 

 Credit rating agencies 
could downgrade our ratings 
due to factors specific 
to our business, 
a prolonged cyclical 
 downturn in the 
mining industry or 
macroeconomic trends 
(such as global 
or regional recessions) 
and trends in 
 credit and 
capital markets 
more generally. 
Any decline 
in our credit 
ratings would 
likely result 
in an 
increase to 
 our cost of financing, limit our access to the capital markets, significantly harm our financial condition and results 
 of operations, 
hinder 
our ability 
to refinance 
existing 
indebtedness 
on 
acceptable 
terms 
and 
have an 
adverse 
 effect on the market price of our securities. 
 Our existing and future indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our 
 businesses, which could 
prevent us 
from fulfilling our 
obligations under our 
senior secured notes, 
senior 
 secured asset-based revolving 
credit agreement in 
an initial 
aggregate principal amount 
of 100.0 
million, 
 or the ABL Facility, 
and other debt, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations 
 under our debt, which may not be successful. 
 As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
we 
had 
 242.3
 million 
aggregate 
principal 
amount 
of 
our 
senior 
secured 
notes 

 outstanding. As of December 31, 2022, 
no amounts were outstanding, and 
no outstanding letters of credit issued 
 under the ABL Facility. 
As of December 31, 2022, the available borrowing capacity under this facility was 100.0 
 million. 

 We dedicate a 
portion of our 
cash flow from 
operations to the 
payment of debt 
service, reducing the 
availability 
 of our cash flow 
to fund capital expenditures, 
acquisitions or strategic 
development initiatives and 
other general 
 corporate purposes. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on 
 our ability to 
generate cash in 
the future and our 
financial condition and operating 
performance, which are subject 
 to prevailing economic and competitive 
conditions and to certain 
financial, business and other factors 
beyond our 
 control. There can be no assurance that we 
will maintain a level of cash flows from 
operating activities sufficient 
 to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, 
and interest on our debt. In addition, any failure to comply 
with 
 covenants in the 
instruments governing 
our debt could 
result in an 
event of default 
that, if not 
cured or 
waived, 
 would have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Our 
level 
of 
indebtedness 
could 
have 
further 
consequences, 
including, 
but 
not 
limited 
to, 
increasing 
our 
 vulnerability to adverse 
economic or industry 
conditions, placing us 
at a competitive 
disadvantage compared 
to 
 other businesses in 
the industries in 
which we 
operate that are 
not as leveraged 
and that may 
be better positioned 
 to withstand 
economic downturns, 
limiting our 
flexibility to 
plan for, 
or react 
to, changes 
in our 
businesses and 
 the industries in which we operate, and requiring us to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt. We may not 
 be 
able 
to 
refinance 
on 
commercially 
reasonable 
terms 
or 
at 
all, 
and 
any 
refinancing 
of 
our 
debt 
could 
be 
at 
 higher interest rates 
and may require 
us to comply 
with more onerous 
covenants, making it more 
difficult to obtain 
 surety bonds, letters of credit or 
other financial assurances that may be 
demanded by our vendors or regulatory 
 agencies, particularly during periods in which credit markets 
are weak.

 If 
we 
are 
unable 
to 
service 
our 
debt 
obligations, 
we 
could 
face 
substantial 
liquidity 
problems 
and 
we 
may 
be 
 forced to 
reduce or delay 
investments and capital 
expenditures, or to 
sell assets, seek 
additional capital, including 
 additional secured or unsecured debt, or restructure or refinance our debt, and we may be unable to continue as 
 a going concern. 
We may be 
unable to consummate 
any proposed asset 
sales or recover 
the carrying value 
of 
 these assets, 
and 
any proceeds 
may 
not 
be adequate 
to 
meet 
any 
debt 
service 
obligations 
then 
due. 
Any 
of 
 these 
examples 
potentially 
could 
have 
a 
material 
adverse 
impact 
on 
our 
results 
of 
operations, 
profitability, 
 stockholders equity and capital structure. 
 We 
adjust 
our 
capital 
structure 
from 
time 
to 
time 
and 
may 
need 
to 
increase 
our 
debt 
leverage, 
which 
 would make us more sensitive to the effects of 
economic downturns. 
 It is 
possible that we 
may need 
to raise additional 
debt or 
equity funds 
in the 
future. Our ABL 
Facility and operating 
 cash flows may not be adequate to fund our ongoing capital requirements, for any future acquisitions or projects 
 or to 
refinance our 
debt. There 
is no 
guarantee that 
we will 
be able 
to refinance 
our existing 
debt, or 
if we 
do, 
 there is no guarantee that such new funding will be on 
terms acceptable to us. 
 Global credit markets have been severely constrained in the 
past, such as during a global financial crisis and the 
 European sovereign 
debt crisis, 
and during 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic, 
and 
the ability 
to obtain 
new funding 
or 
 refinance in 
the future 
may be 
significantly reduced. 
If we 
are unable 
to obtain 
sufficient funding, 
either due 
to 
 banking and 
capital market 
conditions, generally, 
or due 
to factors 
specific to 
our 
business, we 
may not 
have 
 sufficient cash to meet our 
ongoing capital requirements, which 
in turn could materially and 
adversely affect our 
 financial 
condition. 
Failure 
to 
obtain 
sufficient 
financing 
could 
cause 
delays 
or 
abandonment 
of 
business 
 development plans and have a material adverse effect 
on our business, operations and financial condition. 
 In 
recent 
years, 
certain 
financial 
institutions, 
investment 
managers 
and 
insurance 
companies 
globally 
have 
 responded to pressure 
to take actions 
to limit or 
divest investments in, financing 
made available to, 
and insurance 
 coverage 
provided 
for, 
the 
development 
of 
new 
coal-fired 
power 
plants 
and 
coal 
miners 
that 
derive 
revenues 
 from thermal 
coal sales. 
For 
example, in 
2017, some 
financial institutions 
publicly announced 
that they 
would 
 stop funding new thermal coal projects or would 
otherwise reduce their overall lending to coal 
producers. These 
 or similar 
policies 
may adversely 
impact 
the coal 
industry 
generally, 
our ability 
to 
access 
capital and 
financial 
 markets in the future, our costs of capital and the future 
global demand for coal. 
 Our business may require substantial ongoing capital 
expenditures, and we may not have access to 
the 
 capital required to reach full productive capacity at our 
mines. 
 Maintaining 
and 
expanding 
mines 
and 
related 
infrastructure 
is 
capital 
intensive. 
Specifically, 
the 
exploration, 
 permitting 
and 
development 
of 
Met 
coal 
reserves, 
mining 
costs, 
the 
maintenance 
of 
machinery, 
facilities 
and 
 equipment 
and 
compliance 
with 
applicable 
laws 
and 
regulations 
require 
ongoing 
capital 
expenditures. 
Any 
 decision to increase 
production at our existing 
mines or to 
develop the high-quality Met 
coal recoverable reserves 
 at our 
development properties in 
the future 
could also affect 
our capital 
needs or 
cause future 
capital expenditures 
 to be higher than in the past and/or higher than our estimates. We cannot assure that we will be able to maintain 
 our production 
levels or 
generate sufficient cash 
flow, or that 
we will 
have access 
to sufficient financing 
to continue 
 our 
production, 
exploration, 
permitting 
and 
development 
activities 
at 
or 
above 
our 
present 
levels 
and 
on 
our 
 present levels or levels achieved prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and on our current or projected timelines, and 
 we may be required to 
defer all or a portion 
of our capital expenditures. 
Our results of operations, 
business and 
 financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
if we cannot make such capital expenditures. 
 To 
fund our 
capital expenditures, 
we will 
be required 
to use 
cash from 
our operations, 
incur debt 
or raise 
new 
 equity. 
Our ability 
to obtain 
bank financing 
or our 
ability to 
access the 
capital markets 
for future 
equity or 
debt 
 offerings, on the other hand, may 
be limited by our financial 
condition at the time of any 
such financing or offering 
 and the 
covenants in 
our existing 
debt agreements, 
as well 
as by 
general economic 
conditions, contingencies 
 and uncertainties that 
are beyond 
our control. If 
cash flow generated 
by our operations 
or available borrowings 
 under our 
bank financing 
arrangements are 
insufficient to 
meet our 
capital requirements 
and we 
are unable 
to 
 access 
the 
capital 
markets 
on 
acceptable 
terms 
or 
at 
all, 
we 
could 
be 
forced 
to 
curtail 
the 
expansion 
of 
our 
 existing mines and the development of 
our properties which, in turn, could 
lead to a decline in 
our production and 
 could materially and adversely affect our business, 
financial condition and results of operations.

 We may not recover 
our investments in our 
mining, exploration and other 
assets, which may require 
us 
 to recognize impairment charges related to those assets. 
 Our balance sheet includes a number of assets that are subject to impairment risk, particularly long-lived assets, 
 including 
property, 
plant 
and 
equipment, 
mining 
tenements, 
exploration 
and 
evaluation 
assets 
and 
intangible 
 assets (including goodwill). 
The values of 
these assets 
are generally derived 
from the fundamental 
valuation of 
 the underlying mining operations and, as 
such, are subject to many of 
the same risks to which our 
operations are 
 exposed, including 
decreases in 
coal prices, 
foreign currency 
exchange risks, 
operational and 
geological risks, 
 changes in coal production and changes in estimates of proven and 
probable coal reserves. Adverse changes in 
 these and 
other risk 
factors could 
lead to 
a reduction 
in the 
valuation of 
certain 
of our 
assets and 
result in 
an 
 impairment charge being recognized. 
 Risks 
related 
to 
our 
investment 
in 
WICET 
may 
adversely 
affect 
our 
financial 
condition 
and 
results 
of 
 operations. 
 We have 
a minority 
interest in 
WICET Holdings 
Pty Ltd, 
whose wholly 
owned subsidiary, 
Wiggins Island 
Coal 
 Export Terminal 
Pty Ltd, or WICET Pty Ltd, owns WICET. Other coal producers who export coal through WICET 
 also hold 
shares 
in 
WICET 
Holdings 
Pty Ltd. 
In addition, 
we 
and the 
other coal 
producers (or 
shippers) 
have 
 evergreen, ten 
year take-or-pay 
agreements with 
WICET Pty 
Ltd and 
pay a 
terminal handling 
charge to 
export 
 coal through 
WICET, 
which 
is calculated 
by reference 
to WICET s 
annual 
operating 
costs, 
as well 
as finance 
 costs associated with WICET Pty Ltd s external 
debt facilities. 
 Under our take-or-pay agreement with WICET 
Pty Ltd, or the WICET Take 
-or-Pay Agreement, Curragh s export 
 capacity is 1.5 MMtpa and we 
are obligated to pay the 
terminal handling charge for this capacity, whether utilized 
 or not. The terminal handling 
charge calculation is based on 
total operating and finance costs 
of WICET Pty Ltd 
 being charged to contracted shippers in proportion to each shipper s contracted capacity. Under the terms of the 
 WICET 
Take 
-or-Pay 
Agreement 
the 
terminal 
handling 
charge 
payable 
by 
us 
can 
be 
adjusted 
(increased 
or 
 decreased) by WICET Pty Ltd if WICET Pty 
Ltd s operating and finance costs change, 
or if a contracted shipper 
 defaults on its take-or-pay agreement obligations and has its contracted capacity reduced to 
nil. Under the terms 
 of the WICET Take 
-or-Pay Agreement there is a limit of how much WICET Pty Ltd can charge us for recovery of 
 its finance costs, referred to as a finance cap. 
Since WICET began operating in April 2015, four WICET Holdings 
 Pty Ltd shipper-shareholders 
have defaulted on their 
obligations under their respective 
take-or-pay agreements 
 and 
subsequently 
had 
those 
agreements 
terminated. 
The 
result 
of 
these 
terminations 
is 
a 
decrease 
in 
the 
 aggregate contracted tonnage at WICET from 27 MMtpa to 
15.5 MMtpa. 
 Given the 
operation 
of the 
finance cap 
(which 
has been 
reached, 
subject 
to further 
adjustment 
for Consumer 
 Price Index, 
or CPI) there 
is a 
limit to the 
recovery by 
WICET of its 
financing costs 
from shippers. Accordingly, 
 prior defaults referred 
to above have 
resulted in only 
minor increases to 
the terminal handling 
charges payable 
 by the remaining 
shipper shareholders (including us). 
These increases have related 
to higher A /ton (or 
US /ton) 
 charge for 
operating 
costs 
resulting 
from 
a 
lower 
contract 
base. 
If 
any of 
the 
remaining 
shipper 
shareholders 
 becomes 
insolvent 
and/or 
defaults 
under 
its 
take-or-pay 
agreement, 
the 
terminal 
handling 
charges 
for 
the 
 remaining shipper shareholders, including us, may increase proportionately to pay the defaulting shipper s share 
 of WICET s 
operating 
and 
financing costs 
going forward 
(noting that 
the 
finance cap 
applies 
in respect 
of the 
 financing costs component of the terminal handling charges). 
 In addition, if we default under the WICET Take 
-or-Pay Agreement and that default is not remedied, then we will 
 be obligated 
to pay 
a termination 
payment. The 
termination payment 
is equal 
to the 
lesser of 
our proportion 
of 
 WICET Pty Ltd s 
total external 
debt (which 
is based on 
the proportion 
that our contracted 
tonnage bears to 
the 
 total contracted tonnage 
at WICET when 
the payment obligation 
is triggered) and 
ten years equivalent 
terminal 
 handling 
charges 
at 
the 
prevailing 
rate 
at 
the 
time 
that 
the 
termination 
payment 
falls 
due. 
We 
have 
provided 
 security to WICET 
Pty Ltd in 
the form of 
a bank guarantee, the 
amount of which 
is required to 
cover our estimated 
 liabilities as a shipper under the WICET Take 
-or-Pay Agreement for the following twelve-month 
period. 

 In the event of WICET Pty Ltd defaulting on its external debt obligations, external lenders to WICET Pty Ltd may 
 enforce 
their 
rights 
to 
the 
security 
over 
the 
assets 
of 
WICET 
and 
appoint 
a 
receiver 
to 
take 
steps 
to 
recover 
 outstanding debt. The 
external lenders 
do not have 
direct recourse to 
the shippers 
to recover outstanding 
debt 
 and shipper take-or-pay agreements would remain on foot and access to the port would continue to be available 
 to us. 

 In the 
event of 
a permanent 
cessation of 
operations 
at WICET, 
we may 
be required 
to procure 
additional 
port 
 capacity elsewhere, as well as be liable for a termination payment 
under the WICET Take 
-or-Pay Agreement.

 Risks related to 
the Supply Deed 
with Stanwell may 
adversely affect 
our financial condition 
and results 
 of operations. 
 Curragh has a CSA, 
as amended from 
time to time, 
with Stanwell to 
supply thermal coal 
to the Stanwell 
Power 
 Station. The 
CSA restricted 
Curragh from 
mining the 
SRA which 
was reserved 
for the 
benefit of 
Stanwell and 
 could not be 
mined without 
Stanwell s consent. 
Under the 
CSA, in addition 
to supplying thermal 
coal at 
a price 
 below the cost 
to Curragh 
of mining and 
processing the 
coal, Curragh 
pays certain 
rebates to 
Stanwell on 
Met 
 coal exported 
from certain 
parts of 
Curragh, which 
represents 
the deferred 
purchase 
cost of 
the right 
to mine 
 some areas at Curragh. Our cost of 
supplying coal to Stanwell has been 
and may continue to be greater than 
the 
 price paid by Stanwell. 

 On August 14, 2018, Curragh entered into the Supply 
Deed with Stanwell. The Supply Deed grants Curragh 
the 
 right 
to 
mine 
the 
coal 
reserves 
in 
the 
SRA. 
In 
exchange 
for 
these 
rights, 
Curragh 
has 
agreed 
to 
certain 
 amendments to 
the CSA 
and to 
enter into 
the NCSA, 
which will 
commence on 
or around 
the expiration 
of the 
 CSA (currently 
expected to 
expire in 
2027). 
On July 
12, 2019, 
Curragh 
entered into 
the NCSA 
with Stanwell. 

 Curragh agreed that 
the total value 
of the discount 
received by Stanwell 
on coal supplied 
to it under 
the NCSA 
 should (by the expiry date 
of the NCSA) be equal 
to the net present value 
of A 210 million as at 
the date of the 
 Supply Deed. 
No export rebates 
are payable during 
the term of 
the NCSA. The 
amortized cost of 
the deferred 
 consideration was 243.2 million (A 359.0 million) as of December 
31, 2022. 
 We could 
be adversely 
affected if we 
fail to 
appropriately provide financial 
assurances for 
our obligations. 
 Australian laws and 
U.S. federal and 
state laws require 
us to provide 
financial assurances related 
to requirements 
 to reclaim lands used 
for mining, to pay 
federal and state workers 
compensation, to provide financial assurances 
 for coal 
lease obligations 
and to 
satisfy other 
miscellaneous obligations. 
The primary 
methods we 
use to 
meet 
 those obligations in 
the United States 
are to provide 
a third-party surety 
bond or provide 
a letter of credit. 
As of 
 December 31, 2022, 
we provided 34.9
 million of third-party 
surety bonds in 
connection with our 
U.S. Operations. 
 There are no cash collateral requirements to support any 
of the outstanding bonds. 
 Our financial 
assurance obligations 
may increase 
due to 
a number 
of factors, 
including the 
size of 
our mining 
 footprint and 
new government 
regulations, 
and 
we may 
experience 
difficulty 
procuring 
or renewing 
our surety 
 bonds. In addition, our bond issuers may demand higher fees or additional collateral, including letters of 
credit or 
 other terms less favorable to us upon those renewals. Because we are required by federal and state law to have 
 these 
bonds 
or 
other 
acceptable 
security 
in 
place 
before 
mining 
can 
commence 
or 
continue, 
any 
failure 
to 
 maintain surety bonds, letters 
of credit or other guarantees or 
security arrangements would adversely 
affect our 
 ability to mine coal. That failure 
could result from a variety 
of factors, including lack of 
availability of surety bond 
 or letters of credit, 
higher expense or 
unfavorable market terms, 
the exercise by 
third-party surety bond 
issuers 
 of their right 
to refuse 
to renew 
the surety 
and the 
requirement to 
provide collateral 
for future 
third-party surety 
 bond 
issuers 
under 
the 
terms 
of 
financing 
arrangements. 
If 
we 
fail 
to 
maintain 
adequate 
bonding, 
our 
mining 
 permits could be 
invalidated, which would 
prevent mining operations from 
continuing, and future 
operating results 
 could be materially adversely affected. 
 In 
Australia, 
the 
Financial 
Provisioning 
Act 
amended 
the 
financial 
assurance 
provisions 
of 
the 
EP 
Act, 
and 
 impacted the way that our Australian Operations 
provide for and manage associated costs 
of providing financial 
 assurances related to mine rehabilitation obligations. 
 The Financial Provisioning Act: 
 
amended 
the 
financial 
assurance 
arrangements 
for 
resource 
activities 
under 
the 
EP 
Act 
with 
a 
new 
 financial provisioning 
scheme, and 
changed 
how the 
ERC for 
an environmental 
authority is 
calculated; 
 and 
 
amended 
the 
EP 
Act 
to 
introduce 
new 
requirements 
for 
the 
progressive 
rehabilitation 
and 
closure 
of 
 mined land.

 Since April 1, 2019, any financial assurance currently 
held for environmental approvals already held 
in Australia 
 are 
treated 
as 
surety 
under 
the 
Financial 
Provisioning 
Act. 
There 
was 
a 
transition 
period 
of 
three 
years 
that 
 commenced 
in 
early 
2019 
during 
which 
all 
miners 
in 
Queensland 
were 
assessed 
and 
received 
an 
initial 
risk 
 allocation 
decision 
based 
on 
a 
formulaic 
calculation 
of 
their 
ERC. 
Our 
ERC 
is 
the 
cost 
estimated 
by 
the 
 government department 
of rehabilitating 
the land 
on which 
our operation 
is carried 
out. This 
allocation put 
our 
 resource activity 
at Curragh 
into a 
risk category 
under the 
Financial 
Provisioning Act 
based on 
the regulator s 
 assessment of both 
the amount of 
our ERC and 
our financial capacity 
to carry out 
and discharge the 
rehabilitation 
 liability and obligation 
at the time 
our mining 
operations cease. 
This risk assessment 
is reviewed annually, 
and 
 assessment fees are payable each time there is an allocation 
decision for our operations in Queensland. 
 The financial provisioning 
scheme is managed 
by the Scheme 
Manager and financial 
assurance is provided 
by 
 paying 
a 
contribution 
to 
the 
Scheme 
and/or 
the 
giving 
of 
surety 
to 
the 
Scheme 
Manager. 
Our 
contribution 
is 
 calculated 
as 
the 
prescribed 
percentage 
(dependent 
on 
risk 
allocation 
decision) 
of 
Curragh s 
ERC. 
The 
 prescribed percentages 
for each 
category are: 
(1) Very 
low: 0.5 ; 
(2) Low: 1.0 ; 
and (3) Moderate: 
2.75 . In 
 the event Curragh s ERC is allocated a 
high risk allocation, we are required to 
negotiate the percentage of surety 
 to be provided with the Scheme Manager. The Scheme Manager is a statutory officer and manages the Scheme 
 contributions and the sureties on behalf of the Queensland 
State Government. 

 In 
October 
2022, 
the 
Scheme 
Manager 
completed 
the 
assessment 
of 
the 
Annual 
Review 
Allocation 
for 
 environmental authority 
number EPML00643713 
and issued 
an Annual 
Review Allocation 
of Moderate . 
The 
 moderate rating results in Curragh being 
obliged to make a financial contribution 
to the Scheme of 2.75 of the 
 ERC. 
In January 
2023, the 
Scheme 
Manager 
completed 
an assessment 
of the 
Annual 
Review 
Allocation 
for 
 Environmental Authority 
Number EPVX00635313 
and issued 
an Annual 
Review Allocation 
of High 
in respect 
 of MDL162 
requiring 
Curragh 
to 
maintain 
its 
historical 
financial 
assurance 
in 
respect 
of 
100 
of 
the 
ERC 
for 
 Environmental Authority Number EPVX00635313. 
 There can be no assurance that our risk category allocation 
will not change in future years. 

 Our financial assurance obligations may increase due to 
a number of factors, including but not limited to: 
 
any change that increases ERC or area of disturbance; 
 
any major Environmental Authority amendment; 
 
compliance with existing Environmental Authority obligations; and 
 
major changes to financial soundness of the EA Holder. 
 For more information on the Financial Provisioning Act, see 
Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Australia 
 Environmental Protection Act 1994 (Qld). 
 Mine closures entail substantial costs. If we prematurely close one or more of our mines, our operations 
 and financial performance would likely be affected 
adversely. 
 Federal and state 
regulatory agencies 
have the 
authority following 
significant health 
and safety 
incidents, such 
 as 
fatalities, 
to 
order 
mining 
operations 
to 
be 
temporarily 
suspended 
or 
a 
facility 
be 
permanently 
closed. 
For 
 example, on 
January 12, 
2020, operations 
at our 
Curragh mine 
were temporarily 
suspended after 
a contractor 
 was 
fatally 
injured 
during 
a 
tire 
change 
activity 
in 
the 
main 
workshop 
on 
site 
and 
on 
November 
21, 
2021, 
 operations at our Curragh mine were temporarily suspended after an employee was fatally injured while working 
 in the dragline 
operations. We could also 
be required to 
close or discontinue 
operations at particular 
mines before 
 the end 
of their 
mine life 
due to 
environmental, 
geological, 
geotechnical, 
commercial, 
leasing or 
other issues. 
 Such 
closure 
or 
discontinuance 
of 
operations 
could 
result 
in 
significant 
closure 
and 
rehabilitation 
expenses, 
 employee redundancy 
costs, contractor 
demobilization costs 
and other 
costs or 
loss of 
revenues. If 
and when 
 incurred, these closure and 
rehabilitation costs could exceed 
our current estimates. If 
one or more of our 
mines 
 is closed earlier 
than anticipated, we 
would be required 
to fund the 
reclamation and closure costs 
on an 
expedited 
 basis and potentially 
lose revenues and, 
for some 
of our operations, 
pay for take-or-pay 
arrangements that 
we 
 no longer use, which would 
have an adverse impact on 
our operating and financial performance. 
Many of these 
 costs could also 
be incurred 
if a mine 
was unexpectedly 
placed on care 
and maintenance 
before the end 
of its 
 planned mine life 
such as our 
mines in the 
U.S. Operations, which 
were temporarily idled 
in 2020 as a 
result of 
 the COVID-19 pandemic.

 If the 
assumptions underlying 
our provision 
for reclamation 
and mine 
closure obligations 
prove to 
be 
 inaccurate, we could be required to expend greater 
amounts than anticipated. 
 The 
Environmental 
Protection 
Act 1994 
(Qld) 
and 
the 
SMCRA 
establish 
operational, 
reclamation 
and 
closure 
 standards 
for 
all 
aspects 
of 
surface 
mining 
as 
well 
as 
deep 
mining. 
We 
accrue 
for 
the 
costs 
of 
current 
mine 
 disturbance 
and 
final 
mine 
closure, 
including 
the 
cost 
of 
treating 
mine 
water 
discharge 
where 
necessary. 
 Estimates of 
our total 
reclamation and 
mine-closing 
liabilities totaled 
 138.5
 million as 
of December 
31, 2022, 
 based upon 
permit requirements 
and the 
historical 
experience at 
our operations, 
and depend 
on a 
number 
of 
 variables involving assumptions and estimation and therefore may be subject to change, including the estimated 
 future 
asset 
retirement 
costs 
and the 
timing 
of 
such 
costs, 
estimated 
proven 
reserves, 
assumptions 
involving 
 third-party contractors, inflation rates 
and discount rates. 
If these accruals 
are insufficient or our 
liability in a 
future 
 year is 
greater than 
currently anticipated, 
our future 
operating results 
and financial 
position could 
be adversely 
 affected. See 
Item 7. Management s Discussion 
and Analysis 
of Financial 
Condition and 
Results of 
Operations 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. 
 We are subject to foreign exchange risks involving 
certain operations in multiple countries. 
 Loss sustained from adverse movements 
in currency exchange rates 
can impact our financial performance 
and 
 financial position and the level of additional funding required to support 
our businesses. Our financial results are 
 reported 
in 
US 
and 
certain 
parts 
of 
our 
liabilities, 
earnings 
and 
cash 
flows 
are 
influenced 
by 
movements 
in 
 exchange rates, especially movements in A 
to US exchange rate. For 
example, costs relating to our 
Australian 
 Operations 
are 
generally 
denominated 
in 
A . 
In 
addition, 
foreign 
currency 
exposures 
arise 
in 
relation 
to 
coal 
 supply 
contracts, 
procurement 
of 
plant 
and 
equipment 
and 
debt, 
which 
may 
be 
priced 
in 
A 
or 
other 
foreign 
 currencies other than US . 
 The impact of currency exchange rate movements will vary depending on factors such as the nature, magnitude 
 and duration 
of the movements, 
the extent 
to which 
currency risk 
is hedged under 
forward exchange 
contracts 
 or other hedging instruments and the terms of these contracts. We may enter into forward exchange 
contracts to 
 hedge a portion of our 
foreign currency exposure of 
our Australian Operations from 
time to time. The unhedged 
 portion of our non-US 
exposures against exchange rate fluctuations will 
be at the risk 
of any adverse movement 
 in exchange rates, which may affect our operating results, 
cash flows and financial condition. 
 Interest rates could change substantially and have an adverse 
effect on our profitability. 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk 
in relation to variable-rate bank balances 
and variable-rate borrowings. Our 
 interest rate risk primarily arises from fluctuations in LIBOR and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Yield, or BBSY, 
in 
 relation to US - 
and A -denominated borrowings, 
respectively. 
Our lending rates 
may increase in 
the future as 
 a result of factors beyond our control and may 
result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of 
 operations. 
 In addition, 
national and 
international regulators 
and law 
enforcement agencies 
have conducted 
investigations 
 into a number of rates or indices, which 
are deemed to be reference rates. 
Actions by such regulators and law 
 enforcement agencies may result 
in changes to the 
manner in which certain 
reference rates are determined, 
their 
 discontinuance, 
or 
the 
establishment 
of 
alternative 
reference 
rates. 
For 
example, 
after 
2021, 
the 
United 
 Kingdom s Financial 
Conduct Authority, 
which regulates 
LIBOR, no 
longer compelled banks 
to submit rates 
for 
 the 
calculation 
of 
non-U.S.-dollar 
LIBOR. 
U.S-dollar 
LIBOR 
must 
be 
replaced 
before 
June 
30, 
2023. 
The 
 Alternative Reference Rates 
Committee has proposed 
SOFR as its 
recommended alternative 
to LIBOR. At 
this 
 time, it 
is not 
possible to 
predict the 
effect that 
these developments, 
any discontinuance, 
modification or 
other 
 reforms to 
LIBOR or any 
other reference rate, 
or the 
establishment of alternative 
reference rates, including 
SOFR, 
 may 
have 
on 
LIBOR 
or 
other 
benchmarks, 
including 
LIBOR-based 
borrowings 
under 
our 
variable-rate 
bank 
 balances and variable-rate borrowings. 
Furthermore, the use of 
alternative reference rates or 
other reforms could 
 cause the 
market value 
of, the 
applicable interest 
rate on 
and the 
amount 
of interest 
paid on 
our benchmark-
 based borrowings 
to be 
materially 
different 
than 
expected and 
could 
materially 
adversely 
impact 
our ability 
to 
 refinance such borrowings or raise future indebtedness 
on a cost effective basis.

 We may 
be unsuccessful 
in integrating 
the operations 
of acquisitions 
with our 
existing operations 
and 
 in realizing all or any part of the anticipated benefits of 
any such acquisitions. 
 From time to time, we 
may evaluate and acquire assets and businesses that 
we believe complement our existing 
 assets and business. Acquisitions may 
require substantial capital or 
the incurrence of substantial indebtedness. 
 Our capitalization 
and results 
of operations 
may change 
significantly as 
a result 
of future 
acquisitions. Acquisitions 
 and business expansions involve numerous risks, including the 
following: 
 
difficulties in the integration of the assets and operations 
of the acquired businesses; 
 
inefficiencies 
and 
difficulties 
that 
arise 
because 
of 
unfamiliarity 
with 
new 
assets 
and 
the 
businesses 
 associated with them and new geographic areas; 
 
the diversion of management s attention from other 
operations; and 
 
timing, and whether the acquisition 
or business expansion is occurring 
during adverse economic, social 
 and regulatory periods. 
 Further, 
unexpected 
costs 
and 
challenges 
may 
arise 
whenever 
businesses 
with 
different 
operations 
or 
 management 
are 
combined, 
and 
we 
may 
experience 
unanticipated 
delays 
in 
realizing 
the 
benefits 
of 
an 
 acquisition. Entry into certain lines of 
business may subject us to new 
laws and regulations with which we 
are not 
 familiar and may lead 
to increased litigation and 
regulatory risk. Also, following 
an acquisition, we may 
discover 
 previously 
unknown liabilities 
associated with 
the acquired 
business 
or assets 
for which 
we have 
no recourse 
 under applicable indemnification provisions. If a new business generates insufficient revenue or if we are unable 
 to efficiently manage our expanded operations, 
our results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 Coronado 
Global 
Resources Inc. 
is 
a 
holding 
company 
with 
no 
operations 
of 
its 
own 
and, 
as 
such, 
it 
 depends 
on 
its 
subsidiaries 
for 
cash 
to 
fund 
its 
operations 
and 
expenses, 
including 
future 
dividend 
 payments, if any. 
 As a 
holding company, 
our 
principal 
source 
of cash 
flow 
is 
distributions 
from 
our 
subsidiaries. 
Therefore, 
our 
 ability to fund and conduct our business, service our debt, 
and pay dividends, if any, 
in the future will depend on 
 the 
ability 
of 
our 
subsidiaries 
to 
generate 
sufficient 
cash 
flow 
to 
make 
upstream 
cash 
distributions 
to 
us. 
Our 
 subsidiaries are separate legal 
entities, and although they 
are wholly-owned and controlled 
by us, they have 
no 
 obligation to make any funds available to us, whether 
in the form of loans, dividends, or otherwise. The 
ability of 
 our 
subsidiaries 
to 
distribute 
cash 
to 
us 
will 
also 
be 
subject 
to, 
among 
other 
things, 
restrictions 
that 
may 
be 
 contained in our subsidiary agreements (as entered into from time to time), availability 
of sufficient funds in such 
 subsidiaries and applicable laws and regulatory restrictions. Claims of any creditors of our subsidiaries generally 
 will have 
priority as 
to the 
assets of 
such subsidiaries 
over our 
claims and 
claims of 
our creditors 
and stockholders. 
 To 
the extent the ability 
of our subsidiaries 
to distribute dividends or 
other payments to us 
is limited in any 
way, 
 our ability to fund and conduct our business, service our 
debt, and pay dividends, if any, 
could be harmed. 
 Legal, Compliance and Sustainability Risks 
 We could be negatively affected if 
we fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations. 
 Relations with 
our employees 
and, where 
applicable, organized 
labor are 
important to 
our success. 
Enterprise 
 bargaining and other disputes between us and our employees or disputes affecting our contractors may result in 
 strikes or uncompetitive work practices. 
 As of 
December 31, 
2022, we 
had 1,735 
employees. 
In addition, 
as of 
December 31, 
2022, there 
were 2,326
 contractors 
supplementing 
the 
permanent 
workforce, 
primarily 
at 
Curragh. 
As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
 approximately 
11.5 
of our 
total employees, 
all at 
our 
Australian Operations, 
were represented 
by organized 
 labor unions and covered 
by the EA. In 
May 2019, the Australian 
Fair Work Commission 
approved the Curragh 
 Mine Enterprise 
Agreement 2019. 
This EA 
has a 
nominal expiration 
date of 
May 26, 
2022 and 
but remains 
in 
 place by 
operation of 
the Fair 
Work Act 
2009 (Cth) 
until replaced 
or terminated 
by the 
Fair Work 
Commission. 
 We have 
been negotiating 
with employee 
bargaining representatives 
for a 
replacement EA 
since March 
2022. 
 Those negotiations continue 
in good faith 
with the intent 
of reaching an 
agreement as 
soon as practicable. 
Our 
 U.S. Operations employ a 100 non-union labor force

 Future industrial 
action by 
our employees 
or mining 
contractors employees or 
involving trade unions 
could disrupt 
 operations and negatively impact mine productivity, 
production and profitability. 
 Our operations 
may impact 
the environment 
or cause 
exposure to 
hazardous substances, 
which could 
 result in material liabilities to us. 
 We are 
subject to 
extensive environmental 
laws and 
regulations, 
and our 
operations may 
substantially 
impact 
 the 
environment 
or 
cause 
exposure 
to 
hazardous 
materials 
to 
our 
contractors, 
our 
employees 
or 
local 
 communities. We use hazardous materials 
and generate hazardous or other regulated 
waste, which we store in 
 our storage or disposal 
facilities. We may become subject to 
statutory or common law claims 
(including damages 
 claims) as 
a result 
of 
our 
use of 
hazardous 
materials 
and generation 
of hazardous 
waste. 
A number 
of laws, 
 including, in 
the United 
States, the 
CERCLA or 
Superfund, and 
the RCRA, 
and in 
Australia, the 
Environmental 
 Protection Act 1994 (Qld), 
impose liability relating to 
contamination by hazardous 
substances. Furthermore, the 
 use of 
hazardous materials 
and generation 
of hazardous 
and other 
waste may 
subject us 
to investigation 
and 
 require the clean-up of soil, surface water, 
groundwater and other media. 
 Mining 
operation 
process, 
including 
blasting 
and 
processing 
ore 
bodies, 
can 
also 
generate 
environmental 
 impacts. These 
impacts include, 
but are 
not limited 
to, leakages 
of polluting 
substances, 
explosions, 
flooding, 
 fires, accidental mine water discharges, 
and excessive dust and noise. Such 
risks could result in damage to 
the 
 applicable mine site, personal 
injury to our employees 
and contractors, environmental 
damage, decreased coal 
 production and 
possible legal 
liability under 
environmental regulations. 
Employee or 
strict liability 
claims under 
 common law 
or environmental 
regulations in 
relation to 
these matters 
may arise, 
for example, out 
of current 
or 
 former activities 
at sites 
that we 
own, lease 
or operate 
and at 
properties to 
which hazardous 
substances have 
 been sent for treatment, 
storage, disposal or other 
handling. Our liability 
for such claims may 
be strict, joint and 
 several with other miners or parties or with our 
contractors, such that we may be held 
responsible for more than 
 our 
share 
of 
the 
contamination 
or 
other 
damages, 
or 
even 
for 
the 
entire 
amount 
of 
damages 
assessed. 
 Additionally, 
any violations of 
environmental laws by 
us could lead 
to, among other 
things, the imposition 
on us 
 of substantial fines, 
penalties, other civil and 
criminal sanctions, the curtailment 
or cessation of 
operations, orders 
 to 
pay 
compensation, 
orders 
to 
remedy 
the 
effects 
of 
violations 
and 
take 
preventative 
steps 
against 
possible 
 future violations, 
increased compliance costs, 
or costs 
for environmental remediation, 
rehabilitation or 
rectification 
 works. 
 We maintain extensive 
Met coal refuse 
areas and slurry impoundments 
at our mining 
properties. At Curragh, coal 
 slurry 
is 
disposed 
of 
by 
pumping 
into 
an 
impoundment 
area 
where 
particles 
are 
allowed 
to 
settle. 
We 
have 
 procedures 
in 
place 
that 
the 
Curragh 
slurry 
impoundments 
remain 
below 
the 
surrounding 
topography 
so 
that 
 there is 
minimal likelihood 
of failure 
and/or spills. 
At our 
U.S. Operations, 
refuse areas 
and impoundments 
are 
 frequently inspected and subject 
to extensive governmental regulation. 
Slurry impoundments have 
been known 
 to 
fail, 
releasing 
large 
volumes 
of 
coal 
slurry 
into 
the 
surrounding 
environment. 
Structural 
failure 
of 
an 
 impoundment can result in extensive damage to the environment 
and natural resources, such as bodies of water 
 that the coal slurry reaches, as well as create liability for 
related personal injuries, property damages and injuries 
 to natural resources 
and plant and 
wildlife. Of the 
five refuse areas 
among our U.S. 
mining properties, only 
two 
 impound slurry; the other facilities are combined refuse 
and do not impound slurry. 
Two of our impoundments 
in 
 the U.S. overlie 
mined out 
areas, which 
can pose 
a heightened 
risk of 
failure and 
the assessment 
of damages 
 arising out of such failure. 
If one of our impoundments 
were to fail, we could 
be subject to substantial 
claims for 
 the resulting environmental contamination and associated 
liability, as well as 
for related fines and penalties. 
 Changes in 
and compliance 
with government 
policy, regulation 
or legislation 
may adversely 
affect our 
 financial condition and results of operations. 
 The coal mining industry 
is subject to regulation 
by federal, state and 
local authorities in each 
relevant jurisdiction 
 with respect 
to 
a range 
of industry 
specific and 
general 
matters. 
Any future 
legislation 
and 
regulatory 
change 
 imposing more constraints or 
more stringent requirements may 
affect the coal mining 
industry and may adversely 
 affect our financial condition and results of operations. Examples of such changes are, future laws or regulations 
 that may limit 
the emission 
of GHGs, attach 
a cost to 
GHG emissions, 
or limit the 
use of thermal 
coal in power 
 generation, more stringent workplace health and safety laws, more rigorous environmental laws, and changes to 
 existing taxation and royalty legislation.

in the future 
incur, significant expenditures to comply 
with such regulation 
 and legislation. These laws are constantly evolving and may become increasingly 
stringent. The ultimate impact 
 of complying with existing laws 
and regulations is not always 
clearly known or determinable due 
in part to the 
fact 
 that 
certain 
implementation 
of 
the 
regulations 
for 
these 
laws 
have 
not 
yet 
been 
promulgated 
and 
in 
certain 
 instances 
are 
undergoing 
revision. 
These 
laws 
and 
regulations, 
particularly 
new 
legislative 
or 
administrative 
 proposals 
(or 
judicial 
interpretations 
of 
existing 
laws 
and 
regulations), 
could 
result 
in 
substantially 
increased 
 capital, 
operating 
and 
compliance 
costs 
and 
could 
have 
a 
material 
adverse 
effect 
on 
our 
operations 
and 
our 
 customers ability to use our products. Due in part to the extensive and comprehensive 
regulatory requirements, 
 along with 
changing interpretations 
of these 
requirements, violations 
of applicable 
federal, state 
and local 
laws 
 and regulations occur from time to time in the 
coal industry and minor violations have 
occurred at our Australian 
 Operations and our U.S. Operations in the past. 
 Moreover, changes in the law 
may impose additional standards and a heightened degree 
of responsibility for us 
 and our stockholders, directors and employees; may 
require unprecedented compliance efforts; could 
divert our 
 management s 
attention; 
and 
may 
require 
significant 
expenditures. 
For 
example, 
we 
may 
also 
be 
subject 
to 
 unforeseen 
environmental 
liabilities 
resulting 
from 
coal-related 
activities, 
which 
may 
be 
costly 
to 
remedy 
or 
 adversely impact 
our operations. 
In particular, 
the acceptable 
level of 
pollution and 
the potential 
abandonment 
 costs and obligations for which we 
may become liable as a result 
of our activities may be difficult 
to assess under 
 the current legal 
framework. To the extent that 
required expenditures, as 
with all 
costs, are not 
ultimately reflected 
 in the 
prices of 
coal, our 
operating results 
will be 
detrimentally 
impacted. The 
costs 
and operating 
restrictions 
 necessary for compliance 
with safety 
and environmental laws 
and regulations, 
which is a 
major cost 
consideration 
 for 
our 
Australian 
Operations 
and 
U.S. 
Operations, 
may 
have 
an 
adverse 
effect 
on 
our 
competitive 
position 
 relative to foreign producers and operators in 
other countries which may not be 
required to incur equivalent costs 
 in their operations. 
 We are 
also affected 
by various 
other international, 
federal, state, 
local and 
tribal or 
indigenous environmental 
 laws 
and 
regulations 
that 
impact 
our 
customers. 
To 
the 
extent 
that 
such 
environmental 
laws 
and 
regulations 
 reduce 
customer 
demand 
for 
or 
increase 
the 
price 
of 
coal, 
we 
will 
be 
detrimentally 
impacted. 
For 
additional 
 information 
about 
the 
various 
regulations 
affecting 
us, 
see 
Item 1. 
 Business Regulatory 
Matters Australia 
 and Business Regulatory Matters United States. 
 We 
are 
subject 
to 
extensive 
forms 
of 
taxation, 
which 
imposes 
significant 
costs 
on 
us, 
and 
future 
 regulations 
and 
developments 
could 
increase 
those 
costs 
or 
limit 
our 
ability 
to 
produce 
coal 
 competitively. 
 Federal, 
state 
or 
local 
governmental 
authorities 
in 
nearly 
all 
countries 
across 
the 
global 
coal 
mining 
industry 
 impose various 
forms of 
taxation 
on coal 
producers, 
including production 
taxes, 
sales-related taxes, 
royalties, 
 stamp duty, environmental 
taxes and income taxes. 

 For 
example, 
on 
September 
27, 
2022, 
we 
received 
from 
the 
Queensland 
Revenue 
Office, 
or 
QRO, 
an 
 assessment of the 
stamp duty payable 
on our acquisition 
of the Curragh 
mine in March 
2018. The QRO 
assessed 
 the stamp duty on this 
acquisition at an amount 
of 55.4 million (A 82.2 
million) plus unpaid tax 
interest of 8.2 
 million 
(A 12.1 
million). 
On 
November 
23, 
2022, 
the 
Company 
filed 
an 
objection 
to 
the 
assessment 
and 
is 
 currently awaiting the outcome of this objection. The outcome 
of this objection is uncertain. 
 We have reviewed the assessment received and based on legal and valuation advice the Company continues to 
 maintain its position regarding the estimated accrual 
of 29.0 million (A 43.0 million) stamp duty payable 
on the 
 Curragh acquisition. During the 
period we made a 
partial payment reducing the 
estimated accrual to 11.7 million 
 (A 17.3 
million) 
as 
at 
December 
31, 
2022, 
which 
is 
included 
within 
 Accrued 
Expenses 
and 
Other 
Current 
 Liabilities in its Consolidated Balance sheet. 

 We cannot 
guarantee that 
the steps 
we take 
to defend 
our position 
on this 
matter will 
be successful, 
in which 
 case the amount assessed by 
the QRO and unpaid tax interest 
on the amount outstanding may become 
due and 
 payable.

 Additionally, in 2022, the Queensland 
State Government in 
Australia amended the 
Mineral Resources Regulation 
 2013 (Qld) introducing additional 
higher tiers to the 
coal royalty rates effective 
from July 1, 2022, 
increasing the 
 royalty payable by our Australian Operations. 

 The new 
tiers applicable 
in calculating 
the royalty 
payable for 
our Australian 
Operations from 
July 1, 
2022, are 
 as set out below: 
 
7 for average coal price per Mt sold up to and including 
A 100 per Mt; 
 
12.5 for average coal price per Mt sold from A 100 to 
A 150 per Mt; 
 
15 for average coal price per Mt sold from A 150 to 
A 175 per Mt; 
 
20 for average coal price per Mt sold from A 175 to 
A 225 per Mt; 
 
30 for average coal price per Mt sold from A 225 to 
A 300 per Mt; and 
 
40 for average coal price per Mt sold above A 300 per 
Mt. 
 If new legislation or 
regulations related to various forms 
of coal taxation or 
income or other taxes 
generally, which 
 increase our costs or limit our ability to compete 
in the areas in which we sell coal, or which 
adversely affect our 
 key customers, are adopted, or if the 
basis upon which such duties 
or taxes are assessed or levied, 
changes or 
 is different from that provided by us, our business, financial condition or results of 
operations could be adversely 
 affected. 
 We may be subject 
to litigation, the disposition 
of which could negatively 
affect our profitability and cash 
 flow 
in 
a 
particular 
period, 
or 
have 
a 
material 
adverse 
effect 
on 
our 
business, 
financial 
condition 
and 
 results of operations. 
 Our profitability or cash flow in 
a particular period could be affected by 
an adverse ruling in any litigation that 
may 
 be filed against us in the future. In addition, such litigation could have 
a material adverse effect on our business, 
 financial condition and results of operations. See Item 
3. Legal Proceedings. 
 We have no 
registered trademarks for 
our Company 
name used by 
us in the 
United States or 
any other 
 countries, and failure to obtain those registrations 
could adversely affect our business. 
 Although 
we 
have 
filed 
a 
trademark 
application 
for 
use 
of 
the 
stylized 
mark 
 CORONADO 
STEEL 
STARTS 
 HERE in the United States and Australia, our applications are still pending 
and the corresponding mark has not 
 been registered 
in 
the 
United 
States 
or 
Australia. 
We 
have 
not 
filed 
for 
this 
or 
other 
trademarks 
in 
any 
other 
 country. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections. If so, we will have an opportunity 
 to respond, 
but we 
may be 
unable to 
overcome such 
rejections. In 
addition, Intellectual 
Property Australia 
and 
 the United 
States Patent 
and Trademark Office 
and comparable agencies 
in many 
foreign jurisdictions 
may permit 
 third parties to oppose pending trademark 
applications and to seek to 
cancel registered trademarks. If opposition 
 or 
cancellation 
proceedings 
are 
filed 
against 
our 
trademark 
application, 
our 
trademark 
may 
not 
survive 
such 
 proceedings, 
and/or 
we 
may 
be 
required 
to 
expend 
significant 
additional 
resources 
in 
an 
effort 
to 
defend 
 ourselves in the proceedings or identify a suitable substitute 
mark for future use. 
 Risks Specific to Our Common Stock 
 Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include 
provisions that may discourage a change in control. 
 Provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or certificate of incorporation, and 
 amended and 
restated bylaws, or 
bylaws, and 
Delaware law 
could make 
it more 
difficult for a 
third-party to acquire 
 us, 
even 
if 
doing 
so 
might 
be 
beneficial 
to 
our 
stockholders. 
Provisions 
of 
our 
bylaws 
and 
certificate 
of 
 incorporation impose various procedural and other 
requirements that could make it 
more difficult for stockholders 
 to effect certain corporate actions.

 We have elected not to be governed by Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of 
the State of Delaware, 
or 
 the DGCL (or any successor provision thereto), 
until immediately following the time at 
which the EMG Group no 
 longer beneficially 
owns in 
the aggregate 
shares of 
our common 
stock representing 
at least 
10 of 
our voting 
 stock, in which case we 
shall thereafter be governed by 
Section 203 if and 
for so long as Section 
203 by its terms 
 would apply 
to us. 
Section 203 
provides that 
an interested 
stockholder, 
along with 
its affiliates 
and associates 
 (i.e., a stockholder that has 
purchased greater than 15 , 
but less than 85 , of 
a company s outstanding voting 
 stock (with 
some exclusions)), 
may not 
engage in 
a business 
combination 
transaction 
with the 
company for 
a 
 period of three years after buying more than 15 of a company s outstanding voting stock unless certain criteria 
 are met or certain other corporate actions are taken by the company. 
 These provisions could limit the price 
that certain investors might be willing 
to pay in the future for 
shares of our 
 common stock and may have the effect of delaying 
or preventing a change in control. 
 Our 
certificate 
of 
incorporation 
limits 
the 
personal 
liability 
of 
our 
directors 
for 
certain 
breaches 
of 
 fiduciary duty. 
 Our 
certificate 
of 
incorporation 
and 
bylaws 
include 
provisions 
limiting 
the 
personal 
liability 
of 
our 
directors 
for 
 breaches 
of 
fiduciary 
duty 
under 
the 
DGCL. 
Specifically, 
our 
certificate 
of 
incorporation 
contains 
provisions 
 limiting 
a 
director s 
personal 
liability 
to 
us 
and 
our 
stockholders 
to 
the 
fullest 
extent 
permitted 
by 
the 
DGCL. 
 Furthermore, our 
certificate of 
incorporation provides 
that no director 
shall be 
liable to 
us and 
our stockholders 
 for 
monetary 
damages 
resulting 
from 
a 
breach 
of 
fiduciary 
duty 
as 
a 
director, 
except 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
such 
 exemption from liability or limitation thereof is 
not permitted under the DGCL. The principal 
effect of this limitation 
 on liability 
is that 
a stockholder 
will be 
unable to 
prosecute an 
action for 
monetary damages 
against a 
director 
 unless the 
stockholder can 
demonstrate a 
basis for 
liability that 
cannot be 
eliminated under 
the DGCL. 
These 
 provisions, however, should 
not limit or eliminate our right or any stockholder s right to seek non-monetary relief, 
 such as an injunction or rescission, 
in the event of a 
breach of a director s fiduciary duty. These provisions do not 
 alter a director s liability under 
U.S. federal securities laws. 
The inclusion of these 
provisions in our certificate 
of 
 incorporation may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing 
a lawsuit against directors for 
 a breach of 
their fiduciary 
duties, even 
though such an 
action, if successful, 
might otherwise have 
benefited us 
 and our stockholders. 
 Coronado 
Group 
LLC 
and 
the 
EMG 
Group 
have 
substantial 
control 
over 
us 
and 
are 
able 
to 
influence 
 corporate matters. 
 Coronado Group 
LLC and 
the EMG 
Group have 
significant 
influence over 
us, including 
control over 
decisions 
 that 
require 
the 
approval 
of 
stockholders, 
which 
could 
limit 
the 
ability 
of 
other 
stockholders 
to 
influence 
the 
 outcome of stockholders votes. 
 As of 
December 31, 
2022, the 
EMG Group 
indirectly held 
50.4 
 of our 
outstanding shares 
of common 
stock. 
 Therefore, the EMG 
Group has 
effective control 
over the outcome 
of votes on 
all matters requiring 
approval by 
 stockholders. There is a risk that the interests of the EMG Group could conflict with or differ from our interests or 
 the interests of 
other stockholders. 
In addition, pursuant 
to the terms 
of the Stockholder s 
Agreement, dated 
as 
 of September 
24, 2018, 
between us 
and Coronado 
Group LLC, 
or the 
Stockholder s Agreement, 
so long 
as it 
 beneficially owns in the aggregate at least 25 of the outstanding shares of our common stock, the EMG Group 
 will have 
the ability 
to exercise 
substantial control 
over certain 
of our 
transactions, 
including change 
of control 
 transactions, 
such 
as 
mergers 
and 
capital 
and 
debt 
raising 
transactions. 
See Item 
5. 
 Market 
for 
Registrant s 
 Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for a description of the 
 Stockholder s Agreement. 
 Further, pursuant to 
the terms of the Series A 
Share, Coronado Group and the 
EMG Group or its successors 
or 
 permitted 
assigns, 
as 
the 
beneficial 
owner 
of 
the 
Series A 
Share, 
at 
its 
option, 
will 
have 
the 
ability 
to 
elect 
a 
 specified number of directors, or the Series A Directors, based on 
the EMG Group s aggregate level of beneficial 
 ownership of shares 
of our common 
stock. For more 
details on the 
ability of Coronado 
Group and the 
EMG Group 
 to elect Series A Directors, as 
well as the rights of 
stockholders to participate in the removal 
of any such Series 
 A 
 Directors, 
see 
Item 5.

for 
Registrant s 
Common 
Equity,

Matters 
and

 Purchases of Equity Securities.

 Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31,

71 
 Moreover, the 
EMG Group s beneficial 
ownership of shares of 
our common stock may 
also adversely affect 
the 
 price of our 
common stock 
to the extent 
equity investors 
perceive disadvantages 
in owning common 
stock of a 
 company with a controlling stockholder. 
In addition, the EMG Group 
is in the business of making 
investments in 
 companies and may, from time to time, acquire interests in businesses that 
directly or indirectly compete with us, 
 as well as businesses of our existing or potential significant 
customers. The EMG Group may acquire or seek 
to 
 acquire assets that 
we seek to 
acquire and, as 
a result, those 
acquisition opportunities 
may not be 
available to 
 us or 
may be 
more expensive 
for us 
to pursue, 
and as 
a result, 
the interests 
of the 
EMG Group 
may not 
align 
 with the interests of our other stockholders. 
 The EMG Group has the 
right, subject to certain conditions, to 
require us to cooperate in 
a sale of shares 
 of our common stock held by it (including in the form 
of CDIs) under the Securities Act. 
 Pursuant to the Registration 
Rights and Sell-Down Agreement, 
dated as of September 24, 
2018, between us and 
 Coronado 
Group LLC, 
or 
the 
Registration 
Rights 
and 
Sell-Down 
Agreement, 
Coronado 
Group LLC 
(or 
its 
 successors 
or 
permitted 
assigns 
or 
transferees) 
has 
the 
right, 
subject 
to 
certain 
conditions, 
to 
require 
us 
to 
 cooperate in a 
sell-down of 
shares of 
our common 
stock or 
CDIs held by 
it. By virtue 
of its majority 
ownership, 
 exercising its registration rights and selling a large number of shares or CDIs, Coronado Group LLC could cause 
 undue volatility in the 
prevailing market price of 
our common stock. See 
Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common 
 Equity, Related Stockholder 
Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. 
 Our non-employee directors and their respective 
affiliates, including the EMG Group, may 
be able to take 
 advantage of a corporate opportunity that would otherwise 
be available to us. 
 The corporate opportunity 
and related 
party transactions provisions 
in our 
certificate of incorporation 
could enable 
 any 
of 
our 
non-employee 
directors 
or 
their 
respective 
affiliates, 
including 
the 
EMG 
Group, 
to 
benefit 
from 
 corporate opportunities 
that might 
otherwise be 
available to 
us. Subject 
to the 
limitations of 
applicable law, 
our 
 certificate of incorporation, among other things, will: 
 
permit 
us 
to 
enter 
into 
transactions 
with 
entities 
in 
which 
one 
or 
more 
non-employee 
directors 
are 
 financially or otherwise interested; 
 
permit any non-employee director or 
his or her affiliates to 
conduct a business that competes 
with us and 
 to make investments in any kind of property in which we 
may make investments; and 
 
provide that if 
any non-employee director 
becomes aware of 
a potential business 
opportunity, transaction 
 or 
other 
matter 
(other 
than 
one 
expressly 
offered 
to 
that 
non-employee 
director 
solely 
in 
his 
or 
her 
 capacity 
as 
our 
director), 
that 
non-employee 
director 
will 
have 
no 
duty 
to 
communicate 
or 
offer 
that 
 opportunity to 
us, and 
will be 
permitted to 
communicate 
or offer 
that opportunity 
to his 
or her 
affiliates 
 and pursue or acquire such opportunity for himself 
or herself, and that non-executive director 
will not be 
 deemed 
to 
have 
acted 
in 
a 
manner 
inconsistent 
with 
his 
or 
her 
fiduciary 
or 
other 
duties 
to 
us 
or 
our 
 stockholders regarding the opportunity or acted in bad faith or in a manner inconsistent with 
our and our 
 stockholders best interests. 
 These provisions enable a 
corporate opportunity that 
would otherwise be available 
to us to be taken 
by or used 
 for the 
benefit of 
the 
non-employee 
directors 
or their 
respective 
affiliates, 
which 
include the 
EMG Group 
as a 
 result of the rights granted to it under the Stockholder s Agreement. 
 General Risk Factors 
 Any 
failure 
to 
maintain 
effective 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
may 
adversely 
affect 
our 
 financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our 
management 
is 
responsible 
for 
establishing 
and 
maintaining 
adequate 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
 reporting. 
Internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
is 
a 
process 
designed 
to 
provide 
reasonable 
assurance 
 regarding 
the 
reliability 
of 
financial 
reporting 
and 
the 
preparation 
of 
financial 
statements 
in 
accordance 
with 
 generally accepted accounting principles in the United 
States, or U.S. GAAP. 

Table of Contents 
 Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 
2022 
72 
 During the course of the preparation of our financial statements, 
we evaluate and correct any deficiencies in 
our 
 internal controls over 
financial reporting. If we 
fail to maintain an 
effective system of disclosure 
or internal controls 
 over financial 
reporting, including 
satisfaction of 
the requirements 
of Section 
404 of 
the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act of 
 2002, we may not be able to report 
accurately or timely on our financial results or adequately identify and reduce 
 fraud. Therefore, the financial condition of our business could be adversely 
affected, current and potential future 
 stockholders could lose confidence in us and/or 
our reported financial results, which may cause 
a negative effect 
 on the trading price of our 
CDIs, and we could be exposed 
to litigation or regulatory proceedings, 
which may be 
 costly or divert management attention. 

 The requirements of 
being a public company 
in the United 
States and Australia may 
strain our resources, 
 divert 
management s 
attention, 
and 
affect 
our 
ability 
to 
attract 
and 
retain 
executive 
management 
and 
 qualified board members. 
 Our CDIs are 
currently listed on 
the ASX and 
we are registered 
as a foreign 
company in 
Australia. As such 
we 
 need to ensure continuous compliance with relevant Australian laws 
and 
regulations, including the listing rules of 
 the ASX, as amended from time to time, or the ASX Listing 
Rules, 
and certain provisions of the Corporations Act 
 2001 (Cth), or the Corporations Act. 

 As a U.S. 
public company, we are subject 
to the reporting 
requirements of the 
Exchange Act, the 
Sarbanes-Oxley 
 Act 
of 
2002, 
the 
Dodd-Frank 
Wall 
Street 
Reform 
and 
Consumer 
Protection 
Act 
of 
2010 
and 
other 
applicable 
 securities laws, rules and regulations. Compliance with these laws, 
rules, and regulations may increase our legal 
 and 
financial 
compliance 
costs, 
make 
some 
activities 
more 
difficult, 
time-consuming, 
or 
costly, 
and 
increase 
 demand on 
our systems 
and resources. 
The Exchange 
Act requires, 
among other 
things, 
that 
we file 
annual, 
 quarterly, and 
current reports with respect 
to our business and 
results of operations. In 
the absence of a waiver 
 from the ASX 
Listing Rules, these 
SEC periodic reports 
will be in addition 
to our periodic 
filings required by 
the 
 ASX Listing 
Rules. 
The 
Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act of 
2002 requires, 
among 
other things, 
that we 
maintain 
effective 
 disclosure 
controls 
and 
procedures 
and 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting. 
In 
order 
to 
maintain 
and, 
if 
 required, improve our disclosure 
controls and procedures and 
internal control over financial 
reporting to meet this 
 standard, significant resources and management oversight will be required. As a result, management s attention 
 may be diverted from other 
business concerns and our 
costs and expenses will increase, 
which could harm our 
 business 
and results 
of 
operations, 
all of 
which 
could 
be magnified 
during the 
COVID-19 
pandemic. 
We 
may 
 need 
to 
hire 
more 
employees 
in 
the 
future 
or 
engage 
outside 
consultants, 
which 
will 
increase 
our 
costs 
and 
 expenses. 
 In addition, changing laws, 
regulations, and standards relating to 
corporate governance and public disclosure 
are 
 creating 
uncertainty 
for 
public 
companies, 
increasing 
legal 
and 
financial 
compliance 
costs 
and 
making 
some 
 activities more time consuming. 
These laws, regulations 
and standards are subject 
to varying interpretations, in 
 many cases due to their 
lack of specificity and, 
as a result, their 
application in practice may 
evolve over time as 
 new 
guidance 
is 
provided 
by 
regulatory 
and 
governing 
bodies. 
This 
could 
result 
in 
continuing 
uncertainty 
 regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance 
 practices. 
We 
intend 
to 
invest 
resources 
to 
comply 
with 
evolving 
laws, 
regulations 
and 
standards, 
and 
this 
 investment may result in increased 
general and administrative expenses 
and a diversion of management s 
time 
 and 
attention 
from 
sales-generating 
activities 
to 
compliance 
activities. 
If 
our 
efforts 
to 
comply 
with 
new 
laws, 
 regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by 
regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities 
 related 
to 
their 
application 
and 
practice, 
regulatory 
authorities 
may 
initiate 
legal, 
administrative 
or 
other 
 proceedings against us and our business may be harmed. 
 A state 
court located within 
the State 
of Delaware (or, if 
no state court

 Our bylaws provide 
that, unless we 
consent in writing 
to the selection

any 
action 
or

asserting 
a 
claim 
against 
the 
Company 
or 
any 
director 
or 
officer 
or 
other 
 employee or 
agent of 
the Company 
arising pursuant 
to any 
provision of 
the DGCL 
or our

any action 
asserting 
a claim 
against 
the 
Company

any 
director

officer 
or 
other 
employee 
of 
the 
 Company 
governed 
by 
the 
internal 
affairs 
doctrine 
or 
other 
 internal 
corporate 
claims 
as 
defined 
in 
 Section 115 of the DGCL. 
 The choice of 
forum provision may limit 
a stockholder s ability 
to bring a claim 
against us or our 
directors, officers, 
 employees or 
agents in 
a forum 
that it 
finds favorable, 
which may 
discourage stockholders 
from bringing 
such 
 claims 
at 
all. 
Alternatively, 
if a 
court 
were 
to 
find 
the 
choice 
of forum 
provision 
contained 
in 
our 
bylaws 
to 
be 
 inapplicable or unenforceable 
in an action, 
we may incur 
additional costs associated 
with resolving such 
action 
 in 
another 
forum, 
which 
could 
materially 
adversely 
affect 
our 
business, 
financial 
condition 
and 
results 
of 
 operations. However, the choice of forum provision does 
not apply to any actions 
arising under the Securities Act 
 or the Exchange Act. 
 The issuance of additional 
common stock or securities 
convertible into our 
common stock could 
result 
 in dilution of the ownership interest in us held by existing 
stockholders. 
 We may 
issue more 
CDIs in 
the future 
in order 
to fund 
future investments, acquisitions, 
capital raising 
transactions 
 or 
to 
reduce 
our 
debt. 
While 
we 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
the 
constraints 
of 
the 
ASX 
Listing 
Rules 
regarding 
the 
 percentage of our 
capital that we 
are able to 
issue within a 
12-month period 
(subject to applicable 
exceptions), 
 any such equity raisings may dilute the ownership of existing 
common stockholders. 

 We are subject to general 
market risks that are 
inherent to companies with publicly-traded securities 
and 
 the price of our securities may be volatile. 
 We are subject to 
the general market risks that 
are inherent in all 
securities traded on a 
securities exchange. This 
 may result 
in fluctuations 
in the 
trading price 
of our 
securities that are 
not explained 
by our 
fundamental operations 
 and activities. There is 
no guarantee that the 
price of our securities 
will increase in the 
future, even if our 
earnings 
 increase. 
 Our securities may trade at, above or below the price paid by an investor for those securities due to a number of 
 factors, including, among others: 
 
general market conditions, including investor sentiment; 
 
movements in interest and exchange rates; 
 
fluctuations in the local and global market for listed stocks; 
 
actual or anticipated 
fluctuations in 
our interim and 
annual results and 
those of other 
public companies 
 in our industry; 
 
industry cycles and trends; 
 
mergers and strategic alliances in the coal industry; 
 
changes in government regulation; 
 
potential or actual military conflicts or acts of terrorism; 
 
changes in accounting principles; 
 
announcements concerning us or our competitors; 
 
changes in government policy, 
legislation or regulation; 
 
inclusion of our securities in or removal from particular market 
indices (including S P/ASX indices); and 
 
the nature of the markets in which we operate. 

Table of Contents

 Other factors 
that may 
negatively affect 
investor sentiment 
and influence 
us, specifically, 
or the 
stock market, 
 more generally, include acts 
of terrorism, an outbreak of international hostilities, fires, floods, earthquakes, 
labor 
 strikes, civil wars, 
natural disasters, outbreaks of 
disease, including the COVID-19 
pandemic, or other man-made 
 or natural events. 
 Stock markets have 
experienced extreme price 
and volume fluctuations 
in the past 
that are 
often disproportionate 
 or 
unrelated 
to 
the 
operating 
performance 
of 
companies. 
There 
can 
be 
no 
guarantee 
that 
trading 
prices 
and 
 volumes of any securities 
will be sustained. These 
factors may materially affect the 
market price of our 
securities, 
 regardless of our 
operational performance. This 
may then significantly 
impact our ability 
to raise new 
equity which 
 may be required to fund our operations if our financial 
performance deteriorates due to other factors. 
 The payment of 
dividends and repurchases 
of our stock 
are dependent on 
a number 
of factors, and 
future 
 payments and repurchases cannot be assured. 
 The 
payment 
of 
dividends 
in 
respect 
of 
our 
common 
stock 
is 
impacted 
by 
several 
factors, 
including 
our 
 profitability, 
retained earnings, 
capital requirements 
and free 
cash flow, 
as well 
as applicable 
covenants under 
 the indenture 
governing our 
senior secured 
notes and 
covenants under 
the ABL 
Facility. 
Any future 
dividends 
 will be determined by 
our Board of Directors having 
regard to these factors, 
among others. There is 
no guarantee 
 that any dividend 
will be paid, 
or repurchases will 
be made, by 
us, or if 
paid, paid at 
previous levels. From 
time 
 to time, our Board of Directors may also cancel previously 
announced dividends.

 Curragh
 Curragh is a 
production-stage mining 
property that consists 
of two active, 
open-pit, surface mines 
(Curragh North and 
Curragh 
 Main). 
Coal mine development at the Curragh property is presently accomplished by surface mining methods and has been 
 so historically 
since the mine s 
inception. 
Curragh coals are 
widely known 
for their low 
ash, low to 
mid volatile matter, 
low 
 sulfur and low 
phosphorous content. Curragh Met 
coal products are 
also known for their 
consistent delivered quality, 
which 
 supports a consistent offtake across a diversified market base. 
A map of Curragh is shown in Figure 3.

 Figure 3. 
Coronado Curragh Mine Complex Property Location Map.
 The 
Curragh 
mine 
complex 
is 
located 
within 
the 
Bowen 
Basin 
coalfields, 
approximately 
200 
kilometers 
by 
road 
west 
of 
 Rockhampton, 
Queensland, 
Australia, 
and 
approximately 
14 kilometers 
north 
of 
the 
town 
of 
Blackwater, 
Queensland, 
 Australia. The coordinates of CPP1, which is located within Curragh Main, are 688,561 meters 
East, 7,400,933 meters North 
 in 
the 
AMG66 
grid 
system. 
Curragh 
owns 
and 
operates 
the 
necessary 
CPPs 
and 
load-out 
system 
for 
dispatches 
via 
 Blackwater 
rail 
line 
to 
the 
Port 
of 
Gladstone 
or 
the 
Stanwell 
Power 
Station. 
See 
Item 
1. 
 Business Transportation 
 Australian Operations for 
additional information regarding the 
rail and port services 
available to Curragh. Curragh 
also has 
 maintenance 
facilities 
for 
the 
fleet 
of 
mining 
equipment, 
as 
well 
as 
office 
buildings 
for 
the 
mine 
staff 
and 
personnel. 

 Established 
sealed 
roads 
connect 
the 
mine 
to 
the 
town 
of 
Emerald, 
Queensland, 
Australia, 
to 
the 
west 
and 
the 
Port 
of 
 Gladstone to the east. 
Third-party rail providers operate 
the Blackwater rail line 
and transport Curragh export 
coal, for sale 
 to international customers, to the RG Tanna 
Coal Terminal 
or Wiggins Island Coal Export Terminal 
at the Port of Gladstone. 

 Curragh domestic coal is loaded onto train wagons for transportation to the Stanwell Power Station for power generation. 
 Curragh has ready access to water, 
electricity and personnel to support its operations. 
SunWater Ltd. supplies water to 
the 
 mine complex from the Fairbairn Dam via the Bedford Weir. 
The mine complex also recycles water from on-site dams i.e., 
 old open-cut pits that capture rainfall and water from 
dewatering activities. 
Curragh has a dedicated 66-kilovolt, or kV, power 
 supply to support the 
mining operations with a 
capacity of up to 
57-megawatt, or MW, sourced from the 
main grid power. 
The 
 substation is 
located on 
the southwest 
corner of 
ML1878 with 
both 66kv and 
22kv distribution 
networks to 
supply the 
draglines, 
 shovel and CPP.

 The Mineral 
Resources Act 
1989 
(Qld), or 
MRA, and 
the Mineral 
and Energy 
Resources (Common 
Provisions) Act 
2014 
 (Qld), or MERCPA, together, 
provide for the assessment, development and utilization of mineral resources in Queensland to 
 the maximum extent 
practicable, consistent with sound 
economic and land use 
management. The MRA vests 
ownership of 
 minerals, with 
limited exceptions, in 
the Crown, 
which in 
relation to Curragh, 
is the 
Queensland Government. 
A royalty is 
 payable to the Queensland Government for the right to extract minerals. The MRA also creates different tenures for different 
 mining activities, such 
as prospecting, exploring 
and mining. A 
ML is the 
most important tenure, as 
it permits the 
extraction 
 of minerals in conjunction with other required authorities. The MRA imposes general conditions on an ML.
 We control the 
coal mining rights at 
Curragh under 14 coal 
and infrastructure MLs 
and three MDLs granted 
pursuant to the 
 MRA. 
We 
refer 
to 
the 
MLs 
and 
MDLs 
at 
Curragh, 
collectively, 
as 
the 
Tenements. 
Renewal of 
certain 
Tenements 
will be 
 required 
during the 
mine 
life of 
Curragh and 
the Queensland 
government can 
vary 
the terms 
and conditions 
on 
renewal. 
 There are a number 
of existing mining and 
petroleum tenements which overlap 
with the Tenements. The priority, consent and 
 coordination requirements under the MRA, MERCPA and the Petroleum and Gas (Production and 
Safety) Act 2004 (Qld) (as 
 relevant) may apply 
with respect to 
those overlaps. 
Extensive statutory protocols 
govern the relationships 
between co-existing 
 mining and 
exploration rights and 
these protocols 
are largely focused 
on encouraging the 
overlapping tenement 
holders to 
 negotiate and formulate arrangements that enable the 
co-existence of their respective interests. To date, we have negotiated 
 arrangements 
in place 
with all 
of 
our 
overlapping 
tenement holders 
and full 
access 
to 
all of 
our 
Tenements.
 See 
Item 1. 
 Business Regulatory Matters Australia Tenements 
for additional information regarding Curragh mining tenements. 
 Property control and mining rights at Curragh are entirely expressed in the MLs and MDLs mentioned in Item 1. Business 
 Regulatory 
Matters Australia Tenements. 
An 
overlapping 
petroleum 
tenure 
exists 
over 
the 
southern 
extents 
of 
the 
 Tenements. 
Under the Mineral 
and Energy Resources (Common 
Provisions) Act 2014 
(Qld), this requires annual 
information 
 exchanges, including 
the provision and 
maintenance of joint 
information management 
plans with the 
overlapping tenement 
 holder. 
Curragh is compliant with the legislation and there are no current restrictions to coal mining.
 As conditions to certain 
of the Tenements, 
Curragh is subject to 
royalties payable to the 
Queensland government on a 
new 
 regulated tiered structure 
introduced 1st July 
2022. This tiered 
royalty payment regime is 
dependent on the 
received AUD/t 
 revenue received from the coal sales, and varies from 7 for up to A 100/t sales, up to 40 payable for 
sales over A 300/t. 
 These royalties are 
in addition to 
the Stanwell rebate, 
as described in 
Item 1. Business Customers Stanwell. Additionally, 
 if MDL 
162 advances 
from development 
to production, 
we would 
be required 
to pay 
under 
a private 
royalty deed 
a base 
 royalty of A 0.50 per Mt of coal and a royalty of A 0.70 for every Mt of SCC produced above 2.5 MMt per year.
 A joint 
venture 
between 
Arco Australia 
Ltd., Australian 
Consolidated Industries 
Ltd., 
R.W. 
Miller 
 Co. 
and Mitsui 
 Co. 
 (Australia) first began development on certain of the Tenements in 1983. 
Later, Arco Australia Ltd. bought out the other joint 
 venturers and, in 2000, sold the Property to Wesfarmers Ltd. In 2014, 
Wesfarmers acquired MDL 162 from Peabody Budjero 
 Pty 
Ltd. 
Coronado 
acquired 
all 
the 
Tenements 
from 
Wesfarmers 
Ltd. 
in 
March 
2018. 
Production 
history 
has 
been 
 approximately 12.0 MMt in 2020, 11.1 MMt in 2021 and 9.8 MMt in 2022.
 Beginning in the 1960 s, various tenement holders began 
prospecting and exploratory drilling at Curragh. We currently have 
 an 
active, 
ongoing exploration 
program 
at 
Curragh that 
allows us 
to update 
and 
refine the 
geological 
model ahead 
of pit 
 development. 

 Coal 
mine 
development 
at 
the 
Curragh 
property 
is 
presently 
accomplished 
by 
surface 
mining 
methods 
and 
has been 
so 
 historically since 
the mine s inception. 
The mine 
characteristics and output 
levels allow 
it to 
be ranked 
as a 
large coal 
operation 
 when compared to domestic producers in Australia and worldwide. 
Curragh operates four large electric draglines, one large 
 electric shovel 
and a fleet 
of smaller contractor 
excavators. 
Contractors are employed 
for the 
pre strip, post 
strip and coal 
 mining activities. Contract highwall mining operations has commenced at Curragh North during the 2022 calendar year.
 Curragh 
has 
two 
coal 
preparation 
plants 
CPP1 
and 
CPP2. 
CPP1 
is 
the 
oldest 
of 
the 
two 
processing 
plants 
and 
has 
a 
 documented nameplate 
capacity of 
1100 
tph (as 
received). 
CPP2 has 
a documented 
nameplate capacity 
of 1200 
tph (as 
 received) with a capability of up to 1350 tph when processing selected 
feed types. 
Curragh has a loadout facility for loading 
 coal onto railcars, which is connected to the main Blackwater rail link. 
 Generally, the mining equipment and 
facilities at Curragh 
are in good 
operating condition. We 
focus on the 
long-term potential 
 of 
the 
mine 
complex 
and 
regularly 
monitor 
developments 
in 
the 
mining 
industry 
for 
technology 
improvements 
and 
new 
 equipment 
that 
could 
help 
us 
increase 
efficiency 
and 
lower 
our 
costs. 
Curragh s 
oldest 
mining 
equipment, 
including 
two 
 draglines, began operations in 1983. All of the 
draglines have additional boom (stress) monitoring systems, which 
allow us to 
 increase their 
total suspended 
load capacities, 
and still 
achieve over 
90 mechanical 
availability. 
Prior to 
our taking 
over 
 mining operations, Wesfarmers Ltd. made improvements to the processing facilities at Curragh, including the commissioning 
 of the 
second CPP 
in 2012 
and replacing 
the raw 
coal crushing 
system at 
Curragh Main 
with an 
updated circuit 
in 2016. 
 Wesfarmers 
Ltd. also 
started a 
corrosion and 
structural 
repair program 
over ten 
years ago 
that we 
have 
continued since 
 acquiring the 
mine complex. 
This program 
helps us 
ensure that 
the assets 
are available 
well into 
the future. 
From time 
to 
 time, 
we 
also 
update 
and 
improve 
other 
equipment 
and 
facilities 
to 
maintain 
their 
usefulness 
and 
optimize 
our 
 competitiveness. As of 
December 31, 2022, 
the book value of 
Curragh and its 
associated plant and equipment 
was 761.8 
 million.
 We are not 
aware of 
any significant encumbrances 
or defects 
in title with 
respect to 
the Property. 
We believe we 
have secured 
 all applicable environmental 
licenses and permits 
under both 
Queensland and Australian 
Commonwealth legislation and 
have 
 all 
permits 
and 
licenses 
regarding 
cultural 
heritage, 
native 
title 
and 
various 
other 
social 
issues.

 Barry Lay, 
BSc Geology (Hons); MAusIMM of 
Resology Pty Ltd, and 
Paul Wood, B. Eng.; 
MAusIMM(CP), who is employed 
 full-time as 
the Senior Life 
of Mine Planner 
of our 
subsidiary, 
Coronado Curragh, whom 
we refer 
to as the 
Australian QPs, 
 prepared the estimates 
of coal 
resources and reserves 
summarized in Tables 4 and 
5. 
A copy of 
the Australian 
QPs technical 
 report summary, 
or 
TRS, with 
respect 
to Curragh, 
dated 
February 21, 
2022, or 
the Curragh 
TRS, is 
filed 
as Exhibit 
96.1 
 hereto. Neither Mr. Barry Lay nor Resology Pty Ltd is affiliated with Coronado. 

 The 
Australian 
QPs prepared 
the 
estimates 
of 
coal 
resources 
and 
reserves 
using 
drilling 
data 
available 
from 
exploration 
 activities at Curragh conducted by numerous entities over time. 
Most of this information was obtained prior to 
our acquisition 
 of the Property, 
using varying drilling 
and core-logging techniques, 
survey methods and 
testing procedures. 
As a result, 
in 
 verifying 
the 
data, 
the 
Australian 
QPs 
made 
certain 
assumptions 
about 
the 
adequacy 
of 
the 
processes 
performed 
and 
 comparability of the data based on their professional experience and familiarity with Curragh.
 Per Section 
12.1 of the 
Curragh TRS, coal 
reserves were classified 
as proven 
or probable considering 
 modifying factors, 
 including mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. 
Section 22.2 of 
 the Curragh 
TRS includes 
a risk 
assessment of 
the key 
modifying factors 
that could 
potentially impact 
the operations 
and 
 therefore the estimate of coal reserves and resources.

 As 
summarized 
in 
Section 
7.1 
of 
the 
Curragh 
TRS, 
the 
concentration 
of 
exploration 
drill 
holes 
varies 
slightly 
across 
the 
 Property. 
The location of 
the drilling is 
shown on the 
maps included in 
Section 7. 
Points of observation 
include exploration 
 drill holes and mine measurements, which 
have been fully vetted and processed 
into a geologic model. The geologic model 
 is based on seam depositional 
modelling, the interrelationship of overlying 
and underlying strata on seam 
mineability, seam 
 thickness trends, 
the impact 
of seam 
structure (i.e., 
faulting), intra-seam 
characteristics, etc. 
Section 11.6 
of the 
Curragh 
 TRS summarizes the drill hole spacings and accuracy associated with each resource category.
 Coal quality is instrumental in 
determining the viability of a 
coal deposit. As per Table 
11-1 of 
the Curragh TRS, coal quality 
 conforms to international standards. These quality attributes aided in converting in-place tons to demonstrated coal reserves 
 (recoverable washed tons). Pricing data as provided by Coronado 
is described in Table 16-1 of the Curragh TRS. 
These are 
 weighted-average values across the LOM schedule.
 Regarding 
production 
rates 
as 
described 
in 
Section 13 
of 
the 
Curragh 
TRS, 
the 
mine 
plan 
and 
productivity 
expectations 
 consider 
historical 
performance 
and 
efforts 
have 
been 
made 
to 
adjust 
the 
plan 
to 
reflect 
current 
technology 
and 
future 
 conditions. 
Mine 
development and 
operation 
have 
not been 
optimized within 
the Curragh 
TRS. 
Additional mine-specific 
 factors can be found in Section 13 of the Curragh TRS. 
 Buchanan
 Buchanan is 
a production-stage 
mining property, 
consisting of 
one active 
underground mine 
and supporting 
infrastructure 
 that produces 
Low-Vol 
Met coal 
using the 
longwall mining 
method. 
The mine 
complex is 
located in 
Buchanan County 
in 
 southwest Virginia. 
A map of Buchanan is shown in Figure 4.
 Figure 4. 
Coronado Buchanan Mine Complex Property Location Map.
 The 
Buchanan 
mine 
complex 
is 
located 
approximately 6.4 
kilometers 
southeast 
of 
Oakwood, 
Virginia, 
and 
16 
kilometers 
 southeast 
of 
Grundy, 
Virginia. 
The 
coordinates 
of 
the 
Buchanan 
CPP 
are 
latitude 
37 
09' 
40" 
and 
longitude 
81 
59' 
13" 
 (Easting 
984,100 , 
Northing 320,100 
 
in the 
VA 
State Plane 
South 
NAD 27 
grid system). 
The 
nearest major 
population 
 centers 
are 
Roanoke, 
Virginia, 
and 
Lexington, 
Kentucky, 
which 
are 
about 
153 
kilometers 
northeast 
and 
290 
kilometers 
 northwest of 
the property, 
respectively. 
From U.S. 
Route 460, 
which runs 
through Oakwood, 
a well-developed 
network of 
 improved and 
unimproved roads 
provides access 
to the 
property. 
The surface 
facilities at 
Buchanan are 
located along 
a 
 Norfolk Southern 
rail line, 
which serves 
as the 
primary means 
of transport 
for produced 
coal. 
Norfolk Southern 
transports 
 coal from 
the Buchanan 
mine complex 
either to 
domestic customers 
or to 
Lamberts Point 
Coal Terminal 
Pier 6 
in Norfolk, 
 Virginia, for overseas shipment.
 Buchanan has ready access 
to water, 
electricity and personnel to 
support its operations. 
The mine complex 
sources water 
 from streams 
that flow 
over Company-owned 
property. 
The mine 
also utilizes 
ground water 
from an 
old abandoned 
mine. 

 Electricity 
is 
sourced 
from 
American 
Electric 
Power. 
Personnel 
have 
historically 
been 
sourced 
from 
the 
surrounding 
 communities in 
Buchanan, Tazewell, 
McDowell and 
Pike Counties and 
have proven 
to be adequate 
in numbers to 
operate 
 the mine complex. 
As mining is common in the surrounding areas, 
the workforce is generally familiar with mining 
practices, 
 and many are experienced miners. 

 The property mineral rights 
are composed of approximately 33,577 
total hectares, of which 25,852 
are leased or subleased 
 from private landholders under 
approximately 150 individual coal 
lease tracts, and 
7,725 hectares are owned 
by Coronado. 

 Subject to 
Coronado s exercising 
its renewal 
rights thereunder, 
all the 
leases expire 
upon exhaustion 
of the 
relevant coal 
 reserves, which is expected to occur in 2044. 

Table of Contents 
 Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 31, 
2022 
84 
 Under the 
terms of the 
relevant leases, we 
are required 
to pay 
royalties ranging 
from 4 to 
6 of 
the selling 
price of coal 
 mined from the 
corresponding leasehold and, 
for the majority, 
an annual minimum 
royalty, irrespective 
of production. 
Coal 
 produced 
at 
Buchanan, 
however, 
is 
not 
subject 
to 
 wheelage 
fees 
(i.e., 
fees 
payable 
on 
coal 
mined 
and 
removed 
from 
 properties other than the particular leasehold and hauled across the leasehold premises).
 The 
property 
was 
formerly 
controlled 
by 
Consolidation 
Coal 
Company, 
or 
CONSOL. 
Mine 
development 
was 
started 
by 
 CONSOL in 1983 and 
longwall production began in 
1987. 
Coronado acquired the Buchanan Mine 
from CONSOL in March 
 2016. 
Production history has been approximately 3.4 MMt in 2020, 4.4 MMt in 2021 and 3.9 MMt in 2022.
 Our right to 
commercially mine and 
recover coal reserves 
at Buchanan overlaps 
with the right 
of an affiliate 
of CNX Resources 
 Corporation, which we refer to as the Gas Party, to commercially recover and develop coal gas interests from the mine area. 

 The 
Gas 
Party 
and 
we 
have 
entered 
into 
certain 
agreements 
to 
regulate 
the 
interaction 
between, 
and 
coordinate, 
our 
 respective operations. 
In general, 
the combination 
of these 
overlapping interests 
allows for 
mutual benefits 
to the 
parties, 
 namely, 
the degassing of our 
coal mining operations 
in the mine, 
which helps assure the 
safety of mine personnel, 
and the 
 Gas Party s 
commercial capture and 
sale of the 
coal gas. 
In addition, the 
Gas Party s drilling 
activities have contributed 
to 
 exploration efforts with respect to coal 
deposits at Buchanan. 
As the only natural gas supplier 
in the area, we purchase our 
 requirements of natural gas for the operation of our thermal dryer at Buchanan from the Gas Party. 

 Before Coronado 
took over 
mining operations 
at Buchanan, 
CONSOL Energy 
had conducted 
extensive exploration 
of the 
 property. 
We have 
continued exploration 
at the 
property through 
a program 
of core 
drilling to 
confirm reserves, 
establish 
 additional resources and assess the geotechnical viability of mining. 

 Buchanan produces 
primarily a 
Low-Vol 
HCC, but 
it also 
produces a 
premium Low-Vol 
PCI product. 
The Buchanan 
mine 
 extracts coal from the Pocahontas #3 seam of the Pennsylvanian-age Pocahontas Formation, which is the principal minable 
 coal seam of that formation. 
The seam is situated 
below drainage throughout the 
Property and is accessed 
by vertical shafts. 

 The seam thickness averages 1.58 meters within the mining area. 

 The Buchanan mine extracts coal using a single longwall system supported by six continuous miner sections, which develop 
 main 
entries 
and 
gate 
roads 
in 
preparation 
for 
the 
longwall. 
Each 
continuous 
miner 
section 
is 
equipped 
with 
one 
or 
two 
 continuous miners, two 
roof bolters and two 
or three coal 
haulage units. 
After extraction, a 
series of conveyor 
belts deliver 
 raw coal 
to an 
underground storage 
bunker. 
The Buchanan 
mine complex 
uses a 
skip hoist 
system to 
lift raw 
coal to 
the 
 surface. 
Buchanan has 
a CPP 
that processes 
raw coal 
at a 
rate of 
approximately 1,270 
raw tph, 
as well 
as the 
other necessary 
 support infrastructure, including loadout and portal facilities.
 Generally, 
the mining 
equipment 
and 
facilities 
at 
Buchanan 
are 
in 
good 
operating 
condition. 
We 
focus 
on 
the 
long-term 
 potential of the 
mine complex and 
regularly monitor developments 
in the mining 
industry for technology 
improvements and 
 new equipment that could 
help us increase efficiency 
and lower our costs. 
Since acquiring the Buchanan 
operations, we have 
 implemented improvements at 
the CPP, 
which have resulted 
in increased capacity. 
From time to 
time, we also 
update and 
 improve other equipment 
and facilities to 
maintain their usefulness 
and optimize our 
competitiveness. For example, 
we rebuild 
 our longwall shear, drives 
and cycling shields 
after every panel. 
We have also 
entered into life 
cycle management agreements 
 for 
our 
continuous 
miner 
equipment, 
installed 
programmable 
logic 
controller, 
or 
PLC, 
controls 
on 
the 
skip 
hoist 
system, 
 upgraded our 
belt drives 
for increased 
horsepower, deployed 
state-of-the-art Fletcher 
roof bolters 
on our continuous 
miner 
 sections 
and 
switched 
to 
PLC 
control 
systems 
and 
variable 
frequency 
drive, 
or 
VFD, 
starters 
on 
our 
belt 
drives. 
As 
of 
 December 31, 2022, the book value of Buchanan and its associated plant and equipment was 387.6 million.
 We are not aware of any significant 
encumbrances or defects in title 
with respect to the Property. 
Additionally, we believe we 
 have obtained 
all requisite 
mining and 
discharge permits 
to conduct 
our operations 
at Buchanan 
and expect 
to be 
able to 
 obtain all 
required permits 
in the 
future. The 
Buchanan mine 
complex holds 
one state 
permit, with 
the associated 
NPDES 
 permit. 

 Buchanan is subject to a federal black lung excise tax of 1.21 per ton for underground mining and a federal reclamation tax 
 of 0.13 
per ton for 
underground mining. 
However, the 
federal black lung 
excise tax 
applies only with 
respect to coal 
sold 
 domestically. 
Additionally, Buchanan is subject to a Virginia reclamation tax of 0.05 per ton (which amount is contributed to 
 a state-funded bond pool) and a Virginia severance tax of 2 for all coal sold. See Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters 
 United States for a discussion of the permitting conditions applicable to Buchanan.

Pricing data as provided 
by Coronado is described 
in Section 16.2 of 
the Buchanan TRS. 
For Buchanan reserves as 
of December 
 31, 2021, the pricing data assumes a weighted average domestic and 
international FOB-mine price of approximately 197 per Mt 
 for calendar 
year 2022; 
the weighted 
average price 
decreases to 
approximately 118 
to 
 126 
per Mt 
through year 
2026 and 
 averages approximately 152 per Mt over 
the LOM. 
For Buchanan reserves as of December 
31, 2022, the pricing 
data assumes 
 a weighted average 
domestic and international 
FOB-mine price of 
approximately 179 per 
Mt for calendar 
year 2023; the weighted 
 average price decreases to approximately 132 to 143 per Mt through year 2027 and averages approximately 153 per Mt over 
 the LOM.

to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, 
numerical figures shown as 
 totals may not equal the sum of the figures that 
precede them.
 From December 
31, 2021 
to December 
31, 2022, 
total reserves decreased 
by approximately 
5 , from approximately 
98.0 
 MMt to approximately 93.0 MMt. 
This net reduction of 5.0 MMt of total reserves was attributable 
to a combination of updates 
 to the mine plan along with one year of mining depletion. A TRS with respect to Buchanan, updating the TRS with respect to 
 Buchanan 
filed 
with 
Coronado s 
Annual 
Report 
on 
Form 
10-K 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2021, 
was 
prepared 
in 
 February 
2023 
due 
to 
material 
differences 
in 
the 
key 
financial 
modifying 
factors, 
including coal 
sales 
price 
assumptions, 
 operating costs and capital costs from 
December 31, 2021 to December 31, 
2022. Coal sales price assumptions underlying 
 the reserve 
estimates are 
discussed in 
Sections 12 
and 16 
of the 
Buchanan TRS, 
while operating 
costs and 
capital costs 
 assumptions underlying the reserve 
estimates are discussed in 
Sections 18 and 19 
of the Buchanan TRS. 
The differences 
 in the 
key financial 
modifying factors 
did not 
have a 
material impact 
on the 
reserve estimates 
from December 
31, 2021 
to 
 December 
31, 
2022. 
From 
December 
31, 
2021 
to 
December 
31, 
2022, 
measured 
and 
indicated 
resources 
increased 
 significantly, 
by approximately 167 , 
due to 
evaluation of 
additional gas 
well data in 
the North where 
none had 
previously 
 been analyzed. 
Updated financial 
inputs, including 
coal sales 
price assumptions 
and operating 
and capital 
costs used 
in 
 estimating the resources exclusive of reserves, as discussed in 
Section 11.3.1 of the Buchanan TRS, did not have a material 
 impact on 
the measured 
and indicated 
resource estimates 
as of 
December 31, 
2022, as 
compared to 
the measured 
and 
 indicated resource estimates as of 
December 31, 2021. Net increase resulted 
in an additional 25 MMt of 
in-place resources 
 in the North.
 Marshall Miller Associates, Inc., a third-party firm comprising mining experts, 
whom we refer to as the U.S. QPs, prepared 
 the estimates of 
coal resources and 
reserves as of December 
31, 2022 summarized 
in Tables 
6 and 7. 
A copy of the 
U.S. 
 QPs TRS 
with respect to 
Buchanan, dated 
as of 
February 15, 2023, 
or the 
Buchanan TRS, 
is filed 
as Exhibit 96.2 
hereto. 
 The U.S. QPs are not affiliated with Coronado.

 The 
U.S. 
QPs 
prepared 
the 
estimates 
of 
coal 
resources 
and 
reserves 
using 
core 
drilling 
data 
available 
from 
exploration 
 activities at 
Buchanan conducted 
by numerous 
entities over 
time. 
Most of 
this information 
was obtained 
prior to 
our acquisition 
 of the 
property, 
using varying drilling 
and core-logging 
techniques, survey methods 
and testing procedures. 
As a result, 
in 
 verifying the data, 
the U.S. QPs 
made certain assumptions 
about the adequacy 
of the processes 
performed and comparability 
 of the data based on their professional experience and familiarity with Buchanan. 
 Per Section 12.1 of the Buchanan TRS, coal reserves were classified as proven or probable considering modifying factors, 
 including mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. 
Section 22.2 of 
 the Buchanan TRS includes 
a risk assessment of the 
key modifying factors that could 
potentially impact the operations 
and 
 therefore the estimate of coal reserves and resources. 
 As summarized 
in Section 
7.1 in 
the Buchanan 
TRS, the 
U.S. QPs 
utilized 4,589 
available core, 
rotary, 
channel samples, 
 mine 
measurements 
and 
coalbed 
methane 
wells 
on 
and 
around 
the 
Buchanan 
property. 
Points 
of 
observation 
include 
 exploration drill 
holes, degas 
holes, and 
mine measurements, 
which have 
been fully 
vetted and 
processed into 
a geologic 
 model. 
The geologic model is based on seam depositional modeling, the interrelationship of 
overlying and underlying strata 
 on seam mineability, seam thickness trends, the impact of seam structure (i.e., faulting), intra-seam characteristics, etc. 
The 
 U.S. QPs completed a geostatistical analysis on drill holes within the reserve boundaries to determine the applicability of the 
 common United States classification system for 
measured and indicated coal resources. 
Historically, 
the United States has 
 assumed that coal within 0.4 
kilometers of a point of 
observation represents a measured resource, 
whereas coal between 0.4 
 kilometers and 
1.2 kilometers 
from a 
point of 
observation is 
classified as 
indicated. 
Inferred resources 
are commonly 
assumed 
 to be located between 1.2 
kilometers and 4.8 kilometers from 
a point of observation. The 
U.S. QPs performed a geostatistical 
 analysis of the Buchanan data set using 
the Drill Hole Spacing Analysis, or DHSA, 
method. DHSA prescribes that measured, 
 indicated 
and 
inferred 
drill 
hole 
spacings 
be 
determined 
at 
the 
10 , 
20 , 
and 
50 
levels 
of 
relative 
error, 
respectively. 
 Comparing the results of 
the DHSA to 
the historical standards, 
it is evident that 
the historical standards 
are more conservative 
 than 
even 
the 
most 
conservative 
DHSA 
model 
with 
regards to 
determining 
measured 
resources. 
The 
Exponential 
model 
 included in the DHSA 
recommends using a radius 
of 0.67 kilometers 
for measured resources 
compared to the historical 
value 
 of 
0.4 
kilometers. 
With 
respect 
to 
indicated 
resources 
the 
DHSA 
falls 
in 
line 
closely 
with 
the 
historical 
standards. 
The 
 Exponential and Spherical models of the DHSA recommend using a radius of 1.08 kilometers from a point of observation for 
 indicated resources, while 
the Gaussian model included 
in the DHSA 
recommends a radius 
of 1.10 kilometers 
from a point 
 of observation for indicated resources. These values line up closely with the historical radius of 1.2 kilometers. These results 
 have led 
the U.S. 
QPs to 
report the 
data following 
the historical 
classification standards, 
rather than 
use the 
results of 
the 
 DHSA.
 Coal quality is instrumental 
in determining the viability 
of a coal deposit. 
Per Section 8.2 of 
the Buchanan TRS, 
coal quality 
 conforms to the American Society 
for Testing and Materials, or ASTM, standards. These quality 
attributes aided in converting 
 dry, in-place tons to demonstrated coal reserves (recoverable washed tons). 
The reserve and resource criteria are 
presented 
 in 
Table 
11-1 
of 
the 
Buchanan 
TRS, 
including 
assumptions 
related 
to 
seam 
density, 
minimum 
cut-off 
thickness, 
and 
 recoveries. 

 Regarding production rates as described in 
Section 13.2 of the Buchanan TRS, 
the mine plan and productivity expectations 
 reflect historical performance and 
efforts have been 
made to adjust the 
plan to reflect 
future conditions. 
Mine development 
 and operation have not been optimized within the Buchanan TRS. 
 Logan
 Coronado s Logan property is 
currently in the production stage. 
Logan consists of four 
active underground mines (North 
Fork 
 Winifrede, 
Lower War 
Eagle, Eagle 
No. 1 
and Muddy 
Bridge) and 
supporting infrastructure 
that produce 
High-Volatile 
Met 
 coal using 
the room 
and pillar 
mining method 
and one 
active surface 
mine (Toney 
Fork) and 
supporting infrastructure 
that 
 produce both Met and thermal coal using the contour and highwall mining methods. The 
Logan complex life plan includes 12 
 proposed mines, 
consisting of 
nine underground 
mines and 
three surface 
mines. The 
property is 
located in 
Boone, Logan 
 and Wyoming Counties in southern West Virginia. 
The surface facilities are located in Logan County, 
West Virginia. 
A map 
 of Logan is shown in Figure 5.

Coronado Logan Mine Complex Property Location Map.
 The Logan mine complex 
encompasses the towns of 
Lorado and Pardee in 
Logan County, 
West Virginia, and 
Cyclone and 
 Lacoma in Wyoming County, West 
Virginia. The coordinates of the Saunders CPP are latitude 37 47' 58" and longitude 81 
 40' 
01" 
(Easting 
1,806,880 , 
Northing 
291,517 
 
in 
the 
WV 
State 
Plane 
South 
NAD

grid 
system). 
The 
nearest 
major 
 population centers are 
Huntington, West Virginia, 
and Charleston, West 
Virginia, which are 
about 145 kilometers northwest 
 and 129 
kilometers northeast 
of the 
property, 
respectively. 
From U.S. 
Route 119, 
which runs 
through Mingo, 
Logan and 
 Boone Counties to the north, a 
well-developed network of improved and unimproved 
roads provides access to the property, 
 including 
Route 
16 
and 
Route 
10, 
which 
run 
east-west 
across 
the 
property 
in 
Logan 
County 
and 
Wyoming 
County, 
 respectively. 
The Logan surface facilities 
are located approximately 21 
kilometers northeast of Man, 
West Virginia, along a 
 CSX Corporation, or CSX, rail line, 
which serves as the primary means 
of transport for produced coal. 
CSX transports coal 
 from Logan 
either to 
domestic customers 
or to 
the Kinder 
Morgan Pier 
IX and 
Dominion Terminals 
in Norfolk, 
Virginia, for 
 overseas shipment.
 Logan has 
ready access to 
water, electricity 
and personnel to 
support its operations. 
Buffalo Creek 
Public Service 
District 
 supplies water 
and American 
Electric Power 
supplies electricity 
to the 
mine complex. 
Mine personnel 
generally live 
in the 
 surrounding communities of Logan, Boone, Wyoming and Mingo Counties in West Virginia. 

 The property mineral 
rights are 
composed of 13,183 
total hectares, 13,114 of 
which are leased 
from private landholders 
under 
 approximately 15 
individual leases, 
and 69 
hectares are 
owned by 
Coronado. 
Subject to 
Coronado exercising 
its renewal 
 rights thereunder, a majority of the leases, covering a majority of the Logan reserves, expire upon exhaustion of the relevant 
 coal 
reserves, 
which 
is 
expected 
to 
occur 
in 
2056. 
One 
lease expires 
in 
2032; 
however, 
Coronado 
is 
projected 
to 
have 
 previously exhausted the reserves covered thereby.
 Under the 
terms of 
the leases, 
we are 
required to 
pay royalties 
ranging from 
3.0 to 
9.0 of 
revenue from 
sales of 
coal 
 produced depending on mining 
method. Certain of the 
leases also provide for 
 wheelage fees ranging from 
0.25 to 1.0 
 of revenue from sales of coal mined 
and removed from properties other than 
the particular leasehold and hauled across the 
 leasehold premises.
 The mining 
of Logan 
was commenced 
in 1945 
by Lorado 
Mining Company, 
or Lorado. 
Lorado was 
sold to 
Buffalo Mining 
 Company in 
1964 and 
then to Pittston 
Coal Company 
in 1971. 
Pittston operated 
the property 
until the 
early 1990 s. 
After 
 being idle for a period, the property was then sold to 
Addington Resources in 2004. 
Imagin Natural Resources acquired the 
 property in 2007 and sold 
it to Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. 
(now known as Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.) in 2011, 
which in turn sold 
 the property to Coronado in 2014. Production history 
has been approximately 1.6 MMt in 2020, 1.9 
MMt in 2021 and 2.1 MMt 
 in 2022. 
 Before 
Coronado 
acquired 
Logan, 
previous 
owners 
had 
conducted 
extensive 
exploration 
on 
the 
property. 
Coronado 
has 
 continued exploration 
at the 
property through 
a program 
of core 
drilling to 
confirm reserves, 
establish additional 
resources 
 and assess the geotechnical viability of mining. 

 Logan 
produces 
primarily 
High-Vol 
Met 
coal 
(HVA 
HCC 
and 
HVB 
HCC), 
mined 
from 
various 
seams 
of 
the 
Kanawha 
 Formation, most of which are situated below 
drainage; however, several Met coal seams are situated above drainage. 
Logan 
 also produces thermal coal from upper portions of the Kanawha Formation.

 Most of Logan s Met coal production is 
attributable to its four active underground mines, Winifrede, Lower War 
Eagle, Eagle 
 No. 1 and Muddy Bridge, each of which uses the room and 
pillar mining method. 
The North Fork Winifrede mine utilizes one 
 continuous miner 
section to 
extract coal 
from the 
Upper Winifrede 
seam, which 
is situated 
above drainage 
throughout the 
 property and accessed by drift entry. 
The Lower War Eagle mine utilizes two continuous miner 
super sections to extract coal 
 from the Lower War Eagle 
seam, which is situated 
below drainage throughout the 
property and accessed 
by slope. The Eagle 
 No. 1 mine utilizes 
three continuous miner super 
sections to extract coal 
from the No. 2 Gas 
seam, which is situated 
above 
 drainage throughout the 
property and accessed 
by drift entry. 
The Muddy Bridge 
mine utilizes two 
continuous miner super 
 sections to extract coal from the No. 2 
Gas seam, which is situated above drainage 
throughout the property and accessed by 
 drift entry.
 A majority of the 
sections of the active 
underground mines at 
Logan are configured as 
full super sections, with 
two continuous 
 miners 
per 
section. 
Each 
section 
also 
has 
two 
or 
four 
roof bolters, 
three 
or 
six 
shuttle 
cars 
and 
two 
scoops. 
From 
the 
 continuous miner at the production face, the shuttle cars haul extracted coal to 
a feeder breaker, which transfers raw coal to 
 a conveyor belt for transport to a 
surface stockpile holding area. A shared overland conveyor 
carries raw coal from the Lower 
 War Eagle mine 
to a CPP. 
Trucks haul raw coal 
from the Eagle No. 1 and 
North Fork Winifrede mines to the 
CPP and from 
 the Muddy Bridge mine to 
the Logan overland conveyor. 
The CPP has a feed 
rate capacity of 1,088 raw 
tph. 
The CPP site 
 includes raw coal storage, clean coal storage, a loadout connected to a CSX rail line and refuse disposal area. 
 The Toney 
Fork surface mine extracts Met and thermal coal using the area mining method. The current LOM plan for Toney 
 Fork also contemplates utilizing 
contour and highwall mining 
methods at various times 
during the life of 
the mine. The mine 
 uses a spread of front-end loaders, large tractors/dozers and rock trucks to remove overburden and 
expose the coal. We will 
 deploy 
highwall 
mining 
when 
overburden 
volumes 
exceed 
economical 
stripping 
ratios 
associated 
with 
area 
and 
contour 
 mining. Trucks 
haul raw 
coal from 
Toney 
Fork to 
the CPP 
site for 
cleaning or 
to the 
loading site 
to be 
shipped directly 
to 
 customers.
 Our current plans at Logan contemplate 12 proposed mines, consisting of nine underground mines and three surface mines, 
 including the five mines 
currently in operation. 
The proposed underground mines 
would extract coal using 
the room and pillar 
 mining method, and the proposed surface mines would 
extract coal using area, contour or highwall 
mining methods, or some 
 combination thereof. 
 Generally, the mining equipment and facilities at Logan are in good operating condition. 
We focus on the long-term potential 
 of 
the 
mine 
complex 
and 
regularly 
monitor 
developments 
in 
the 
mining 
industry 
for 
technology 
improvements 
and 
new 
 equipment that could 
help us increase 
efficiency and lower 
our costs. Logan s 
oldest mining equipment 
and facilities, including 
 the CPP and 
loadout facility, 
began operations in 
2008, when the Powellton 
No. 1 mine started 
production. Since acquiring 
 the Logan operations, we 
have implemented improvements at 
the CPP, which have resulted in increased 
capacity. From time 
 to 
time, 
we 
also 
update 
and 
improve 
other 
equipment 
and 
facilities 
to 
maintain 
their 
usefulness 
and 
optimize 
our 
 competitiveness. As 
of December 
31, 2022, 
the book 
value of 
Logan and 
its associated 
plant and 
equipment was 
 232.1 
 million. 
 We are not aware of any significant encumbrances or 
defects in title with respect to the property. 
Additionally, we believe we 
 have obtained all requisite mining and discharge permits to conduct our operations at Logan and expect 
to be able to obtain 
 or renew all required permits in the future. The Logan mine complex holds 24 state permits with associated NPDES permits. 

 Logan is subject to a federal black lung excise tax of 1.21 per ton for underground mining 
and 0.28 per ton for surface and 
 highwall mining; 
however, 
this tax 
applies only 
with respect 
to 
coal sold 
domestically. 
Logan is 
also subject 
to a 
federal 
 reclamation fee 
of 0.13 
per ton 
for underground 
mining and 
 0.31 per 
ton for 
surface and 
highwall mining. 
Additionally, 
 Logan is subject to 
a West Virginia 
reclamation tax of 0.308 per 
ton and a West 
Virginia severance tax of 
1.0 to 5.0 of 
 revenues for all coal produced. 
See Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters United States 
for a discussion of the 
permitting 
 conditions applicable to Logan.

respectively, through year 2050 (after 
which 
 sales prices were held constant). For 
Logan reserves as of December 31, 
2022, the pricing data assumes 
respective HVA, HVB 
 and thermal FOB-mine 
prices of approximately 
 192, 170, and 
 227 per Mt 
for calendar 
year 2023; HVA, HVB, 
and thermal prices 
 decrease to approximately 
 151, 132, and 
 83 per Mt, 
respectively, through 
year 2027, and 
then increase to 
 271, 237, and 
 150 per Mt, respectively, through year 2056.

precede them.
 From December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022, total reserves decreased by approximately 3.9 , from approximately 73.5 
 MMt to 70.6 
MMt. 
This net reduction 
of 2.9 MMt 
of total reserves 
was attributable to 
a combination of 
updates to the 
mine 
 plans along 
with one year 
of mining 
depletion. A 
TRS with 
respect to 
Logan, updating 
the TRS 
with respect 
to Logan 
filed 
 with Coronado s Annual 
Report on Form 
10-K for the 
year ended December 
31, 2021, was 
prepared in February 
2023 due 
 to 
material 
differences 
in 
the 
key 
financial 
modifying 
factors 
including 
coal 
sales 
price 
assumptions, 
operating 
costs 
and 
 capital costs from 
December 31, 2021, 
to December 31, 
2022. Coal sales 
price assumptions underlying 
the reserve estimates 
 are discussed in Sections 
12 and 16 of the 
Logan TRS, while operating 
costs and capital costs 
assumptions underlying the 
 reserve estimates 
are discussed 
in Sections 
18 and 
19 of 
the Logan 
TRS. 
The differences 
in the 
key financial 
modifying 
 factors 
did 
not 
have 
a 
material 
impact 
on 
the 
reserve 
estimates 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
as 
compared 
to 
the 
reserve 
 estimates as of 
December 31, 2021. 
From December 31, 
2021, to December 
31, 2022, measured 
and indicated resources 
 decreased by approximately 0.7 , 
from approximately 82.8 MMt 
to 82.2 MMt. This 
net reduction of 0.6 
MMt of measured 
and 
 mineral resources 
was attributable 
to one 
year of 
mining depletion 
along with 
changes to the 
mine plan. 
Updated financial 
 inputs, including coal sales price assumptions and 
operating and capital costs used in estimating 
the resources exclusive of 
 reserves, as discussed 
in Section 11.3.1 
of the Logan 
TRS, did not 
have a material 
impact on the 
measured and indicated 
 resource 
estimates 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
as 
compared 
to 
the 
measured 
and 
indicated 
resource 
estimates 
as 
of 
 December 31, 2021. 
 Marshall Miller Associates, Inc., a third-party firm comprising mining experts, 
whom we refer to as the U.S. QPs, prepared 
 the estimates of 
coal resources 
and reserves as of 
December 31, 2022 summarized 
in Tables 
8 and 9. 
A copy of the 
U.S. 
 QPs TRS with respect to Logan, dated as 
of February 15, 2023, or the Logan TRS, 
is filed as Exhibit 96.3 hereto. The 
U.S. 
 QPs are not affiliated with Coronado.
 The 
U.S. 
QPs 
prepared 
the 
estimates 
of 
coal 
resources 
and 
reserves 
using 
core 
drilling 
data 
available 
from 
exploration 
 activities at Logan conducted 
by numerous entities over 
time. 
Most of this information 
was obtained prior to 
our acquisition 
 of the 
property, 
using varying drilling 
and core-logging 
techniques, survey methods 
and testing procedures. 
As a result, 
in 
 verifying the data, 
the U.S. QPs 
made certain assumptions 
about the adequacy 
of the processes 
performed and comparability 
 of 
the 
data 
based 
on 
their 
professional 
experience 
and 
familiarity 
with 
Logan. 
Per 
Section 
12.1 
of 
the 
Logan 
TRS, 
coal 
 reserves were 
classified as 
proven or 
probable considering 
 modifying factors, 
including mining, 
metallurgical, economic, 
 marketing, legal, environmental, social 
and governmental factors. 
Section 22.2 of the 
Logan TRS includes a 
risk assessment 
 of 
the 
key 
modifying 
factors 
that 
could 
potentially 
impact the 
operations 
and 
therefore 
the 
estimate 
of 
coal 
reserves 
and 
 resources.

 As summarized in 
Section 7.1 in the 
Logan TRS, the U.S. 
QPs utilized 1,131 available 
core, rotary, 
and gas well drilling 
on 
 and around the Logan property. 
Points of observation include exploration drill holes, 
degas holes, and mine measurements, 
 which 
have 
been 
fully 
vetted 
and 
processed 
into 
a 
geologic 
model. 
The 
geologic 
model 
is 
based 
on 
seam 
depositional 
 modeling, the interrelationship 
of overlying and underlying 
strata on seam mineability, 
seam thickness trends, 
the impact of 
 seam structure (i.e., faulting), intra-seam characteristics, etc. 
The U.S. QPs completed a geostatistical analysis on 
drill holes 
 within the reserve boundaries to determine the applicability of the common United States classification system for measured 
 and 
indicated 
coal 
resources. 
Historically, 
the 
United 
States 
has 
assumed 
that 
coal 
within 
0.4 
kilometers 
of 
a 
point 
of 
 observation 
represents 
a 
measured 
resource 
whereas 
coal 
between 
0.4 
kilometers 
and 
1.2 
kilometers 
from 
a 
point 
of 
 observation is classified as indicated. 
Inferred resources are commonly assumed to be located 
between 1.2 kilometers and 
 4.8 kilometers from a point of observation. The U.S. QPs performed a geostatistical analysis of the Logan data set using the 
 DHSA method. DHSA prescribes measured, indicated, and 
inferred drill hole spacings be determined at 
the 10 , 20 , and 
 50 levels of relative error, respectively. 
Comparing the results of the DHSA to the historical standards, it is evident that the 
 historical 
standards 
are 
more 
conservative 
than 
even 
the 
most 
conservative 
DHSA 
model 
with 
regards 
to 
determining 
 measured 
resources. The 
Exponential and 
Spherical models 
recommend using 
a 
radius of 
0.87 kilometers 
for measured 
 resources 
compared 
to 
the 
historical 
value 
of 
0.4 
kilometers. 
With 
respect 
to 
indicated 
resources 
the 
Spherical 
and 
 Exponential models recommend using a radius 
1.53 kilometers. 
The historical radius of 1.2 
kilometers is therefore also more 
 conservative than the DHSA results for 
indicated resources. 
These results have led the U.S. 
QPs to report the data following 
 the historical classification standards, rather than use the results of the DHSA.
 Coal 
quality 
is 
instrumental 
in 
determining 
the 
viability 
of 
a 
coal 
deposit. 
Per 
Section 
8.2 of 
the 
Logan 
TRS, 
coal 
quality 
 conforms 
to 
the 
ASTM 
standards. 
These 
quality 
attributes 
aided 
in 
converting 
dry, 
in-place 
tons 
to 
demonstrated 
coal 
 reserves 
(recoverable 
washed 
tons). 
The 
reserve 
and 
resource 
criteria 
are 
presented 
in 
Table 
11-1 
of 
the 
Logan 
TRS, 
 including 
assumptions 
related 
to 
seam 
density, 
minimum 
cutoff 
thickness, 
and 
recoveries. 
Pricing 
data 
as 
provided 
by 
 Coronado is described in Section 16.2 of the Logan TRS. 

 Regarding production 
rates as 
described in 
Section 13.2 
of the 
Logan TRS, 
the projected 
underground mines 
are set 
up 
 similarly to the four 
active underground operations as 
of December 31, 2022. 
Each mine is scheduled 
to operate one to 
three 
 production sections. 
A majority of the sections are configured as full super sections with two continuous miners 
per section. 

 Three 
surface resource 
areas were 
modeled. 
Mining 
operations are 
projected to 
utilize area, 
as well 
as contour, 
mining 
 methods. 
The three areas 
planned for highwall 
mining are assumed 
to be mined 
by a contractor; 
therefore, the contractor 
 costs 
included 
in 
the 
financial 
model 
assume 
that 
the 
contractor 
is 
responsible 
for 
staffing 
those 
operations 
along 
with 
 providing necessary equipment 
capital. Spoil for 
final highwall reclamation is 
expected to come 
from strategic placement of 
 spoil on pre-existing benches by haul trucks such that they are within the push distance of the reclamation dozer. 
Additional 
 information regarding mine-specific production factors can be found in Section 13.4 of the Logan TRS. 
 Mon Valley
 The 
Mon 
Valley 
mine 
complex 
comprises 
three 
development-stage 
mining 
properties, 
namely, 
Pangburn, 
Shaner 
and 
 Fallowfield, each consisting of a proposed underground 
mine that would produce High-Vol Met coal using the room and pillar 
 mining method. 
The preliminary design for the properties also includes plans for surface facilities and a preparation plant 
for 
 each mine. 
The properties reside 
in Allegheny, Washington and Westmoreland Counties in 
southwestern Pennsylvania. 
The 
 proposed 
facilities 
include 
a 
barge 
loading 
dock 
and 
CSX 
rail 
loadout 
on 
the 
Monongahela 
River 
in 
Allegheny 
County, 
 Pennsylvania, which would ship 
clean coal from all three 
mines to end customers. 
A map of Mon Valley 
is shown in Figure 
 6.

 Mon 
Valley 
is 
located 
approximately 
22.5 
kilometers 
southeast 
of 
Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania, 
near 
the 
communities 
of 
 Bentleyville, 
Lockview, 
Monongahela, 
Elizabeth, 
Sutersville 
and 
Irwin, 
Pennsylvania. 
The 
coordinates 
of 
the 
proposed 
 infrastructure are latitude 40 
15' 24" and longitude 
79 53' 50" 
(Easting 1,398,821 , Northing 343,480 
 in the 
PA State Plane 
 South NAD 27 
grid system). From 
U.S. Interstate 
70 and Pennsylvania 
Route 51, which 
traverse the 
Fallowfield and Pangburn 
 areas, respectively, a well-developed network of improved and 
unimproved roads allows general access 
to the property. 
The 
 Monongahela and 
Youghiogheny 
Rivers also 
run through 
the property. 
The primary 
means of 
transport for 
produced coal 
 would be by barge on the Monongahela River/Ohio River 
system. 
Additionally, a CSX rail line located along the banks of the 
 Monongahela River would provide another option for the shipment of coal.
 Mon Valley has sources of water, power, 
and supplies readily available for use. 
Personnel in the area have historically been 
 sourced from the 
surrounding communities in 
Allegheny, 
Washington, and 
Westmoreland Counties, and 
have proven to 
be 
 adequate in numbers to 
operate the mines. 
As mining is 
common in the surrounding 
areas, the workforce 
is generally familiar 
 with mining practices, and many are 
experienced miners. 
Water is expected to be sourced locally from 
a nearby public water 
 sources 
or 
rivers. 
Electricity 
is 
anticipated 
to 
be 
sourced 
from 
West 
Penn 
Power. 
The 
service 
industry 
in 
the 
areas 
 surrounding the proposed mine complex has historically provided supplies, equipment repairs and fabrication, etc. 
 The property mineral rights are composed of 41,615 
total hectares, of which 1,339 are leased from 
private landholders under 
 two leases, and 
40,276 hectares are 
owned by Coronado. 
Subject to 
Coronado s exercising its 
renewal rights thereunder, 
 both of the leases expire upon exhaustion of the relevant coal reserves, which is expected to occur in 2100. 

 A predecessor of CONSOL 
Energy previously controlled the 
properties. 
We acquired the properties 
from CONSOL Energy 
 in March 2016 in connection with the acquisition of the Buchanan property.
 Before we acquired Mon 
Valley, 
CONSOL Energy had conducted 
extensive exploration of Mon 
Valley. 
We have continued 
 an exploration program focused on defining reserves and assessing the geotechnical viability of mining. 

 Mon Valley 
is capable 
of producing 
primarily a 
High-Vol 
Met coal 
from the 
Upper Freeport 
seam of 
the Pennsylvania-age 
 Allegheny Formation. 
The seam 
is situated 
below drainage 
throughout the 
properties and 
would be 
accessed with 
slopes 
 and shafts. 
The seam thickness in the projected mining areas averages 1.95 meters. 

 Under our current 
mine development plans, 
production would begin 
at the Pangburn 
mine in 2032, 
followed by the 
Shaner 
 mine in 2038 
and, finally, 
the Fallowfield mine 
in 2057. 
The proposed Mon 
Valley 
underground mines would 
use the room 
 and pillar 
mining method 
with limited 
pillaring as 
to cause 
no subsidence. 
Each mine 
would have 
three continuous 
miner 
 sections, with two continuous miners, two roof bolters, 
four shuttle cars and two scoops per section. 
The shuttle cars would 
 haul extracted coal 
from the production 
face to a 
feeder breaker-conveyor system, 
which would carry 
raw coal to 
a surface 
 stockpile and CPP. 
The CPPs and surface facilities would have large raw 
and clean coal storage areas to facilitate efficient 
 loading of clean coal into 
barges or rail cars for 
transport. 
We have not yet 
completed detailed designs of the 
infrastructure 
 or surface facilities for the proposed Shaner and Fallowfield mines.
 As of December 31, 2022, the book value of Mon Valley was 17.4 million.
 We 
are not 
aware 
of 
any significant 
encumbrances or 
defects 
in 
title 
with 
respect to 
the properties. 
However, 
we will 
be 
 required 
to obtain 
alternate zoning 
approval 
from the 
local township. 
Further, 
we will 
be required 
to submit 
formal permit 
 applications to state or federal regulatory agencies. 
Although we have commenced the work to 
obtain the necessary permits 
 and 
zoning 
variances, 
we 
are 
aware 
that 
the 
period 
of 
time 
necessary 
to 
obtain 
final 
authorizations, 
for 
purposes 
of 
 commencing the development, construction and ultimate production at the proposed mine site, may be significant, and there 
 can be 
no assurance 
that we 
can obtain 
the necessary 
zoning and 
permits. See 
Item 1. 
 Business Regulatory Matters 
 United States for a discussion of the permitting conditions applicable to Mon Valley. 

 Coal 
mined 
from 
the 
Mon 
Valley 
mine 
complex 
would 
be 
subject 
to 
a 
federal 
black 
lung 
excise 
tax 
of 
 1.21 
per 
ton 
for 
 underground mining and a federal reclamation tax of 0.13 per ton for underground mining. 
However, the federal black lung 
 excise tax will only apply with respect to coal sold domestically.
 Mon Valley contains no resources exclusive of reserve tons as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Table 1-1 of the Mon Valley 
 TRS provides a summary of Mon Valley resource tons inclusive of reserve tons as of December 31, 2022.

 Marshall 
Miller 
 Associates, 
Inc., 
a 
third-party 
firm comprising 
mining, 
whom we 
refer to 
as 
the U.S. 
QPs, prepared 
the 
 estimates of coal reserves summarized in Tables 10. 
A copy of the U.S. QPs TRS 
with respect to Mon Valley (Pennsylvania 
 Upper Freeport 
Holdings), dated as 
of February 15, 
2023, or the 
Mon Valley 
TRS, is filed 
as Exhibit 
96.4 hereto. The 
U.S. 
 QPs are not affiliated with Coronado.
 The 
U.S. 
QPs 
prepared 
the 
estimates 
of 
coal 
resources 
and 
reserves 
using 
core 
drilling 
data 
available 
from 
exploration 
 activities 
at 
Mon 
Valley 
conducted 
by 
numerous 
entities 
over 
time. 
Most 
of 
this 
information 
was 
obtained 
prior 
to 
our 
 acquisition of the Property, using varying drilling and core-logging techniques, survey methods and testing procedures. 
As a 
 result, in 
verifying the 
data, the 
U.S. QPs 
made certain 
assumptions about 
the adequacy 
of the 
processes performed 
and 
 comparability of the data based on their professional experience and familiarity with Mon Valley. 

 Per Section 12.1 of the Mon 
Valley TRS, coal reserves were classified as proven or 
probable considering modifying factors, 
 including mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. 
Section 22.2 of 
 the Mon Valley TRS includes a risk assessment of the key modifying factors that could potentially 
impact the operations and 
 therefore the estimate of coal reserves and resources. 
 As summarized in Section 
7.1 in the 
Mon Valley TRS, the U.S. 
QPs utilized approximately 
750 available core and 
rotary holes 
 on 
and 
around 
the 
Mon 
Valley 
properties. 
Points 
of 
observation 
include 
exploration 
drill 
holes, 
degas 
holes, 
and 
mine 
 measurements, which have 
been fully vetted 
and processed into 
a geologic model. 
The geologic model 
is based on 
seam 
 depositional modeling, 
the interrelationship 
of overlying 
and underlying 
strata on 
seam mineability, 
seam thickness 
trends, 
 the impact of seam structure (i.e. faulting), intra-seam characteristics, etc. 
The U.S. QPs completed a geostatistical analysis 
 on drill holes within the 
reserve boundaries to determine the applicability of 
the common United States classification system 
 for measured and indicated coal 
resources. 
Historically, the United 
States has assumed that coal 
within 0.4 kilometers of a 
 point of observation represents a measured resource whereas coal between 0.4 kilometer and 1.2 kilometers from a point of 
 observation is classified as indicated. 
Inferred resources are commonly assumed to be located 
between 1.2 kilometers and 
 4.8 kilometers 
from a 
point of 
observation. The 
U.S. QPs 
performed a 
geostatistical analysis 
of the 
Pennsylvania data 
set 
 using the 
DHSA method. 
DHSA prescribes 
measured, indicated, 
and inferred 
drill hole 
spacings be 
determined at 
the 10-
 percent, 20-percent, and 50-percent levels of relative error, respectively. 
Comparing the results of the DHSA to the historical 
 standards, it is evident 
that the historical standards 
are more conservative than 
even the most 
conservative DHSA model with 
 regards 
to 
determining 
measured 
resources. 
The 
Gaussian 
and 
Spherical 
models 
recommend 
using 
a 
radius 
of 
0.72 
 kilometers for 
measured resources 
compared to the 
historical value of 
0.4 kilometers. 
With respect 
to indicated 
resources 
 the 
DHSA 
falls 
in 
line 
closely 
with 
the 
historical 
standards. 
The 
Exponential 
model 
recommends 
using 
a 
radius 
1.43 
 kilometers, while 
the Spherical 
and Gaussian 
models recommend 
a radius 
of 1.42 
kilometers, respectively. 
These values 
 line up closely 
with the historical 
radius of 1.2 
kilometers. 
These results have 
led the U.S. 
QPs to report 
the data following 
 the historical classification standards, rather than use the results of the DHSA.
 Coal quality is instrumental in determining the viability of 
a coal deposit. Per Section 8.2 of the Mon 
Valley TRS, coal quality 
 conforms to the 
ASTM standards. 
These quality 
attributes aided 
in converting dry, in-place 
tons to 
demonstrated coal reserves 
 (recoverable washed tons). The reserve 
and resource criteria are presented 
in Table 
11-1 of the 
Mon Valley 
TRS, including 
 assumptions related 
to seam 
density, 
minimum cutoff 
thickness, and 
recoveries. Pricing 
data as 
provided by 
Coronado is 
 described in Section 16.2 of the Mon Valley TRS. 

 Regarding production 
rates as 
described in 
Section 13.2 
of the 
Mon Valley 
TRS, the 
Mon Valley 
mine complex 
is not 
yet 
 active, with 
three distinct 
mines and 
CPPs planned. 
The mine 
plan and 
productivity expectations 
reflect historical 
performance 
 from other 
similar mines 
with similar 
conditions and 
efforts have 
been made 
to adjust 
the plan 
to reflect 
future conditions. 
 Mine development and 
operation have not been 
optimized within the Mon 
Valley 
TRS. 
Additional mine-specific factors can 
 be found in Section 13.4 of the Mon Valley TRS.

Risks and opportunities.
 The pricing information used 
for preliminary resource valuation 
and to estimate our 
proven and probable coal 
reserves was 
 based on 
prices under 
our existing 
contracts and 
price forecasts. 
Below is 
a description 
of some 
of the 
factors that 
could 
 affect price forecasts 
for Met 
and thermal 
coal products 
on a 
mine-by-mine and 
product-by-product basis. 
Differences between 
 the assumptions and analyses included 
in the price forecasts 
and realized factors could cause 
actual pricing to differ from 
the 
 forecasts.
 Metallurgical.
 
Several 
factors 
can 
influence 
Met 
coal 
supply 
and 
demand 
and 
pricing. 
Demand 
is 
impacted 
by 
economic 
 conditions and demand for steel 
and is also impacted by competing 
technologies used to make steel, some 
of which do not 
 use coal as a 
manufacturing input. Competition 
from other types 
of coal is 
also a key price 
consideration and can be 
impacted 
 by coal quality and characteristics, delivered 
energy cost (including transportation costs), customer service 
and support and 
 reliability of supply.
 Seaborne Met 
coal import 
demand can 
be significantly 
impacted by 
the availability 
of local 
coal production, 
particularly in 
 leading Met coal 
import countries such 
as China and 
India, among others, 
as well as 
country-specific policies 
restricting or 
 promoting 
domestic supply. 
The competitiveness 
of seaborne 
Met coal 
supply 
from 
leading Met 
coal 
exporting countries, 
 such as Australia, the United States, Russia, Canada and Mongolia, among others, is also an important price consideration.
 In 
addition 
to 
the 
factors 
noted 
above, 
the 
prices 
which 
may 
be 
obtained 
at 
each 
individual 
mine 
or 
future 
mine 
can 
be 
 impacted by factors such as (i) the 
mine s location, which impacts the total delivered 
energy costs to its customers, (ii) 
quality 
 characteristics, particularly 
if they 
are unique 
relative to 
competing mines, 
(iii) assumed 
transportation costs 
and (iv) 
other 
 mine costs that are contractually passed on to customers in certain commercial relationships.
 Thermal.
 
Several factors 
can influence 
thermal coal 
supply and 
demand and 
pricing. Demand 
is sensitive 
to total 
electric 
 power generation volumes, which are determined in part by the impact of weather on heating and cooling demand, inter-fuel 
 competition in the electric power generation mix, changes in capacity (additions and retirements), inter-basin or inter-country 
 coal 
competition, 
coal 
stockpiles 
and 
policy 
and 
regulations. 
Supply 
considerations 
impacting 
pricing 
include 
reserve 
 positions, mining methods, strip ratios, production costs 
and capacity and the cost of new 
supply (new mine developments or 
 extensions at existing mines).
 The cost information that the QPs used for preliminary resource valuation and to estimate our proven and probable reserves 
 were 
generally 
internal 
projected 
future 
costs 
based 
on 
historical 
costs 
and 
expected 
future 
trends. 
The 
estimated 
costs 
 normally include 
mining, processing, 
transportation, royalty, 
tax and 
other mining-related 
costs. Our 
estimated mining 
and 
 processing costs reflect projected changes in prices of 
consumable commodities (mainly diesel fuel, natural gas, explosives 
 and steel), labor costs, geological 
and mining conditions, targeted 
product qualities and other 
mining-related costs. Estimates 
 for other sales-related 
costs (mainly transportation, 
royalty and tax) 
are based on 
contractual prices 
or fixed rates. 
Specific 
 factors that may impact the cost at our various operations include:
 
 Geological settings.
 
The geological 
characteristics of 
each mine 
are among 
the most 
important factors 
that determine 
 the mining cost. Our geology department conducts 
the exploration program and provides geological models for 
the 
 life-of-mine process. Coal seam depth, thickness, dipping angle, partings and quality constrain the available mining 
 methods and 
size of 
operations. Shallow 
coal is 
typically mined 
by surface 
mining methods 
by which 
the primary 
 cost is overburden removal. 
Deep coal is typically mined 
by underground mining methods where 
the primary costs 
 include coal extraction, conveyance and roof control.
 
 Scale of operations 
and the equipment 
sizes.
 
For surface mines, 
our dragline systems 
generally have a 
lower unit 
 cost 
than 
truck-and-shovel 
systems 
for 
overburden 
removal. 
The 
longwall 
operations 
generally 
are 
more 
cost 
 effective than bord-and-pillar operations for underground mines.
 
 Commodity 
prices.
 
For surface 
mines, the 
costs of 
diesel fuel 
and explosives 
are major 
components 
of the 
total 
 mining cost. 
For underground 
mines, the 
steel used 
for roof 
bolts represents 
a significant 
cost. Commodity 
price 
 forecasts are used to project those costs in the financial models we use to establish our reserves.
 
 Target 
product 
quality.
 
By 
targeting 
a 
premium 
quality, 
product, 
our 
mining 
and 
processing 
processes 
may 
 experience more coal 
losses. By lowering product 
quality, 
the coal losses 
can be minimized 
and therefore a 
lower 
 cost per 
Mt can 
be achieved. 
In our 
mine plans, 
the product 
qualities are 
estimated to 
correspond to 
existing contracts 
 and forecasted market demands.
 
 Transportation 
costs.
 
We 
have 
entered 
into 
arrangements 
with 
third 
parties 
to 
gain 
access 
to 
transportation 
 infrastructure and 
services where required, 
including rail carriers 
and port owners. 
Where coal is 
exported or sold 
 other than at the mine gate, 
the costs associated with these 
arrangements represent a significant portion of 
both the 
 total cost 
of supplying 
coal to 
customers and 
of our 
production costs. 
As a 
result, the 
cost of 
transportation is 
not 
 only a key factor in our cost base but also in the purchasing decision of customers. 
Our transportation costs vary by 
 region. See Item 1. Business Transportation 
for more information regarding transportation arrangements for 
our 
 operations.

 Royalty costs.
 
As conditions to certain of the Tenements, Curragh is subject to royalties payable to the Queensland 
 government 
as 
described 
in 
Item 
1. 
 Business Regulatory 
Matters Australia Mineral 
Resources 
Act 
1989 
 (Qld) ). 
These 
royalties 
are 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
Stanwell 
rebate, 
as 
described 
in 
Item 
1. 
 Business Customers 
 Australia 
Sales 
and 
Marketing Stanwell. 
Royalty 
costs 
at 
our 
U.S. 
Operations 
are 
based 
upon 
contractual 
 agreements for the coal leased from private owners and vary 
from property to property and by the type of 
mine (i.e., 
 surface or underground). The 
royalty rates under leases 
at our U.S. Operations 
range between 3 - 
9 of revenues 
 from coal 
sales. Under 
some of 
the leases, 
we are 
required to 
pay minimum 
royalties, regardless 
of 
production, 
 and/or 
 wheelage 
fees 
(i.e., fees 
payable 
on 
coal 
mined 
and 
removed 
from 
properties 
other 
than 
the 
particular 
 leasehold and hauled across the leasehold premises).
 
 Black lung, severance and reclamation taxes.
 
Our U.S. Operations are subject to a federal black lung excise tax on 
 coal sold domestically.
 
 Exchange rates.
 
Costs related 
to our 
Australian Operations 
are predominantly 
denominated in 
A , while 
the coal 
 that our Australian Operations export is sold in 
US . As a result, A -US exchange rates 
impact the U.S. dollar cost 
 of our Australian Operations production.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION 
AND ANALYSIS 
OF FINANCIAL 
CONDITION AND 
RESULTS 
OF 
 OPERATIONS 
 The following 
Management s Discussion 
and Analysis 
of our Financial 
Condition and 
Results of 
Operations, or 
 MD A, should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes to those 
 statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 
10-K. 

 Overview 
 For the year ended December 31, 
2022, we produced 16.0
 MMt and sold 16.4 MMt of 
coal. Met coal and thermal 
 coal sales 
represented 
77.2 
and 22.8 , 
respectively, 
of our 
total volume 
of coal 
sold and 
95.3 and 
4.7 , 
 respectively, of total 
coal revenues. 

 During the year 
ended December 31, 
2022, seaborne index 
prices reached record 
highs globally, 
driven by the 
 continued impact 
of the 
Russian invasion 
of Ukraine, 
which removed 
Russian Met 
coal from 
key markets, 
Met 
 coal crossover trades 
into thermal market 
due to 
elevated demand for 
thermal coal and 
supply constraints caused 
 by wet weather and logistical issues. 
 Coronado has 
continued to 
take advantage 
of its 
unique geographical 
diversification as 
a Met 
coal supplier 
of 
 scale to meet the requirements of steel customers across the globe. Our U.S. Operations have taken advantage 
 of current unique market fundamentals created 
by the trade restrictions on Russian coal 
by switching coal sales 
 from 
China 
to 
Europe 
providing 
higher 
returns 
for 
our 
products. 
In 
addition 
to 
geographical 
diversification, 
 Coronado is well 
positioned to take 
advantage of price 
arbitrage between the 
Thermal and Met 
coal markets to 
 maximize price realizations. 
 Our results 
of operations 
for the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2022 benefited 
from higher 
averaged realized 
Met 
 price per Mt sold, 
partially offset by (1) significant unprecedented 
wet weather events impacting production at 
our 
 Australian 
Operations, 
(2) 
inflationary 
pressure, 
including 
the 
higher 
cost 
of 
fuel 
and 
labor 
costs, 
(3) 
adverse 
 geological 
conditions 
and 
weather 
events 
at 
our 
U.S. 
Operations 
resulting 
in 
lower 
production 
and 
higher 
 equipment 
maintenance 
costs, 
(4) 
additional 
fleets 
mobilized 
at 
our 
Australian 
Operations 
to 
improve 
coal 
 recovery and (5) higher sales related costs (Stanwell rebate, 
royalties and freight costs). 

 Coal revenues of 3.5
 billion
 for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased by 67.3 compared to the same 
 period in 2021, was largely driven by higher 
market price of coal resulting in increased 
average realized Met coal 
 pricing of 265.8 per Mt sold, 
 127.8 per Mt sold higher than 2021. Sales 
volumes were lower for the year ended 
 December 
31, 
2022, 
compared 
to 
2021 
primarily 
due 
to 
lower 
production 
caused 
by 
significant 
wet 
weather 
 events at our Australian Operations and adverse geological 
conditions at our U.S. Operations. 

 Operating costs for the year 
ended December 31, 2022, 
were 680.5 million, or 
41.6 , higher compared to 
the 
 corresponding 
period 
in 
2021 
driven 
by 
inflationary 
pressures 
on 
labor 
and 
supply 
costs, 
adverse 
geological 
 conditions 
in 
certain 
mines 
of 
our 
U.S. 
Operations, 
additional 
contractor 
fleets 
deployed 
at 
our 
Australian 
 Operations to accelerate 
overburden removal and 
increase coal availability, higher maintenance 
costs and higher 
 sales related costs, resulting in mining costs of 88.4 per Mt sold for the year ended December 31, 2022, 34.5 
 higher than 2021. 
 Dividends
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, Coronado 
paid total dividends of 700.2 million to stockholders 
and 
 CDI holders on 
the ASX, net 
of 1.4 million 
foreign exchange gain on 
payment of dividends 
to certain CDI 
holders 
 that elected to be paid in Australian dollars. 
 Liquidity 
 As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
Company s 
net 
cash 
position 
was 
 92.1 
million, 
consisting 
of 
cash 
(excluding 
 restricted cash) of 334.4 million and 242.3 million aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding. Coronado 
 had available 
liquidity of 
 434.4 million

 Safety 
 For 
our 
Australian 
Operations, 
the 
twelve-month 
rolling 
average 
Total 
Reportable 
Injury 
Frequency 
Rate 
at 
 December 31, 2022 
was 3.92 compared 
to 3.07 
at the end 
of December 
31, 2021. At 
our U.S. Operations, 
the 
 twelve-month rolling average Total 
Reportable Incident Rate, at December 31, 2022 was 2.42 compared to 2.51 
 at the 
end of 
December 31, 2021. 
Reportable rates for 
our Australian Operations 
and U.S. 
Operations were below 
 the relevant industry benchmarks. 
 The safety of our workforce is 
our number one priority and we 
remain focused on the safety and 
wellbeing of all 
 employees and contracting parties. 
 Segment Reporting 
 In accordance with 
Accounting Standards Codification, 
or ASC, 280, 
Segment Reporting, we 
have adopted the 
 following reporting 
segments: Australia and 
the United 
States. In 
addition, Other and 
Corporate is 
not a 
reporting 
 segment but is disclosed for the purposes of reconciliation 
to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Results of Operations 
 How We Evaluate Our Operations 
 We 
evaluate 
our 
operations 
based 
on 
the 
volume 
of 
coal 
we 
can 
safely 
produce 
and 
sell 
in 
compliance 
with 
 regulatory 
standards, 
and 
the 
prices 
we 
receive 
for 
our 
coal. 
Our 
sales 
volume 
and 
sales 
prices 
are 
largely 
 dependent upon 
the terms 
of our 
coal sales 
contracts, for 
which prices 
generally are 
set based 
on daily 
index 
 averages, on a quarterly basis or on annual fixed price 
contracts. 
 Our management 
uses a 
variety of 
financial and 
operating metrics 
to analyze 
our performance. 
These metrics 
 are significant factors 
in assessing our 
operating results 
and profitability. 
These financial 
and operating metrics 
 include: (i) safety and environmental metrics; (ii) Adjusted EBITDA; (iii) total sales volumes and average realized 
 price 
per 
Mt 
sold, 
which 
we 
define 
as 
total 
coal 
revenues 
divided 
by 
total 
sales 
volume; 
(iv) 
Met 
coal 
sales 
 volumes and average realized Met price per 
Mt sold, which we define as Met coal 
revenues divided by Met coal 
 sales volume; (v) 
average segment mining 
costs per Mt sold, 
which we define 
as mining costs 
divided by sales 
 volumes (excluding 
non-produced coal) 
for the 
respective segment; 
and (vi) 
average segment 
operating costs 
 per Mt sold, which we define as segment operating costs 
divided by sales volumes for the respective segment. 
 Coal revenues are shown on our Consolidated Statements of Operations 
and Comprehensive Income exclusive 
 of other 
revenues. Generally, 
export sale 
contracts for 
our Australian 
Operations require 
us to 
bear the 
cost of 
 freight 
from 
our 
mines 
to 
the 
applicable 
outbound 
shipping 
port, 
while 
freight 
costs 
from 
the 
port 
to 
the 
end 
 destination are 
typically borne by 
the customer. Sales to 
the export market 
from our U.S. 
Operations are generally 
 recognized when the title to the coal passes to the customer at the mine load out similar to a domestic sale. 
For 
 our domestic sales, customers typically bear the cost of freight. As such, freight expenses are excluded from the 
 cost of coal revenues to allow for consistency and comparability 
in evaluating our operating performance. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures; Other Measures 
 The following discussion of 
our results includes 
references to and analysis 
of Adjusted EBITDA and 
mining costs, 
 which 
are 
financial 
measures 
not 
recognized 
in 
accordance 
with 
U.S. 
GAAP. 
Non-GAAP 
financial 
measures, 
 including Adjusted EBITDA, are used by investors to 
measure our operating performance. 
 Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, depletion and 
 amortization 
and 
other 
foreign 
exchange 
losses. 
Adjusted 
EBITDA 
is 
also 
adjusted 
for 
certain 
discrete 
non-
 recurring items that we exclude in 
analyzing each of our segments 
operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA 
is 
 not intended to 
serve as an 
alternative to U.S. GAAP 
measures of performance 
and may not 
be comparable to 
 similarly titled measures presented by 
other companies. A reconciliation 
of Adjusted EBITDA to its 
most directly 
 comparable measure under U.S. GAAP is included below. 

 Segment 
Adjusted 
EBITDA 
is 
defined 
as 
Adjusted 
EBITDA 
by 
operating 
and 
reporting 
segment, 
adjusted 
for 
 certain 
transactions, 
eliminations 
or 
adjustments 
that 
our 
CODM 
does 
not 
consider 
for 
making 
decisions 
to 
 allocate resources among segments or assessing segment performance. 
Segment Adjusted EBITDA is used as 
 a 
supplemental 
financial 
measure 
by 
management 
and 
by 
external 
users 
of 
our 
Consolidated 
Financial 
 Statements such 
as investors, 
industry analysts 
and lenders 
to assess 
the operating 
performance of 
the business. 
 Mining costs, 
a non-GAAP 
measure, are 
based on 
the reported 
cost of 
coal revenues, 
which is 
shown on 
our 
 statement of 
operations and comprehensive 
income exclusive of 
freight expense, Stanwell 
rebate, other royalties, 
 depreciation, 
depletion 
and 
amortization 
and 
selling, 
general 
and 
administrative 
expenses, 
adjusted 
for 
other 
 items that do not relate 
directly to the costs incurred 
to produce coal at the mine. 
Mining costs exclude these cost

 components as 
our CODM 
does not 
view these 
costs as 
directly attributable 
to the 
production of 
coal. Mining 
 costs 
is 
used 
as 
a 
supplemental 
financial 
measure 
by 
management, 
providing 
an 
accurate 
view 
of 
the 
costs 
 directly attributable to the production 
of coal at our mining 
segments, and by external 
users of our Consolidated 
 Financial Statements, 
such as 
investors, industry 
analysts and 
ratings agencies, 
to assess 
our mine 
operating 
 performance in comparison to the mine operating performance 
of other companies in the coal industry. 
 Year Ended December 31, 
2022 Compared to Year 
Ended December 31, 2021
 Summary
 The financial and operational highlights for the year ended December 
31, 2022:
 
Net income 
increased by 
 582.3 million, 
from a 
net income 
of 189.4 
million for 
the year 
ended December 
 31, 2021, 
to a 
net income 
of 771.7 
million for 
the year 
ended December 
31, 2022. 
The increase 
was 
 driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher 
operating costs and higher income tax expense.
 
Supply concerns 
in key 
Met coal markets 
driven by wet 
weather, 
logistic issues, 
the ongoing 
impact of 
 the Russia and Ukraine 
war on global coal 
supply chain and Met 
coal crossover trades into 
the thermal 
 market caused considerable 
volatility in coal pricing, 
resulting in average 
realized Met price 
per Mt sold 
 of 265.8 for the year ended December 
31, 2022, 92.6 higher
 compared to 138.0 per Mt sold for 
the 
 year ended December 31, 2021.
 
Total sales volume was 16.4 MMt for the 
year ended December 31, 2022, 
or 1.5 MMt lower 
than the year 
 ended December 
31, 2021. 
The lower 
sales volumes 
were primarily 
driven by 
significant wet 
weather 
 events 
at 
our 
Australian 
Operations 
and 
adverse 
geological 
and 
weather 
events 
at 
one 
of 
our 
mine 
 complexes at our U.S. Operations.
 
Adjusted EBITDA for the year 
ended December 31, 2022, totaled 
 1,215.6 million, an increase of 
 729.5 
 million, from Adjusted EBITDA of 486.1 million for 
the year ended December 31, 2021, driven by 
higher 
 coal revenues partially offset by higher operating 
costs.
 
Cash 
provided 
by 
operating 
activities 
was 
 926.6 million 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022, 
an 
 increase of 484.6 million 
compared to 442.0 million for the year ended 
December 31, 2021.
 
As of December 
31, 2022 the 
Company had total 
available liquidity of 
 434.4 million, consisting 
of 334.4 
 million of cash (excluding restricted cash) and 100.0 million 
of availability under the ABL Facility.

 Coal revenues
 Coal revenues 
were 3,527.6 
million 
for the 
year 
ended December 
31, 2022, 
an 
increase of 
 1,419.3 
million, 
 compared 
to 
 2,108.3 million 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2021. 
This 
increase 
was 
driven 
by 
favorable 
 market conditions and higher coal 
price indices, which resulted in 
a higher average realized Met 
price per Mt sold 
 for the year ended December 
31, 2022 of 265.8, compared 
to 138.0 per Mt sold 
for the same period in 
2021. 

 This increase was 
partially offset by 1.8 
MMt lower Met 
coal sales volume 
compared to the 
year ended December 
 31,2021, primarily a result of above average rainfall impacting 
production at our Australian Operations.
 Cost of coal revenues (exclusive of Items shown 
separately below)
 Cost of 
coal revenues is 
comprised of 
costs related to 
produced tons sold, 
along with 
changes in 
both the 
volumes 
 and carrying values of coal inventory. 
Cost of coal revenues include items 
such as direct operating costs, which 
 include employee-related costs, materials and supplies, contractor services, coal handling and preparation costs 
 and production taxes. 
 Total 
cost of coal revenues 
was 1,515.6 million for 
the year ended December 
31, 2022, an 
increase of 320.3 
 million, or 
26.8 , compared 
to 1,195.3 
million for 
the year 
ended December 
31, 2021. 
Cost of 
coal revenues 
 for our U.S. 
Operations increased 171.3 million during the 
year ended December 31, 2022, 
driven by the impact 
 of 
inflation 
on 
labor 
and 
supply 
costs, 
adverse 
geological 
conditions 
in 
certain 
mines 
of 
our 
U.S. 
Operations 
 resulting 
in 
unplanned 
maintenance 
costs, 
and 
increased 
purchased 
coal 
transactions 
to 
meet 
certain 
sales 
 commitments. 
Cost 
of 
coal 
revenues 
for 
our 
Australian 
Operations 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022 
 increased 149.1 million, largely due to additional fleets mobilized 
to accelerate overburden removal, inflationary 
 pressure on fuel pricing and labor costs and increased purchased coal transactions to meet sales commitments. 
 Higher costs 
were partially 
offset by 
a favorable 
average foreign 
exchange rate 
on translation 
of the Australian 
 Operations for 
the year 
ended December 
31, 2022, 
of A /US : 
0.70 compared 
to 0.75 
for the 
same period 
in 
 2021.

Table of Contents 
 Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December

104 
 Depreciation, depletion and amortization
 Depreciation, depletion and amortization were 167.0 million for 
the year ended December 31, 2022, 
a decrease 
 of 
 10.8 million, 
compared 
to 
 177.9 
million 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2021. 
The 
decrease 
was 
 associated with a 
favorable average foreign 
exchange rate on 
translation of the 
Australian Operations, 
partially 
 offset by depreciation on equipment brought into 
service during the year ended December 31, 2022.
 Freight expenses
 Freight expenses of 249.1 million for the year 
ended December 31, 2022, increased by 
 7.2 million, compared 
 to 241.9 
million for 
the year 
ended December 
31, 2021. 
Our U.S. 
Operations contributed 
 15.9 million 
to the 
 increase, due to certain contracts for which we arrange and pay for transportation to port that did not exist to the 
 same extent in 2022 
combined with higher rail freight 
rates due the impact of 
inflationary pressures in the market, 
 partially offset by the 
benefits of lower 
average foreign exchange 
rate on translation 
of freight cost 
from Australian 
 Operations.
 Stanwell rebate
 The Stanwell 
rebate was 
 166.0 million 
for the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2022, an 
increase of 
 110.6 million, 
 compared to 
 55.4 million 
for the 
year 
ended December 
31, 2021. 
The increase 
was largely 
driven by 
higher 
 realized 
export 
reference 
coal 
pricing 
for 
the 
prior 
twelve-month 
period 
used 
to 
calculate 
the 
rebate, 
partially 
 offset by the favorable average foreign exchange 
rate on translation of the Australian Operations.
 Other royalties
 Other 
royalties 
were 
 385.1 million 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022, 
an 
increase 
of 
 242.3 million, 
as 
 compared to 
 142.8 million 
for the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2021. 
Higher royalties 
were a 
product of 
higher 
 average 
realized 
export 
pricing 
and 
the 
adverse 
impact 
of 
the 
new 
Queensland 
Government 
royalty 
regime 
 applicable from July 1, 2022 to our Australian Operations.
 Other, net 
 Other, 
net 
was 
a 
gain 
of 
 33.8 
million 
in 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022, 
an 
increase 
of 
 40.0 
million 
 compared to 
a net 
loss of 
 6.2 million 
for the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2021. The 
increase largely 
relates to 
 foreign exchange gains 
recognized in the 
translation of short-term 
inter-entity balances in 
certain entities within 
 the 
Group 
that 
are 
denominated 
in 
currencies 
other 
than 
their 
respective 
functional 
currencies 
due 
to 
the 
 favorable average foreign exchange rate on translation. 
 Income tax expense 
 Income tax 
expense of 
 231.6 million 
for the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2022, increased 
by 178.5 
million, as 
 compared to 53.1 million for the year ended December 
31, 2021. 
 The income tax expense 
for the year ended 
December 31, 2022 resulted in 
an annual effective tax rate 
of 23.8 , 
 an increase from 21.9 for the year ended December 
31, 2021.

 Coal 
revenues 
for 
Australian 
Operations 
for 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022, 
were 
 2,078.5 million, 
an 
 increase of 798.8 million, or 62.4 , compared 
to 1,279.7 million for the year 
ended December 31, 2021. This 
 increase 
was 
driven 
by 
higher 
average 
realized 
Met 
price 
of 
 303.1 
per 
Mt, 
an 
increase 
of 
 160.0 
per 
Mt, 
 compared to 143.1 per Mt sold during the same period in 2021. The higher realized price during the period was 
 primarily driven by disruption in supply dynamics caused by the conflict between 
Russia and Ukraine, as well as 
 supply constraints from key Met 
coal markets due to unseasonal 
wet weather and logistical issues. Sales 
volume 
 of 10.0 MMt was 1.3 MMt lower compared to 11.3 
MMt for the year ended December 31, 2021, mainly driven by 
 significant unprecedented wet 
weather events experienced 
at the Curragh 
mine during 2022 
which significantly 
 reduced mining activities and coal availability.
 Operating costs increased by 464.5 million, or 41.8 , for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the 
 year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2021. 
The 
increase 
was 
driven 
by 
a 
higher 
mining 
costs, 
higher 
Stanwell 
rebate 
 (mainly due 
to higher 
realized coal 
pricing) and 
greater royalties, 
due to higher 
coal revenues 
and the 
adverse 
 impact of the amended royalty. 
Mining costs were 127.8 million, or 17.4 , higher for the year ended December 
 31, 2022 compared to the same 
period in 2021, primarily due 
to inflationary pressures and additional 
contractor 
 fleets mobilized 
during the 
first half 
of 2022 
at our 
Australian Operations, 
partially offset 
by favorable 
average 
 foreign exchange on 
translation of our 
Australian Operations. Increased 
costs combined with 
lower sales 
volumes 
 resulted in higher Mining 
and Operating costs per Mt 
sold of 89.5 and 
 158.3, respectively, an increase of 21.9 
 and 60.1, respectively, 
compared to the same period in 2021.
 For the year 
ended December 31, 
2022, Segment 
Adjusted EBITDA was 
 541.2 million, an 
increase of 336.2 
 million compared 
to Segment 
Adjusted EBITDA 
of 205.0 
million for 
the year 
ended December 
31, 2021. 
This 
 increase was primarily driven by higher coal revenues 
partially offset by higher operating costs.

 Coal revenues increased by 620.5 million, or 
74.9 , to 1,449,1 million for the 
year ended December 31, 2022, 
 as compared 
to 
 828.6 million 
for the 
year 
ended December 
31, 2021. 
This increase 
was 
mainly driven 
by 
a 
 higher average 
realized 
Met price 
per Mt 
sold for 
the 
year ended 
December 31 
, 
2022 of 
 226.5 compared 
to 
 131.2 per Mt sold for 
the same period in 2021. 
Higher average realized Met price benefited 
from strong demand 
 and supply shortage 
in the global 
seaborne export markets 
and high demand 
of U.S.-sourced coal 
into Europe 
 due to trade restrictions on Russian coal. 
 Operating costs
 increased by 215.9 million, or 41.2 , to 739.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, 
 compared to 
operating costs 
of 524.0 
million for 
the year 
ended December 
31, 2021 
driven by 
higher mining 
 costs, royalties, freight expenses 
and increase in purchase 
d 
coal to meet sales 
commitments. 
Higher operating 
 costs were largely driven 
by increase in mining 
costs of 139.5 million, 
or 35.5 . compared to 
the same period 
 in 2021, as 
a result 
of adverse 
geological conditions 
causing higher 
maintenance costs, 
higher subcontractor s 
 costs 
due to labor shortages and overall inflationary pressures 
on labor, materials and supplies.
 Segment Adjusted EBITDA of 716.7 million for 
the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by 
 404.6 million, 
 or
 129.7 , compared to 
 312.0 million for 
the year ended 
December 31, 
2021. This increase
 was primarily driven 
 by a higher average realized Met price per Mt sold, partially offset 
by higher operating costs.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources
 Overview
 Our objective is to maintain a prudent capital structure and to ensure that sufficient liquid assets and funding are 
 available to meet both anticipated and 
unanticipated financial obligations, including unforeseen events that could 
 have an 
adverse impact 
on revenues 
or costs. 
Our principal 
sources of 
funds are 
cash and 
cash equivalents, 
 cash flow from operations and availability under the ABL 
Facility. 
 Our main uses of cash have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, the funding of our operations, 
 working capital, 
capital 
expenditure, 
debt 
service 
obligations, 
business 
or assets 
acquisitions 
and 
payment 
of 
 dividends. Based on our outlook for the next 
twelve months and beyond, 
which is subject to continually changing 
 demand from our customers, volatility in 
coal prices, ongoing interruptions and uncertainties surrounding China s 
 import restrictions, 
such as 
trade barriers 
imposed by 
China on 
Australian sourced 
coal and 
the uncertainty 
of 
 impacts from the Russia and Ukraine war 
on the global supply chain, we believe 
expected cash generated from 
 operations together with available borrowing facilities 
and other strategic and financial 
initiatives, will be sufficient 
 to meet 
the needs 
of our 
existing operations, 
capital expenditure, 
service our 
debt obligations 
and, if 
declared, 
 payment of dividends.
 Our ability to generate 
sufficient cash depends 
on our future performance 
which may be subject 
to a number of 
 factors 
beyond 
our 
control, 
including 
general 
economic, 
financial 
and 
competitive 
conditions 
and 
other 
risks 
 described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual 
Report on Form 10-K. 
 Liquidity as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 
2021 was as follows:

 Liquidity
 As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
available 
liquidity 
was 
 434.4 
million, 
comprising 
of 
cash 
and 
cash 
equivalents 
 (excluding restricted cash) of 334.4 million and 100.0 
million of available borrowings under our ABL Facility.
 Coronado continues to actively 
review plans for reducing 
operating, corporate and capital 
expenditures to ensure 
 sufficient available liquidity during periods of uncertainty 
and volatility.
 Cash
 Cash is held in a 
multicurrency interest bearing bank accounts available to be 
used to service the working capital 
 needs of 
the Company. 
Cash balances 
surplus to 
immediate working 
capital requirements 
is invested 
in short-
 term interest-bearing deposit accounts or used to repay 
interest bearing liabilities.
 Senior Secured Notes
 As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding principal amount of our 10.750 
Senior Secured Notes due 2026, or 
 the Notes, 
was 242.3
 million. Interest on 
the Notes is 
payable semi-annually in 
arrears on 
May 15 and 
November 
 15 of each year. The Notes 
mature on May 15, 2026 and are senior secured obligations 
of the Company.
 The Notes are guaranteed 
on a senior secured 
basis by the Company 
and its wholly-owned 
subsidiaries (other 
 than 
the 
Issuer) 
(subject 
to 
certain 
exceptions 
and 
permitted 
liens) 
and 
secured 
by 
(i) 
a 
first-priority 
lien 
on 
 substantially all of the Company s assets and the assets of the other 
Guarantors (other than accounts receivable 
 and other rights to payment, 
inventory, 
intercompany indebtedness, certain 
general intangibles and commercial 
 tort claims, commodities accounts, deposit accounts, securities accounts and other related assets and proceeds 
 and 
products 
of 
each 
of 
the 
foregoing, 
or, 
collectively, 
the 
ABL 
Collateral), 
or 
the 
Notes 
Collateral, 
and 
(ii) 
a 
 second-priority lien on the ABL Collateral, which is 
junior to a first-priority lien, for the 
benefit of the lenders under 
 the ABL Facility.
 The terms 
of the 
Notes are 
governed 
by the 
indenture. 
The indenture 
contains 
customary 
covenants 
for high 
 yield bonds, including, 
but not limited 
to, limitations on 
investments, liens, indebtedness, 
asset sales, transactions 
 with affiliates and restricted payments, including payment 
of dividends on capital stock.
 The Company may 
redeem some or 
all of the 
Notes at the 
redemption prices and 
on the terms 
specified in the 
 Indenture. In addition, the Company may, 
from time to time, seek to retire or purchase outstanding 
debt through 
 open-market purchases, 
privately negotiated 
transactions or 
otherwise. Such 
repurchases, if 
any, 
will be 
upon 
 such terms and at such prices as the Company may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, 
 liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other 
factors.
 As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all applicable 
covenants under the Indenture.
 Partial Redemption of Notes
 On November 
23, 2022, 
the Company 
exercised its 
optional redemption 
rights and 
redeemed 35.0 
million, or 
 10.0 , of the 
original aggregate principal amount 
of its Notes 
at a redemption 
price equal to 
103 of the 
principal 
 amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on 
the Notes to, but not including, the date 
of redemption. 
 For 
the 
year 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022, 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
dividends 
paid 
in 
the 
period, 
we 
offered 
to 
 purchase the 
Notes pursuant 
to the 
terms of 
the Indenture. 
In connection 
with the 
above offers, 
we purchased 
 an 
aggregate 
principal 
amount, 
for 
accepted 
offers, 
of 
 37.7 
million 
at 
a 
price 
equal 
to 
104 
of 
the 
principal 
 amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on 
the Notes to, but not including, the date 
of redemption.

 ABL Facility
 The ABL 
Facility, 
dated May 
12, 2021, 
is for 
an aggregate 
multi-currency 
lender commitment 
of up 
to 100.0 
 million, including a 30.0 million 
sublimit for the issuance 
of letters of credit and 
 5.0 million for swingline 
loans, 
 at any time outstanding, subject to borrowing base availability. 
The ABL Facility matures on May 12, 2024. 
 Borrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest at a rate 
equal to a BBSY rate plus an applicable margin. 
 As 
at 
December 
31, 
2022, 
no 
amounts 
were 
drawn 
and 
no 
letters 
of 
credit 
were 
outstanding 
under 
the 
ABL 
 Facility. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all applicable 
covenants under the ABL Facility.
 Bank Guarantees and Surety Bonds
 We 
are 
required 
to 
provide 
financial 
assurances 
and 
securities 
to 
satisfy 
contractual 
and 
other 
requirements 
 generated in the 
normal course of 
business. Some of 
these assurances are provided 
to comply with 
state or other 
 government agencies statutes and regulations. 
 For the U.S. Operations, in 
order to provide the required 
financial assurance, we generally use 
surety bonds for 
 post-mining reclamation. 
We can 
also use 
bank letters 
of credit 
to collateralize 
certain other 
obligations. As 
of 
 December 31, 2022, we 
had outstanding surety bonds of 
 34.9 million and letters of 
credit of 16.8 million issued 
 from our available bank guarantees, to meet contractual obligations under workers compensation insurance and 
 to secure 
various 
obligations 
and commitments. 
Future 
regulatory 
changes relating 
to these 
obligations 
could 
 result in increased obligations, additional costs or additional 
collateral requirements.
 For 
the 
Australian 
Operations, 
we 
had 
bank 
guarantees 
outstanding 
of 
 27.3 
million 
at 
December 
31, 
2022, 
 primarily in respect of certain rail and port arrangements 
of the Company.
 As of 
December 31, 
2022, we 
had outstanding 
bank guarantees 
of 44.1 
million to 
secure various 
obligations 
 and 
commitments. 
The 
Company 
provided 
cash, 
in 
the 
form 
of 
deposits, 
as 
collateral 
against 
these 
bank 
 guarantees.
 Dividend
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid 700.2 
million in dividends to stockholders or CDI holders 
 on the ASX, 
net of 1.4 million foreign exchange gain on payment 
of dividends to certain CDI holders that 
 elected to be paid in Australian dollars.
 On February 21, 
2023, our Board 
of Directors declared 
a bi-annual fully 
franked fixed ordinary 
dividend of 8.4 
 million, or 0.5 cents per CDI. The Company 
is not required to make an offer 
to purchase Notes in relation to this 
 dividend due to the available unaccepted portion of the 
offer to purchase Notes made in connection with 
special 
 dividends declared on October 30, 2022. The dividend will have a record date of March 15, 2023, Australia time, 
 and be payable on April 5, 2023, Australia time. The 
ordinary dividend will be funded from available cash. 

 Capital Requirements
 Our main uses of cash have historically been the funding 
of our operations, working capital, capital expenditure, 
 the payment of 
interest and dividends. 
We intend 
to use cash 
to fund debt 
service payments 
on our Notes, 
the 
 ABL Facility and our 
other indebtedness, to fund operating 
activities, working capital, capital expenditures, partial 
 redemption of the Notes, business or assets acquisitions 
and, if declared, payment of dividends.

 Operating activities
 Net cash provided 
by operating activities 
was 926.6 million 
for the year ended 
December 31, 2022, 
compared 
 to a 
cash provided 
by in 
operating activities 
of 442.0 million for 
the year 
ended December 
31, 2021. 
The increase 
 was primarily driven by higher coal revenues due to an increase in the 
average realized Met coal pricing partially 
 offset by higher operating 
costs and unfavorable working capital 
movement due to higher trade 
receivables and 
 inventories at December 31, 2022. 
 Net cash provided 
by operating activities 
was 442.0 million 
for the year ended 
December 31, 2021, 
compared 
 to a cash used in 
operating activities of 3.0 million for the year 
ended December 31, 2020. The increase in cash 
 provided by 
operating 
activities 
was driven 
by favorable 
movement 
in working 
capital and 
an increase 
in coal 
 revenues during the year partially offset by higher 
operating costs.
 Investing activities
 Net cash 
used in 
investing activities 
was 
 208.3 million 
for the 
year 
ended December 
31, 2022, 
compared 
to 
 134.3 million 
for the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2021. Cash 
spent on 
capital expenditures 
for the

2022 
was 199.7 
million, of 
which 79. 
4 
million is 
related to 
the Australian 
Operations, 
 119.7 
 million is related 
to the U.S. 
Operations and the 
remaining 0.6 million 
for other and corporate. 
During the year 
 ended December 
31, 2022, 
a net 
of 6.5 
million of 
additional deposits 
were provided 
as collateral 
for our 
U.S. 
 workers 
compensation 
obligations 
and 
 2.4 
million 
of 
the 
additional 
security 
deposit 
were 
provided 
by 
our 
 Australian Operations to satisfy contractual requirements in 
the normal course of business.
 Net cash 
used in 
investing 
activities was 
 134.3 million 
for the 
year 
ended December 
31, 2021, 
compared 
to 
 114.1 
million for 
the year 
ended December 
31, 2020. 
Cash spent 
on capital 
expenditures for 
the year 
ended 
 December 31, 2021 was 
 89.7 million, of 
which 37.9 million is 
related to the Australian 
Operations, 50.1 million 
 related to 
the 
U.S. 
Operations 
and the 
remaining 
 1.6 
million for 
other 
and corporate. 
During 
the 
year 
ended 
 December 31, 2021, a net of 73.7 million of additional deposits were provided as collateral for bank guarantees 
 and our 
U.S. workers 
compensation obligations. 
Partially offsetting 
the cash 
used, was 
net proceeds 
of 27.5 
 million generated during the year ended December 31, 2021 
from the sale of Amonate.
 Financing activities
 Net cash 
used in 
financing 
activities was 
 784.3 million 
for the 
year ended 
December 
31, 2022, 
compared 
to 
 cash provided by financing activities of 
 80.8 million for the year ended December 
31, 2021. The net cash used 
 in financing activities for 
the year ended December 
31, 2022, included dividend 
payments of 700.2
 million, net 
 of a 
 1.4 million 
foreign exchange 
gain on 
settlement 
of dividends 
for shareholders 
who elected 
to be

As 
discussed 
in 
 Critical 
 Accounting 
Policies

Estimates Carrying 
Value 
of 
Asset 
Retirement 
Obligations 
below, 
the 
current 
and 
 non-current 
carrying 
amount 
of 
our 
ARO 
involves 
several 
estimates, 
including 
the 
amount 
and 
timing 
of 
the 
 payments required to satisfy 
these obligations. The timing 
of payments is based on numerous 
factors, including 
 projected 
mine 
closure 
dates. 
Based 
on 
our 
assumptions, 
the 
carrying 
amount 
of 
our 
ARO 
as 
determined 
in 
 accordance with U.S. GAAP was 138.5 million as of 
December 31, 2022.
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
 The preparation 
of 
our Consolidated 
Financial 
Statements 
in conformity 
with 
U.S. GAAP 
requires 
us 
to 
make 
 estimates 
and 
assumptions 
that 
affect 
the 
reported 
amounts 
of 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
at 
the 
date 
of 
the 
 Consolidated 
Financial 
Statements 
and 
the 
reported 
amounts 
of 
revenue 
and 
expenses 
during 
the 
reporting 
 period. 
Listed 
below 
are 
the 
accounting 
estimates 
that 
we 
believe 
are 
critical 
to 
our 
Consolidated 
Financial 
 Statements due to the degree of 
uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and 
the magnitude 
 of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported. All of these accounting 
estimates and assumptions, as 
 well 
as 
the 
resulting 
impact 
to 
our 
Consolidated 
Financial 
Statements, 
have 
been 
discussed 
with 
the 
Audit, 
 Governance and Risk Committee, or Audit Committee, 
of our Board of Directors.
 See Note 2. 
 Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies 
to the accompanying 
audited Consolidated Financial 
 Statements for a summary of our significant accounting 
policies. 
 Fair Value of Non-Financial Assets
 Our 
non-financial 
assets 
valuations 
are 
primarily 
comprised 
of 
our 
determination 
of 
the 
estimated 
fair 
value 
 allocation of net tangible 
and intangible assets, our 
annual assessment of 
the recoverability of 
our goodwill and 
 our evaluation of the recoverability of our other long-lived 
assets upon certain triggering events.
 Long-Lived Assets
 We review 
the carrying 
value of 
intangible 
assets with 
definite lives 
and 
other long-lived 
assets to 
be used 
in 
 operations annually 
or whenever 
events or 
changes in 
circumstances 
indicate that 
the carrying 
amount of 
the 
 assets or asset groups might not be recoverable. 

Table of Contents 
 Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 
31, 2022 
113 
 Factors that would necessitate 
an impairment assessment 
include a significant adverse 
change in the extent 
or 
 manner in which an asset is 
used, a significant adverse change in 
legal factors or the business climate 
that could 
 affect 
the 
value 
of 
the 
asset 
group 
or 
a significant 
decline 
in 
the 
observable 
market 
value 
of 
an 
asset 
group, 
 among others. If such facts 
indicate a potential impairment, 
the recoverability of the asset 
group is assessed by 
 determining whether the carrying value 
of the asset group exceeds 
the sum of the projected 
undiscounted cash 
 flows expected to 
result from 
the use and 
eventual disposition 
of the asset 
group over the 
remaining economic 
 life of the asset 
group. If the projected undiscounted cash 
flows are less than 
the carrying amount, an impairment 
 is recorded 
for the 
excess of 
the carrying 
amount over 
the estimated 
fair value, 
which is 
generally determined 
 using discounted future cash 
flows. Any such write 
down is included in 
impairment expense in our 
consolidated 
 statement of operations.
 A high degree of 
judgment is required 
to estimate the 
fair value of 
our intangible and 
long-lived assets, and 
the 
 conclusions that 
we reach 
could vary 
significantly based 
on these 
judgments. 
We make 
various 
assumptions, 
 including assumptions regarding 
future cash flows 
in our 
assessments of 
fair value. The 
assumptions about future 
 cash 
flows 
and 
growth 
rates 
are 
based 
on 
the 
current 
and 
long-term 
business 
plans 
related 
to 
the 
long-lived 
 assets. Discount 
rate assumptions 
are based 
on an 
assessment of 
the risk 
inherent in 
the future 
cash flows 
of 
 the long-lived assets.
 At 
December 
31, 
2022, 
we 
determined, 
based 
on 
our 
qualitative 
assessment, 
that 
no 
impairment 
indicators 
 existed. 
 Goodwill Impairment
 We had 
a balance 
of goodwill 
of 28.0 million 
recorded at 
December 31, 
2022, which 
was generated 
upon the 
 acquisition of Buchanan 
in 2016. We 
perform our annual assessment 
of the recoverability of 
our goodwill in 
the 
 fourth quarter of each year. We utilize a qualitative assessment for determining whether the quantitative goodwill 
 impairment analysis is 
necessary. 
The accounting guidance 
permits entities to 
first assess qualitative 
factors to 
 determine whether it is more 
likely than not that the 
fair value of a reporting 
unit is less than its carrying 
amount 
 as 
a 
basis 
for 
determining 
whether 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
perform 
the 
quantitative 
goodwill 
impairment 
test. 
In 
 evaluating goodwill on 
a qualitative basis, 
we review the 
business performance 
of the Buchanan 
mine complex 
 (the only reporting 
unit with 
a goodwill balance) 
and evaluate 
other relevant 
factors as 
identified in the 
relevant 
 accounting 
guidance 
to 
determine 
whether 
it 
is 
more 
likely 
than 
not 
that 
an 
indicator 
of 
impairment 
exists 
at 
 Buchanan. We consider whether there are any negative macroeconomic conditions, industry specific conditions, 
 market 
changes, 
increased 
competition, 
increased 
costs 
in 
doing 
business, 
management 
challenges, 
legal 
 environments and how these factors might 
impact company specific performance in future periods. 
As part of the 
 analysis, we 
also consider 
fair value 
determinations for 
certain reporting 
units that 
have been 
made at 
various 
 points throughout 
the current 
and prior 
year for 
other purposes 
to ensure 
there is 
no contrary 
evidence to 
our 
 analysis. At 
December 31, 
2022, we 
did not 
perform a 
quantitative impairment 
assessment as 
we determined, 
 based on our qualitative assessment, that no impairment 
indicators existed.
 Assets held for sale
 As of December 31, 2022, the assets 
and liabilities held for sale represent the fair value 
of the Greenbrier mining 
 asset, which may be realized through a potential sale within the 
next 12 months. 
 The fair value of the Greenbrier mining asset was primarily driven by indicative offers and Level 3 inputs such as 
 estimates 
of 
future 
cash 
flows 
which 
aligns 
to 
the 
Company s 
best 
estimate 
of 
future 
market 
and 
operating 
 conditions, including 
its current 
life of 
mine plan. 
The life 
of mine 
plan includes 
assumptions in 
relation to 
coal 
 price forecasts, projected mine production volumes, operating costs, 
capital costs and discount rate.
 Carrying Value of Asset Retirement 
Obligations
 The Company is required to maintain a liability 
(and associated asset) for the expected value of future 
retirement 
 obligations on their mines, in line with ASC 410, Asset 
Retirement and Environmental Obligations.
 Reclamation 
of 
areas 
disturbed 
by 
mining 
operations 
must 
be 
performed 
by 
us 
in 
accordance 
with 
approved 
 reclamation plans and in compliance with state and federal laws in the states of West Virginia and Virginia 
in the 
 U.S., and Queensland in Australia. For areas disturbed, a significant amount of the reclamation will take place in 
 the future, when 
operations cease. There 
were no assets 
that were 
legally restricted for 
purposes of settling 
asset 
 retirement obligations 
as of 
December 31, 
2022. In 
addition, state 
agencies monitor 
compliance with 
the mine 
 plans, including reclamation.

Table of Contents 
 Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December

114 
 We 
record 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
additions 
to 
our 
asset 
retirement 
obligations 
using 
the 
present 
value 
of 
projected 
 future 
cash 
flows 
discounted 
using 
a 
credit-adjusted 
risk-free 
rate, 
with 
an 
equivalent 
amount 
recorded 
as 
a 
 long-lived asset. An accretion 
cost is recorded each 
period and the capitalized cost 
is depreciated over the 
useful 
 life of the 
related asset. As reclamation 
work is performed or 
liabilities are otherwise settled, the 
recorded amount 
 of the liability is reduced.
 A review 
of restoration 
and 
decommissioning 
provisions 
is carried 
out annually 
on a 
mine-by-mine 
basis, 
and 
 adjustments are made to reflect any changes in estimates, if necessary. On an interim basis, we may update the 
 liability based on significant changes to the life of mine or significant increases in disturbances during the period.
 Expected Credit Losses
 For trade and related party 
receivables carried at amortized 
cost, we determine expected 
credit losses, or ECL, 
 on a forward-looking basis. The amount of ECL is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk 
 since the 
initial recognition of 
the respective 
financial instrument. We 
recognize the lifetime 
ECL. ECL is 
estimated 
 based on our 
historic credit loss 
experience, adjusted for 
factors that are 
specific to the 
financial asset, general 
 economic 
conditions, 
financial 
asset 
type, 
term 
and 
an 
assessment 
of 
both 
the 
current 
as 
well 
as 
forecast 
 conditions, including 
the expected 
timing of 
collection, at 
the reporting 
date, modified 
for credit 
enhancements 
 such 
as 
letters 
of 
credit 
obtained. 
To 
measure 
ECL, 
trade 
and 
related 
party 
receivables 
have 
been 
grouped 
 based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days 
past due.
 We consider 
an event 
of default 
has occurred 
when 
a financial 
asset is 
significantly 
past due 
or other 
factors 
 indicate that the debtor 
is unlikely to pay 
amounts owed to us. 
A financial asset is 
credit impaired when there 
is 
 evidence that the counterparty 
is in significant financial 
difficulty or a 
breach of contract, such 
as default or past 
 due event 
has occurred. 
We write 
off a 
financial asset 
when there 
is information 
indicating there 
is no 
realistic 
 prospect of recovery of the asset 
from the counterparty. 
The amount of the impairment 
loss is recognized in the 
 consolidated statement of operations 
and other comprehensive income 
within Decrease (increase) in provision 
 for discounting 
and 
credit 
losses . 
Subsequent 
recoveries 
of 
amounts 
previously 
written 
off 
are credit 
against 
 Decrease (increase) provision for discounting and 
credit losses in the 
consolidated statement of operations and 
 other comprehensive income.
 Recoverable Coal Reserves
 There are numerous uncertainties inherent 
in estimating quantities and values of 
economically recoverable coal 
 reserves, 
including 
many 
factors 
beyond 
our 
control. 
As 
a 
result, 
estimates 
of 
economically 
recoverable 
coal 
 reserves 
are 
by 
their 
nature 
uncertain. 
Information 
about 
our 
reserves 
consists 
of 
estimates 
based 
on 
 engineering, 
economic 
and 
geological 
data 
assembled 
and 
analyzed 
by 
our 
staff 
and 
third-party 
qualified 
 persons. Our 
reserves are 
periodically reviewed 
by an 
independent third 
party consultant. 
Some of 
the factors 
 and assumptions which impact economically recoverable reserve 
estimates include:
 
geological settings;
 
historical production from the area compared with production from 
other producing areas;
 
the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental 
agencies
 ;
 
assumptions governing future prices; and
 
future operating costs.
 Each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the 
assumptions used in estimating reserves. For these 
 reasons, 
estimates 
of 
the 
economically 
recoverable 
quantities 
of 
coal 
attributable 
to 
a 
particular 
group 
of 
 properties, and classifications 
of these reserves 
based on the 
risk of recovery 
and estimates of 
future net cash 
 flows, 
may 
vary 
substantially. 
Actual 
production, 
revenues 
and 
expenditures 
with 
respect 
to 
our 
reserves 
will 
 likely 
vary 
from 
estimates, 
and 
these 
variances 
may 
be 
material. 
See 
Item 1A. 
 Risk 
Factors We 
rely 
on 
 estimates of our 
recoverable reserves, 
which is complex 
due to geological 
characteristics of the 
properties and 
 the number of assumptions made 
and Item 2. Properties for discussions 
of the uncertainties in estimating 
our 
 proven and probable coal reserves.
 Taxes
 We are required to 
estimate the amount of 
tax payable or 
refundable for the 
current year and the 
deferred income 
 tax liabilities and assets 
for the future tax consequences 
of events that have 
been reflected in our 
Consolidated 

Table of Contents 
 Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December 
31, 2022 
115 
 Financial Statements 
or tax 
returns for 
each taxing 
jurisdiction in 
which we 
operate. This 
process requires 
our 
 management to 
make judgments 
regarding the 
timing and 
probability of 
the ultimate 
tax impact 
of the 
various 
 agreements 
and 
transactions 
that 
we 
enter 
into. 
Based 
on 
these 
judgments 
we 
may 
record 
tax 
reserves 
or 
 adjustments 
to 
valuation 
allowances 
on 
deferred 
tax 
assets 
to 
reflect 
the 
expected 
realizability 
of 
future 
tax 
 benefits. Actual income 
taxes could vary 
from these estimates 
due to 
future changes in 
income tax 
law, significant 
 changes 
in 
the 
jurisdictions 
in 
which 
we 
operate, 
our 
inability 
to 
generate 
sufficient 
future 
taxable 
income 
or 
 unpredicted results from the final 
determination of each year s 
liability by taxing authorities. These 
changes could 
 have a significant impact on our financial position.

 ITEM 7A. 
QUANTITATIVE 
AND QUALITATIVE 
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our activities 
expose us 
to 
a variety 
of financial 
risks, such 
as commodity 
price risk, 
interest rate 
risk, foreign 
 currency risk, liquidity risk and credit 
risk. The overall risk management objective is 
to minimize potential adverse 
 effects on our financial performance from those risks 
which are not coal price related. 
 We manage 
financial risk 
through policies 
and procedures 
approved by 
our Board 
of Directors. 
These specify 
 the responsibility 
of the 
Board 
of Directors 
and 
management 
with regard 
to the 
management 
of financial 
risk. 
 Financial risks are 
managed centrally by 
our finance 
team under the 
direction of the 
Group Chief 
Financial Officer. 
 The finance team manages risk exposures primarily through delegated authority limits approved by the Board of 
 Directors. The finance team regularly monitors our 
exposure to these financial risks and reports 
to management 
 and 
the 
Board 
of 
Directors 
on 
a 
regular 
basis. 
Policies 
are 
reviewed 
at 
least 
annually 
and 
amended 
where 
 appropriate. 
 We may use 
derivative financial instruments such 
as forward fixed 
price commodity contracts, interest 
rate swaps 
 and 
foreign 
exchange 
rate 
contracts 
to 
hedge 
certain 
risk 
exposures. 
Derivatives 
for 
speculative 
purposes 
is 
 strictly prohibited by the Treasury Risk Management Policy approved by our Board of 
Directors. We use different 
 methods 
to 
measure 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
we 
are 
exposed 
to 
various 
financial 
risks. 
These 
methods 
include 
 sensitivity analysis in 
the case of 
interest rate, foreign 
exchange and other 
price risks and 
aging analysis for 
credit 
 risk. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Coal Price Risk 
 We 
are 
exposed 
to 
domestic 
and 
global 
coal 
prices. 
Our 
principal 
philosophy 
is 
that 
our 
investors 
would 
not 
 consider 
hedging 
of 
coal 
prices 
to 
be 
in 
the 
long-term 
interest 
of 
our 
stockholders. 
Therefore, 
any 
potential 
 hedging of coal prices through long-term fixed price contracts is subject to the approval of our Board of Directors 
 and would only be adopted in exceptional circumstances. 
 The 
expectation 
of 
future 
prices 
for 
coal 
depends 
upon 
many 
factors 
beyond 
our 
control. 
Met 
coal 
has 
been 
 volatile commodity 
over the 
past ten 
years. Recently, 
in the 
second quarter 
of 2022, 
seaborne prices 
reached 
 record levels with both the Australian and U.S. Met coal price indices exceeding 600 per Mt, largely as result of 
 supply concerns 
in key 
Met coal 
markets and 
continued trade 
flow disruptions 
caused by 
geopolitical tensions 
 following Russian 
invasion 
of Ukraine. 
The demand 
and supply 
in the 
Met coal 
industry changes 
from time 
to 
 time. There are no assurances that oversupply will not occur, that demand will not decrease or that overcapacity 
 will not 
occur, 
which could 
cause declines 
in the 
prices of 
coal, which 
could have 
a material 
adverse effect 
on 
 our financial condition and results of operations 
 Additionally, 
access to 
international markets 
may be 
subject to 
ongoing interruptions 
and trade 
barriers due 
to 
 policies and tariffs of individual countries. For example, the imposition of restrictions 
by China on Australian coal 
 into the 
Country, 
may in 
the future 
have a 
negative impact 
on our 
profitability. 
We may 
or may 
not be 
able to 
 access alternate 
markets for 
our coal 
should additional 
interruptions and 
trade barriers 
occur in 
the future. 
An 
 inability 
for 
Met 
coal 
suppliers 
to 
access 
international 
markets, 
including 
China, 
would 
likely 
result 
in 
an 
 oversupply of Met coal and may result in a decrease in 
prices and or the curtailment of production. 
 We manage 
our commodity 
price risk 
for our non-trading, 
thermal coal 
sales through 
the use 
of long-term 
coal 
 supply agreements in our 
U.S. Operations. In Australia, thermal 
coal is sold 
to Stanwell on a 
supply contract. See 
 Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks related to the Supply Deed with Stanwell may 
adversely affect our financial 
 condition and results of operations. 
 Sales commitments in the 
Met coal market are typically 
not long-term in nature, 
and we are therefore subject 
to 
 fluctuations 
in 
market 
pricing. 
Certain 
coal 
sales 
in 
our 
Australian 
Operations 
are 
provisionally 
priced 
initially. 
 Provisionally priced sales 
are those for 
which price 
finalization, referenced 
to the relevant 
index, is outstanding 
 at the reporting date. The final sales price is 
determined within 7 to 90 days after delivery 
to the customer. 
As of 
 December 31, 2022, 
we had 13.7 
million of outstanding 
provisionally priced receivables 
subject to changes 
in 
 the relevant price index. If prices decreased 10 , these provisionally priced receivables would decrease by 1.4 
 million. 
See Part 
I, Item 
1A. 
 Risk 
Factors Our 
profitability depends 
upon the 
prices 
we receive 
for our 
coal. 
 Prices for coal are volatile and can fluctuate widely based upon 
a number of factors beyond our control.

 Diesel Fuel 
 We may 
be exposed 
to price 
risk in 
relation to 
other commodities 
from time 
to time 
arising from 
raw materials 
 used in our operations (such as gas or 
diesel). These commodities may be hedged through financial instruments 
 if the 
exposure is 
considered material 
and where 
the exposure 
cannot be 
mitigated through 
fixed price 
supply 
 agreements. 
 The fuel required for our operations in fiscal year 2023 will be purchased under fixed-price contracts or on 
a spot 
 basis. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk is the risk that a change in interest rates 
on our borrowing facilities will have an adverse impact 
 on financial performance, investment decisions 
and stockholder return. Our 
objectives in managing our exposure 
 to interest rates include 
minimizing interest costs 
in the long term, 
providing a reliable estimate 
of interest costs 
 for 
the 
annual 
work 
program 
and 
budget 
and 
ensuring 
that 
changes 
in 
interest 
rates 
will 
not 
have 
a 
material 
 impact on our financial performance. 
 As 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
we 
had 
 255.2 million 
of 
fixed-rate 
borrowings 
and 
Notes 
and 
there 
were 
 no variable-rate borrowings outstanding. 

 We currently do not hedge against interest rate 
fluctuations. 

 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 A significant portion of our 
sales are denominated in US . 
Foreign exchange risk is 
the risk that our earnings 
or 
 cash flows are adversely impacted by movements in exchange 
rates of currencies that are not in US . 
 Our main exposure 
is to the 
A -US exchange rate 
through our Australian 
Operations, which have 
predominantly 
 A 
denominated 
costs. 
In 
2022, 
greater 
than 
60 
of 
expenses 
incurred 
at 
our 
Australian 
Operations 
were 
 denominated in 
A . Approximately 
40 of 
our Australian 
Operations 
purchases were 
made with 
reference 
to 
 US , which provides 
a natural hedge 
against foreign exchange 
movements on these 
purchases (including fuel, 
 several port handling charges, 
demurrage, purchased coal 
and some insurance 
premiums). Appreciation of 
the 
 A against 
US will 
increase our 
Australian Operations 
US reported 
cost base 
and reduce 
US reported 
net 
 income. For 
the portion 
of US 
required to 
purchase A 
to settle 
our Australian 
Operations operating 
costs, a 
 10 
increase 
in 
the 
A 
to 
US 
exchange 
rate 
would 
have 
increased 
reported 
total 
costs 
and 
expenses 
by 
 approximately 99.0 million for the year ended December 
31, 2022. 

 Under normal market conditions, we generally do not consider it necessary to hedge our 
exposure to this foreign 
 exchange risk. 
However, 
there 
may be 
specific commercial 
circumstances, 
such 
as the 
hedging 
of significant 
 capital 
expenditure, 
acquisitions, 
disposals 
and 
other 
financial 
transactions, 
where 
we 
may 
deem 
foreign 
 exchange hedging 
as appropriate 
and 
where a 
US contract 
cannot 
be negotiated 
directly with 
suppliers 
and 
 other third parties. 

 For our Australian 
Operations, we 
translate all 
monetary assets 
and liabilities 
at the period-end 
exchange rate, 
 all non-monetary 
assets and 
liabilities at 
historical 
rates 
and revenue 
and expenses 
at the 
average exchange 
 rates in effect during 
the periods. The net 
effect of these 
translation adjustments is 
shown in the accompanying 
 Consolidated Financial Statements within components 
of net income. 
 We currently do not hedge our non-US exposures 
against exchange rate fluctuations. 
 Credit Risk 
 Credit risk is the risk of 
sustaining a financial loss 
as a result of a counterparty 
not meeting its obligations under 
 a financial instrument or customer contract. 
 We are exposed 
to credit risk 
when we have financial 
derivatives, cash deposits, 
lines of credit, letters 
of credit 
 or bank guarantees 
in place with 
financial institutions. To mitigate against credit risk 
from financial counterparties, 
 we have minimum credit rating requirements with financial 
institutions where we transact. 

Table of Contents 
 Coronado Global Resources Inc. Form 10-K December

118 
 We 
are 
also 
exposed 
to 
counterparty 
credit 
risk 
arising 
from 
our 
operating 
activities, 
primarily 
from 
trade 
 receivables. Customers who wish to trade on 
credit terms are subject to credit 
verification procedures, including 
 an assessment of their independent credit rating, financial position, past experience and industry reputation. 
We 
 monitor the financial performance 
of counterparties on a routine 
basis to ensure credit 
thresholds are achieved. 
 Where required, we will request additional credit 
support, such as letters of credit, 
to mitigate against credit risk. 
 Credit 
risk 
is 
monitored 
regularly, 
and 
performance 
reports 
are 
provided 
to 
our 
management 
and 
Board 
of 
 Directors. 
 As of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
we had 
financial 
assets 
of 
 838.8 
million, 
comprising 
of cash 
and 
restricted 
cash, 
 trade receivables and 
restricted deposits, 
which are exposed 
to counterparty 
credit risk. These 
financial assets 
 have been assessed under ASC 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses, and 
a provision for discounting and 
 credit 
losses 
of 
 5.1 
million 
was 
recorded 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2022.

is reviewed 
for impairment 
annually or 
when circumstances or 
other events 
indicate that 
impairment 
 may have occurred. The Company follows the guidance in Accounting Standards Update 2017-04 
 Intangibles 
 Goodwill 
and 
Other: 
Simplifying 
the 
Test 
for 
Goodwill 
Impairment
 
(ASU 2017-04). 
The 
Company 
makes 
a 
 qualitative assessment of whether it 
is more likely than 
not that a 
reporting unit s fair value is 
less than its carrying 
 amount. Circumstances that are considered as 
part of the qualitative 
assessment and could trigger a 
quantitative 
 impairment test include but are 
not limited to: a significant 
adverse change in the business 
climate; a significant 
 adverse legal judgment; 
adverse cash flow 
trends; an 
adverse action 
or assessment 
by a government 
agency; 
 unanticipated 
competition; 
and 
a 
significant 
restructuring 
charge 
within 
a 
reporting 
unit. 
If 
a 
quantitative 
 assessment 
is 
determined 
to 
be 
necessary, 
the 
Company 
compares 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
a 
reporting 
unit 
with 
its 
 carrying amount, including goodwill. 
If the carrying amount 
of a reporting unit 
exceeds its fair value, 
the Company 
 recognizes an impairment 
charge for the 
amount by which 
the carrying amount 
exceeds its fair 
value to the 
extent 
 of the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 
 The Company defines reporting 
units at the mining 
asset level. For purposes 
of testing goodwill for 
impairment, 
 goodwill has been allocated to the reporting units to the 
extent it relates to each reporting unit.

The 
 organization of the

CODM, 
 manages and allocates resources to the various components 
of the Company s business. 

 The CODM 
uses Adjusted 
EBITDA as 
the primary 
metric to

 Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
Investors should be 
 aware that 
the Company s 
presentation of 
Adjusted EBITDA 
may not 
be comparable 
to similarly 
titled financial 
 measures used by other companies. 

 Adjusted EBITDA is 
defined as earnings 
before interest, taxes, 
depreciation, depletion and 
amortization and other 
 foreign exchange losses. Adjusted EBITDA is 
also adjusted for certain discrete items that 
management exclude 
 in analyzing each 
of the 
Company s segments operating performance. 
 Other and corporate 
relates to additional 
 financial information for the corporate function such 
as financial reporting and accounting, treasury, legal, human 
 resources, compliance, 
and tax. 
As such, the 
corporate function 
is not determined 
to be 
a reportable segment 
 but is discretely disclosed for purposes of reconciliation to the

 The dividend 
policy 
and 
the

are subject 
to 
the 
discretion 
of the 
Company s 
 Board of Directors. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company declared: 
 
Dividends of 

million, or

 (c) 
Earnings per Share 
 Basic earnings per 
share of common 
stock is computed 
by dividing net 
income attributable 
to the Company 
for 
 the period, 
by the 
weighted-average 
number of 
shares 
of common 
stock outstanding 
during the 
same period. 
 Diluted earnings per share of common stock is computed 
by dividing net income attributable to the Company 
by 
 the weighted-average number 
of shares 
of common 
stock outstanding adjusted 
to give 
effect to potentially 
dilutive 
 securities. During periods in which the Company incurs 
a net loss, diluted weighted average shares outstanding 
 are equal to basic weighted average shares outstanding 
because the effect of all equity awards is anti-dilutive. 
 Basic and diluted earnings per share was calculated as 
follows (in thousands, except per share data):

The Inflation Reduction 
Act includes a

Build Back Better legislation that would 
impose a 
 
 minimum 
 tax on adjusted

As of December 31, 
2022, the Company recorded 
a valuation allowance against 
a deferred tax asset 
of an equal amount 
which relates 
 predominantly to foreign tax credits, tax losses, land and 
goodwill in Australia which is in the Other category in 
the table. Due to the capital 
 character of these items and the 
lack of expected capital gains, 
the Australian group is not expected 
to realize the benefit of this 
deferred tax 
 asset. 
 Unrecognized Tax 
Benefits 
 The 
Company 
provides 
for 
uncertain 
tax 
positions, 
and 
the 
related 
interest 
and 
penalties, 
based 
upon 
 management s assessment of whether a tax benefit is 
more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by 
 tax authorities. 
To 
the extent 
that the 
anticipated 
tax outcome 
of these 
uncertain 
tax positions 
changes, 
such 
 changes in estimate will impact the income tax 
provision in the period in which such determination is made. 
The 
 Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax 
positions as a component of income 
 tax expense. 
 The Company 
did not 
identify any 
new uncertain 
tax positions 
during the 
year ended 
December 31, 
2021 and 
 2022, and as 
a result the 
Company does 
 
 t have any 
recorded uncertain tax positions 
as of December 
31, 2022. 
 The Company 
recorded 

amounts related 
to interest 
and penalties 
on uncertain 
tax positions 
for 2022, 2021 
 and 2020 and these years remain open to examination 
by U.S. and Australian tax authorities.

million and 

million as of December 31, 
2022 and 2021, respectively, to provide back-to-back support 
 for bank guarantees, financial 
payments, other performance obligations, various 
other operating agreements and 
 contractual obligations 
under workers 
compensation insurance. 
These deposits 
are restricted 
and classified 
as 
 long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 In accordance 
with the 
terms of 
the ABL 
Facility, 
the Company 
may be 
required 
to cash 
collateralize 
the ABL 
 Facility to the extent of outstanding letters of credit after the expiration or termination date of such letter of credit. 
 As of December 31, 2022, 

such letter of credit was outstanding and as such 

cash collateral was required. 
 For the U.S. Operations in order to provide the required financial assurance, the Company generally uses surety 
 bonds for post-mining reclamation. The Company can also use bank letters of credit to collateralize certain other 
 obligations. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding surety bonds of 

million and letters of 
 credit of 

million issued from our available bank guarantees, 
to meet contractual obligations under workers 
 compensation insurance and to secure various 
obligations and commitments. Future regulatory changes relating 
 to these obligations could result in increased obligations, 
additional costs or additional collateral requirements. 
 For the Australian Operations, the Company had bank guarantees outstanding 
of 
 
 million at December 31, 
 2022, primarily in respect of certain rail and port arrangements 
of the Company. 

 At December 31, 2022, the Company had total outstanding 
bank guarantees provided of 

million to secure 
 obligations and commitments. 
 Stamp duty on Curragh acquisition 
 On September 27, 2022, the Company received from 
the Queensland Revenue Office, or QRO, 
an assessment 
 of the stamp duty 
payable on its 
acquisition of the Curragh 
mine in March 
2018. The QRO assessed 
the stamp 
 duty 
on 
this 
acquisition 
at 
an 
amount 
of 

million 
(A 

million) 
plus 
unpaid 
tax 
interest 
of 

million 
 (A 

million). 
On 
November 
23, 
2022, 
the 
Company 
filed 
an 
objection 
to 
the 
assessment 
and 
is 
currently 
 awaiting the outcome of this objection. The outcome of 
this objection is uncertain. 

 The Company 
has reviewed 
the assessment 
received and 
based on 
legal and 
valuation advice 
it has 
sought, 
 continues to maintain its position and the estimated accrual of 

million (A 

million) stamp duty payable 
 on the Curragh acquisition. During 
the period the Company made a partial 
payment of stamp duty, 
reducing the 
 remaining estimated accrual 
for stamp duty 
to 

million (A 

million) as at December 
31, 2022, which 
is 
 included within Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities 
in its Consolidated Balance sheet. 

 From time to time, the 
Company becomes a 
party to other legal 
proceedings in the 
ordinary course of business 
 in Australia, the U.S. and other countries where the Company does business. 
Based on current information, the 
 Company believes that such other pending 
or threatened proceedings are likely to 
be resolved without a material 
 adverse 
effect 
on 
its 
financial 
condition, 
results 
of 
operations 
or 
cash 
flows. 
In 
management s 
opinion, 
the 
 Company is not currently 
involved in any legal 
proceedings, which individually 
or in the aggregate 
could have a 
 material effect on the financial condition, results of 
operations and/or liquidity of the Company.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC 
ACCOUNTING FIRM
 To 
the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Coronado 
Global Resources Inc. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We 
have 
audited 
the 
accompanying 
consolidated 
balance 
sheets 
of 
Coronado 
Global 
Resources 
Inc. 
(the 
 Company) 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2022 
and 
2021, 
the 
related 
consolidated 
statements 
of 
operations 
and 
 comprehensive 
income, 
stockholders 
equity 
and 
cash 
flows 
for 
each 
of 
the 
three 
years 
in 
the 
period 
ended 
 December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In 
 our opinion, the consolidated financial 
statements present fairly, 
in all material respects, the 
financial position of 
 the Company at December 31, 2022 and 
2021, and the results of its 
operations and its cash flows for 
each of the 
 three 
years 
in 
the 
period 
ended 
December 
31, 
2022, 
in 
conformity 
with 
U.S. 
generally 
accepted 
accounting 
 principles. 
 We 
also 
have 
audited, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
standards 
of the 
Public 
Company 
Accounting 
Oversight 
Board 
 (United States) 
(PCAOB), the 
Company's internal control 
over financial 
reporting as 
of December 
31, 2022, 
based 
 on 
criteria 
established 
in 
Internal 
Control-Integrated 
Framework 
issued 
by 
the 
Committee 
of 
Sponsoring 
 Organizations of 
the Treadway Commission (2013 
framework) and our 
report dated 
February 21, 
2023 expressed 
 an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the 
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express 
 an opinion 
on the 
Company s financial statements 
based on 
our audits. 
We are a 
public accounting 
firm registered 
 with the PCAOB 
and are 
required to 
be independent 
with respect to 
the Company 
in accordance with 
the U.S. 
 federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission and 
 the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan 
 and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements are free of 
material 
 misstatement, whether 
due to 
error or 
fraud. Our 
audits included 
performing procedures 
to assess 
the risks 
of 
 material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that 
 respond to 
those risks. 
Such procedures 
included examining, 
on a 
test basis, 
evidence regarding 
the amounts 
 and disclosures 
in the 
financial statements. 
Our audits 
also included 
evaluating the 
accounting principles 
used 
 and significant 
estimates made 
by management, 
as well 
as evaluating 
the overall 
presentation of 
the financial 
 statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable 
basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical 
audit 
matter communicated 
below is 
a matter 
arising 
from 
the current 
period audit 
of the 
financial 
 statements that was communicated 
or required to be communicated 
to the audit committee and that: 
(1) relates 
 to accounts 
or disclosures that 
are material 
to the 
financial statements and 
(2) involved our 
especially challenging, 
 subjective, or 
complex judgments. 
The communication 
of the critical 
audit matter 
does not alter 
in any way 
our 
 opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements, taken as a whole, 
and we are not, by 
communicating the critical 
 audit matter below, 
providing a separate opinion on 
the critical audit matter or 
on the accounts or disclosures 
to 
 which it relates.

 Stamp Duty assessment on the acquisition of the 
Curragh mine
 Description of the 
 matter
 As described in Note 28 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company received an 
 assessment from 
the Queensland 
Revenue Office QRO for 
the stamp 
duty payable 
on 
 the Company s 
2018 acquisition 
of the 
Curragh mine. 
The QRO 
assessed the 
stamp duty 
 on this acquisition at an amount 
of 55.4 million plus unpaid tax interest 
of 8.2 million. 
The 
 Company disputes the QRO s calculation 
of the liability, which the Company estimates to 
be 
 29.0 million 
including unpaid 
tax interest. 
On November 
23, 2022, 
the Company 
filed an 
 objection to the assessment and is currently awaiting its 
outcome. 

 Auditing the accrual for the stamp duty obligation involved complex auditor judgment, 
given 
 the 
materiality 
of 
the 
assessment 
made 
by 
the 
QRO, 
the 
unique 
nature 
of 
the 
property 
 acquired 
and 
the 
resulting 
difficulty 
in 
assessing 
the 
Company s 
judgments 
around 
the 
 interpretation and application of the law to this matter. 
 How we 
 addressed the 
 matter in our 
 audit
 We 
obtained 
an 
understanding, 
evaluated 
the 
design 
and 
tested 
the 
operation 
of 
 management s controls related to the Company s process for the recognition, measurement 
 and 
disclosure 
of 
the 
stamp 
duty 
contingency, 
as 
a 
non-routine 
judgmental 
accounting 
 matter including the Company s interpretation of tax 
law. 

 Our 
audit 
procedures 
included, 
among 
others, 
understanding 
external 
legal 
counsel 
 opinions obtained by 
management to support 
their interpretation and 
application of the 
law 
 in this matter. We also 
discussed external legal counsel s 
opinion with external 
legal counsel 
 directly. 
 We 
involved 
our 
indirect 
tax 
professionals 
to 
help 
us 
evaluate 
the 
Company s 
judgments 
 around the interpretation and application 
of the law to this matter and 
the relative likelihood 
 of the multiple alternative potential outcomes. These potential outcomes included the risk of 
 litigation and estimations of interest and penalties payable. 
 We also evaluated the disclosures made in the 
consolidated financial statements.

 We have served as the Company s auditor 
since 2020.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We are 
subject to 
the periodic 
reporting requirements 
of the 
Exchange Act. 
We have 
designed our 
disclosure 
 controls and procedures 
to provide reasonable 
assurance that information we 
disclose in reports 
we file or 
submit 
 under the Exchange 
Act is recorded, 
processed, summarized, 
and reported within 
the time periods 
specified in 
 the 
rules 
and 
forms 
of 
the 
SEC. 
Disclosure 
controls 
and 
procedures 
are 
controls 
and 
procedures 
that 
are 
 designed

ensure 
that

reports 
filed 
under 
the 
Exchange 
Act 
is 
 recorded, processed, summarized 
and reported, within the 
time periods specified 
in the SEC s rules 
and forms. 
 Disclosure controls and procedures 
include, without limitation, 
controls and procedures 
designed to ensure that 
 information required 
to be 
disclosed by 
our company 
in the 
reports that 
it files 
or submits 
under the 
Exchange 
 Act is 
accumulated and communicated 
to our 
management, including its 
principal executive and 
principal financial 
 officers, 
or 
persons 
performing 
similar 
functions, 
as 
appropriate 
to 
allow 
timely 
decisions 
regarding 
required 
 disclosure. 

 The Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive 
 Officer 
and 
the 
Group 
Chief 
Financial 
Officer, 
evaluated 
the 
effectiveness 
of

controls and 
procedures (as 
defined in 
Rules 13a-15(e) 
under the 
Exchange Act) 
as of 
 the end of 
the period covered 
by this report, 
and concluded 
that such disclosure 
controls and 
procedures were 
 effective to provide reasonable assurance that the 
desired control objectives were achieved. 

 Changes to Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been 
no changes in 
our internal control 
over financial reporting 
or in 
other factors that 
occurred during 
 our 
last 
fiscal 
quarter 
that 
have 
materially 
affected, 
or 
are 
reasonably 
likely 
to 
materially 
affect, 
our 
internal 
 controls over financial reporting. 

 Management s Report on Internal Control 
Over Financial Reporting 
 Our management 
is responsible 
for establishing and 
maintaining adequate internal 
control over 
financial reporting 
 as 
defined 
in 
Rules 
13a-15(f) 
under 
the 
Exchange 
Act. 
Internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
is 
a 
process 
 designed to 
provide reasonable 
assurance regarding 
the reliability 
of financial 
reporting and 
the preparation 
of 
 the Company s 
consolidated financial 
statements for 
external purposes 
in accordance 
with generally 
accepted 
 accounting principles. 

 Internal control over financial reporting includes 
those policies and procedures that (i) pertain 
to the maintenance 
 of records that, 
in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions 
and dispositions of 
the assets

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC 
ACCOUNTING FIRM
 To 
the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Coronado 
Global Resources Inc. 

 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
 We have audited Coronado Global Resources 
Inc. s internal control over financial 
reporting as of December 31, 
 2022, 
based 
on 
criteria 
established 
in 
Internal 
Control Integrated 
Framework 
issued 
by 
the 
Committee 
of 
 Sponsoring Organizations 
of the 
Treadway 
Commission (2013 
framework) (the 
COSO criteria). 
In our 
opinion, 
 Coronado Global 
Resources 
Inc. (the 
Company) 
maintained, 
in 
all material 
respects, 
effective 
internal control 
 over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the 
COSO criteria. 
 We 
also 
have 
audited, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
standards 
of the 
Public 
Company 
Accounting 
Oversight 
Board 
 (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, 
 the 
related 
consolidated 
statements 
of 
operations 
and 
comprehensive 
income, 
stockholders 
equity 
and 
cash 
 flows for each 
of the three 
years in the 
period ended 
December 31, 2022, 
and the related 
notes and our 
report 
 dated February 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion 
thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and 
 for its assessment 
of the effectiveness 
of internal control 
over financial reporting 
included in the 
accompanying 
 Management s Report 
on Internal 
Control Over 
Financial Reporting. 
Our responsibility 
is to express 
an opinion 
 on the 
Company s internal 
control over 
financial reporting 
based on 
our audit. 
We are 
a public 
accounting firm 
 registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect 
to the Company in accordance with 
 the 
U.S. 
federal 
securities 
laws 
and 
the 
applicable 
rules 
and 
regulations 
of 
the 
Securities 
and 
Exchange 
 Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit 
in accordance with the standards 
of the PCAOB. Those standards 
require that we plan 
 and 
perform 
the 
audit 
to 
obtain 
reasonable 
assurance 
about 
whether 
effective 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
 reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding 
of internal control over financial reporting, 
assessing the risk that 
 a 
material 
weakness 
exists, 
testing 
and 
evaluating 
the 
design 
and 
operating 
effectiveness 
of 
internal 
control 
 based 
on 
the 
assessed 
risk, 
and 
performing 
such 
other 
procedures 
as 
we 
considered 
necessary 
in 
the 
 circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable 
basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over 
Financial Reporting
 A 
company s 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
is 
a 
process 
designed 
to 
provide 
reasonable 
assurance 
 regarding the reliability of financial reporting 
and the preparation of financial statements 
for external purposes in 
 accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. 
A company s internal 
control over financial 
reporting 
 includes those policies 
and procedures that (1) 
pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in 
reasonable detail, 
 accurately and 
fairly reflect 
the transactions and 
dispositions of the 
assets of 
the company; 
(2) provide reasonable 
 assurance 
that 
transactions 
are 
recorded 
as 
necessary 
to 
permit 
preparation 
of 
financial 
statements 
in 
 accordance with 
generally accepted 
accounting principles, 
and that 
receipts and 
expenditures of 
the company 
 are being 
made only 
in accordance 
with authorizations 
of management 
and directors 
of the 
company; and 
(3) 
 provide 
reasonable 
assurance 
regarding 
prevention 
or 
timely 
detection 
of 
unauthorized 
acquisition, 
use, 
or 
 disposition of the company s assets that could have 
a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because 
of 
its 
inherent 
limitations, 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting 
may 
not 
prevent 
or 
detect 
 misstatements. Also, 
projections of 
any evaluation 
of effectiveness 
to future 
periods are 
subject to 
the risk 
that 
 controls may 
become inadequate 
because of 
changes in 
conditions, or 
that the 
degree of 
compliance with 
the 
 policies or procedures may deteriorate.

in the 
United States 
is subject 
to regulation 
by the 
 Mine Safety and Health Administration, or 
MSHA, under the Federal Mine 
Safety and Health Act of 1977, or 
the 
 Mine Act. MSHA 
inspects these mines on 
a regular basis 
and issues various 
citations and orders when 
it believes 
 a violation has occurred 
under the Mine Act. 
We present information 
below regarding certain 
mining safety and 
 health 
citations 
that 
MSHA 
has 
issued 
with 
respect 
to 
our 
mining 
operations. 
In 
evaluating 
this 
information, 
 consideration should 
be given 
to factors 
such as: 
(i) the 
number of 
citations and 
orders will 
vary depending 
on 
 the size of the 
mine; (ii) the number of 
citations issued will vary from inspector 
to inspector and mine to 
mine; and 
 (iii) citations and 
orders can be 
contested and 
appealed and, in 
that process, are 
often reduced 
in severity and 
 amount, and are sometimes dismissed. Since MSHA is a branch of the U.S. Department of Labor, its jurisdiction 
 only applies to our operations in the 
United States. 
As such, the mine safety disclosures 
included herein do not 
 contain information related to our Australian mines. 
 Under the Dodd-Frank Act, each 
operator of a coal 
or other mine is 
required to include certain mine 
safety results 
 within its 
periodic reports 
filed with 
the Securities 
and Exchange 
Commission, or 
the SEC. 
As required 
by the 
 reporting 
requirements 
included 
in 
 1503(a) 
of 
the 
Dodd-Frank 
Act and 
Item 
104 
of 
Regulation 
S-K 
(17 
CFR 
 229.104), we present the following 
items regarding certain mining safety 
and health matters, for the 
year ended 
 December 31, 2022, for each 
of our U.S. mine 
locations that are covered 
under the scope of the 
Dodd-Frank Act. 
 The table that 
follows reflects 
citations and orders 
issued to 
us by MSHA 
during the year 
ended December 
31, 
 2022. 
The 
table 
only 
includes 
those 
U.S. 
mines 
that 
were 
issued 
orders 
or 
citations 
during 
this 
period, 
and 
 commensurate 
with 
SEC 
regulations, 
does 
not 
reflect 
orders 
or 
citations 
issued 
to 
independent 
contractors 
 working at our mines. 
The proposed assessments 
for the year ended 
December 31, 2022, were

Tazewell 
Counties, 
 Virginia 
(the 
 Property). 
An 
updated 
TRS 
was 
prepared 
in 
February 
2023 
due 
to 
material 
 differences 
in the key 
financial modifying factors 
including coal 
sales price assumptions, 
operating 
 costs 
and 
capital 
costs 
from 
December 
31,

 The 
Buchanan 
No. 
1 
Mine 
Complex 
is 
located 
in 
Buchanan 
County 
in 
southwest 
Virginia. 
The 
 Property 
is 
24 
kilometers 
northwest 
of 
the 
town 
of 
Richlands, 
Virginia 
and 
65.9 
kilometers 
 southeast 
of 
Pikeville, 
Kentucky. 
The 
nearest 
major 
population 
centers 
are 
Lexington, 
Kentucky 
 (290 kilometers northwest) 
and Roanoke, Virginia 
(153 kilometers northeast) (see 
 Figure 1-1). 
The 
 Property 
is 
composed 
of 
approximately 
33,577 
total 
hectares, 
of 
which 
25,852 
are 
leased

 Ownership 
 The 
Property 
was 
formerly 
controlled 
by 
 Consolidation 
Coal 
Company CONSOL)
 . 
Mine 
 development 
was 
started 
by CONSOL 
in 1983 
and longwall 
production began 
in 1987. 
Coronado 
 acquired the Buchanan Mine from CONSOL in March 2016. 
 1.3
 Geology 
 Operations 
at 
the 
Buchanan 
Mine 
Complex 
extract 
the 
Pocahontas 
No. 
3 
coal 
bed 
by 
longwall 
 mining 
methods. 
Strata 
of 
economic 
interest 
for 
this 
TRS 
are 
of 
the 
Pennsylvanian-age 
 Pocahontas 
Formation 
and 
the 
subject 
Pocahontas 
No. 
3 
seam 
is the 
principal 
coal 
seam of 
that 
 formation. 
Due to 
the high value 
of this 
low-volatile 
coking coal, 
it has been 
extensively mined 
in 
 the 
region. 
The 
seam 
is 
situated 
below 
drainage 
throughout 
the 
Property 
and 
is 
accessed 
by 
 existing mine shafts. 
 1.4
 Exploration Status 
 The 
Property 
has been 
extensively 
explored, 
largely 
by 
drilling 
using 
continuous 
coring 
methods, 
 rotary 
drilling 
but 
also 
by 
obtaining 
coal 
measurements 
at 
mine 
exposures, 
ongoing 
drilling 
 associated with 
degas activities, 
and by 
downhole geophysical 
methods. 
The majority 
of the data 
 was 
acquired 
or 
generated 
by 
previous 
owners 
of 
the 
Property. 
These 
sources 
comprise 
the 
 primary 
data 
used 
in 
the 
evaluation 
of 
the 
coal 
resources 
and 
coal 
reserves 
on 
the 
Property.

 MM A examined 
the data 
available for 
the evaluation 
and incorporated 
all pertinent 
information 
 into 
this 
TRS. 
Where 
data 
appeared 
to 
be 
anomalous 
or 
not 
representative, 
that 
data 
was 
 excluded from the digital databases and subsequent 
processing by MM A. 

 Ongoing 
exploration 
has been 
carried 
out 
by 
Coronado 
since 
acquiring the 
Buchanan 
Mine. 
The 
 exploration data acquired by 
Coronado has been consistent with past drilling activities. 
 1.5
 Operations and Development 
 Due 
to 
its 
coal 
reserve 
and 
seam 
characteristics, 
the 
Buchanan 
No. 
1 
Mine 
operates 
using 
the 
 longwall 
method. 
The 
model 
was 
therefore 
generated 
with 
longwall-mining 
constraints 
in 
mind 
 for 
Buchanan s 
underground 
resources. 
The 
mine 
produces 
coal 
that 
is 
suitable 
for 
the 
low-
 volatile metallurgical coal markets. 
 The Buchanan 
No. 1 
Mine in 
Buchanan County, 
Virginia, is 
the only 
active longwall 
mine currently 
 being operated by Coronado. 
 Coronado currently 
operates a 
coal preparation 
plant at 
Buchanan. 
The Buchanan Plant 
operates 
 at 
a 
feed 
rate 
of 
approximately 
1,270 
raw 
tonnes 
per 
hour tph)
 . 
Processes 
are 
typical 
of 
those 
 used in the coal industry and are in use at adjacent coal processing plants.

 Mineral 
resources, 
representing 
in-situ 
coal 
from 
a

A 
coal 
resource 
estimate, 
summarized 
in 
 Table

 , 
was 
prepared 
as 
of 
 December 31, 2022, for property controlled by Coronado.

 Mineral Reserve 
 Reserve tonnage 
estimates provided 
herein report 
coal reserves 
derived from 
the in-situ resource 
 tons 
presented 
in 
 Table 
1-1
 , 
and 
not 
in 
addition 
to 
coal 
resources. 
Proven 
and 
probable 
coal 
 reserves 
were 
derived 
from 
the 
defined 
coal 
resource 
considering 
relevant 
mining, 
processing, 
 infrastructure, 
economic 
(including 
estimates 
of 
capital, 
revenue, 
and 
cost), 
marketing, 
legal, 
 environmental, 
socio-economic 
and regulatory 
factors. 
The 
Resource 
estimate 
has been 
used 
as 
 the 
basis 
for 
this 
Reserve 
calculation, 
which 
utilizes 
a 
reasonable 
preliminary 
feasibility 
study, 
a 
 life-of-mine LOM) mine plan 
and practical 
recovery factors. 
Production modeling 
was completed 
 with an 
effective 
start date 
of October 
1, 2022. 
Additions and 
depletion have 
been used 
to bring 
 the Reserve estimate forward 
to December 31, 2022.

 4 
 Factors 
that 
would 
typically 
preclude 
conversion 
of 
a 
coal 
resource 
to 
coal 
reserve, 
include 
the 
 following: 
inferred 
resource 
classification; 
absence 
of 
coal 
quality; 
poor 
mine 
recovery; 
lack 
of 
 access; geological 
encumbrances 
associated 
with 
overlying 
and underlying 
strata; 
seam thinning; 
 structural 
complication; 
and 
insufficient 
exploration 
have 
all 
been 
considered. 
Reserve 
 consideration 
excludes 
those 
portions 
of 
the 
resource 
area 
which 
exhibit 
the 
aforementioned-
 geological and operational encumbrances. 

 Coal reserves are 
presented on 
a run-of-mine ROM) basis in 
 Table 
1-2
 . 
Proven and 
probable coal 
 reserves 
were 
derived 
from 
the 
defined 
in-situ 
coal 
resource 
considering 
relevant 
processing, 
 economic 
(including 
technical 
estimates 
of 
capital, 
revenue, 
and 
cost), 
marketing, 
legal, 
 environmental,

factors. 
The proven 
and probable 
coal reserves 
on 
 the Property are summarized below in

Note: Marketable reserve tonnes are reported on a moist basis, including a combination of surface and inherent moisture. 
The combination of 
 surface and inherent moisture is modeled at 6-percent. 
Actual product moisture is dependent upon multiple geological factors, operational 
 factors, 
and product contract specifications and can exceed 8-percent. 
As such, the modeled moisture values provide a level of conservatism 
 for reserve reporting. 
 In 
summary, 
Coronado 
controls 
a 
total 
of 
92.9 
Mt 
(moist 
basis) 
of 
marketable 
coal 
reserves, 
at 
 Buchanan, 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2022. 
Of 
that 
total, 
94 
percent 
are 
proven, 
and 
6 
percent 
are 
 probable. 
There are 
14.4 Mt 
of owned 
coal reserves 
and 75.9 
Mt of 
leased coal 
reserves and 
2.6 
 Mt of 
subleased reserves. 
All the Buchanan 
reserves are 
considered suitable 
for the 
metallurgical 
 coal market, and all of the Buchanan reserves are assigned.

 Coronado 
provided 
MM A 
with 
an 
inventory 
of 
operating 
equipment 
available 
at 
Buchanan. 

 MM A s 
capital 
schedules assume 
that 
major 
equipment 
rebuilds 
occur over 
the 
course 
of 
each 
 machine s 
remaining 
assumed 
operating 
life. 
Replacement 
equipment 
was 
scheduled 
based 
on 
 MM A s 
experience and 
knowledge of 
mining equipment 
and industry 
standards 
with respect 
to 
 the useful life of such equipment. 
A summary of the estimated capital for the 
Property is provided 
 in

 Operating Costs 
 Coronado 
provided 
historical 
and 
preliminary 
5-year 
projections 
of operating 
costs 
for 
Buchanan 
 for 
MM A s 
review. 
MM A 
used 
the 
historical 
and/or 
budget 
cost 
information 
as 
a 
reference 
 and 
developed 
personnel 
schedules 
for 
the 
mine 
and 
support 
facilities. 
Hourly 
labor 
rates 
and 
 salaries 
were 
based 
upon 
information 
contained 
in 
Coronado s 
financial 
summaries. 
Fringe-
 benefit 
costs 
were 
developed 
for 
vacation 
and 
holidays, 
federal 
and 
state 
unemployment 
 insurance, 
retirement, 
workers 
compensation 
and 
pneumoconiosis, 
casualty 
and 
life 
insurance, 
 healthcare, and bonuses. 
A cost factor 
for mine supplies 
was developed that 
relates expenditures 
 to 
mine advance 
rates 
for 
roof-control 
costs 
and other 
mine-supply costs 
at 
underground 
mines. 

 Other 
factors 
were 
developed 
for 
maintenance 
and 
repair 
costs, 
rentals, 
mine 
power, 
outside 
 services and other direct mining costs. 

 Operating 
costs 
factors 
were 
also 
developed 
for 
the 
coal 
preparation 
plant 
processing, 
refuse 
 handling, coal loading, property taxes, 
and insurance and bonding. 
Appropriate royalty 
rates were 
 assigned 
for 
production 
from 
leased 
coal 
lands, 
and 
sales 
taxes 
were 
calculated 
for 
state 
 severance taxes, 
the federal black lung excise tax, 
and federal and state reclamation 
fees. 
 A summary of the projected operating costs for the Property 
is provided in

 Economic Evaluation 
 The 
pre-feasibility 
financial 
model 
prepared 
for 
this 
TRS 
was 
developed 
to 
test 
the 
economic 
 viability 
of 
the 
coal 
resource 
area. 
The 
results 
of 
this 
financial 
model 
are 
not 
intended 
to 
 represent 
a 
bankable 
feasibility 
study, 
required 
for 
financing 
of 
any 
current 
or 
future 
mining 
 operations contemplated 
for the Coronado properties, 
but are intended to 
establish the economic 
 viability 
of 
the 
estimated 
coal 
reserves. 
Cash 
flows 
are 
simulated 
on an 
annual basis 
in 
nominal 
 dollars 
assuming 
a 
2 
inflation 
rate 
based 
on 
projected 
production 
from 
the 
coal 
reserves. 
The 
 discounted cash flow analysis presented herein 
is based on an effective date of January 1, 2023. 

 On an un-levered basis, the net 
present value NPV) of the project cash flow 
after taxes represents 
 the Enterprise 
Value of 
the project. 
The project cash 
flow, 
excluding debt 
service, is calculated 
by 
 subtracting direct 
and indirect 
operating expenses 
and capital 
expenditures from 
revenue. 
Direct 
 costs 
include 
labor, 
operating 
supplies, 
maintenance 
and 
repairs, 
facilities 
costs 
for 
materials 
 handling, 
coal 
preparation, 
refuse 
disposal, 
coal 
loading, 
reclamation 
and 
general 
and 
 administrative costs. 
Indirect costs include statutory and legally agreed 
upon fees related to direct 
 extraction 
of 
the 
mineral. 
The 
indirect 
costs 
are 
the 
federal 
black 
lung 
tax, 
federal 
and 
state 
 reclamation taxes, property 
taxes, coal production royalties, 
and income taxes.

are 
driven 
by 
annual

which 
at 
steady-state 
level 
ranges 
 from 
a 
peak 
of 
6.5 
million 
tonnes 
in 
2034 
to 
a 
low 
of 
0.7 
million

Projected 
 consolidated 
revenue 
ranges 
from 
 317.8 
million 
to 
 1.019 
billion 
at 
a 
steady 
state. 
Revenue 
 totals 14.2 billion for the project s 
life. 
 Consolidated 
cash 
flow 
from 
operations 
is 
positive 
throughout 
the 
projected 
operating 
period, 
 with 
the 
exception 
of 
post-production

due 
to 
end-of-mine

 Discounted Cash Flow Analysis 
 Cash flow after 
tax, but before 
debt service, generated 
over the life 
of the project 
was discounted 
 to NPV 
at a 10.0 
discount rate, 
which represents 
Coronado s 
estimate of 
the nominal dollar, 
risk 
 adjusted 
weighted 
average 
cost 
of 
capital WACC) 
for 
likely 
market 
participants 
if 
the 
subject 
 reserves 
were 
offered 
for 
sale. 
On 
an 
un-levered 
basis, 
the 
NPV 
of 
the 
project 
cash 
flows 
 represents 
the Enterpris 
e 
Value 
of the 
project 
and amounts 
to 
 1.562 billion. 
The pre-feasibility 
 financial 
model 
prepared 
for 
the 
TRS 
was 
developed 
to 
test 
the 
economic 
viability 
of 
each 
coal 
 resource 
area. 
The 
NPV 
estimate 
was 
made 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
confirming 
the 
economics 
for 
 classification 
of 
coal 
reserves 
and 
not 
for 
purposes 
of 
valuing 
Coronado 
or 
its 
Buchanan 
assets. 

 Mine 
plans 
were 
not 
optimized, 
and 
actual 
results 
of 
the 
operations 
may 
be 
different, 
but 
in 
all 
 cases, the mine production plan assumes the properties are under competent management.

 Sensitivity Analysis 
 Sensitivity 
of the 
NPV 
results 
to 
changes 
in 
the 
key 
drivers 
is presented 
in the 
chart below. 
The 
 sensitivity study shows 
the NPV at 
the 10.0 discount rate 
when Base Case sales 
prices, operating 
 costs, and capital costs are increased and decreased in increments 
of 5 within a +/- 15 range. 
 Figure 1-4: 
Sensitivity of NPV 
 As 
shown, 
NPV 
is 
quite 
sensitive 
to 
changes 
in 
sales 
price 
and 
operating 
cost 
estimates, 
and 
 slightly sensitive to changes in capital cost estimates.

 Conclusion and Recommendations 
 Sufficient 
data 
have 
been 
obtained 
through 
various 
exploration 
and 
sampling 
programs 
and 
 mining 
operations 
to 
support 
the 
geological 
interpretations 
of 
seam 
structure 
and 
thickness 
for 
 coal 
horizons 
situated 
on 
the 
Property. 
The 
data 
are 
of 
sufficient 
quantity 
and 
reliability 
to 
 reasonably support the coal resource and coal reserve estimates in this TRS. 
 The 
geological 
data 
and 
preliminary 
feasibility 
study, 
which 
consider 
mining 
plans, 
revenue, 
and 
 operating 
and 
capital 
cost 
estimates 
are 
sufficient 
to 
support 
the 
classification 
of 
coal 
reserves 
 provided herein.

study concludes 
 that 
the 
92.9 
Mt 
of 
marketable 
underground 
coal 
reserves 
identified 
on 
the 
Property 
are 
 economically 
mineable 
under 
reasonable 
expectations 
of 
market 
prices 
for 
metallurgical 
coal 
 products, estimated operation costs, 
and capital expenditures.

 Note: While the sources of data listed in Table 2-1 are not exhaustive, they represent a significant portion of information which supports this TRS. 

 MM A reviewed the provided data and found it to be reasonable prior to incorporating it into the TRS. 
The TRS contains forward-looking 
 information including forecasts of productivity and annual coal production, operating and capital cost estimates, coals sales price forecasts, the 
 assumption that Coronado will continue to acquire necessary permits, and other assumptions. 
The TRS statements and conclusions are not a 
 guarantee of future performance and undue reliance should not be placed on them. 
The ability of Coronado to recover the estimated coal reserves 
 is dependent on multiple factors beyond the control of MM A including, but not limited to geologic factors, mining conditions, 
regulatory 
 approvals, and changes in regulations. 
In all cases, the plans assume the Property is under competent management.
 Coronado engaged MM A to conduct a coal resource and reserve evaluation 
of the Coronado coal 
 properties 
as 
of 
September 
30, 
2022. 
Additions 
and

the 
 Resource 
and Reserve 
estimates forward 
to December 
31, 2022, 
the effective 
date of 
this TRS 
for 
 Buchanan. 
For the evaluation, the following tasks were 
to be completed:

> 
 Conduct site visits of the mines and mine infrastructure facilities; 

 > 
 Process 
the

 Property Description 
 3.1
 Location 
 The 
Buchanan Mine 
Complex 
is located 
in Buchanan 
County 
in southwestern 
Virginia 
(see 
 Figure 
 1-1) 
approximately 
16 
kilometers 
southeast 
of 
Grundy, 
which 
is 
the 
county 
seat 
of 
Buchanan 
 County. 
Surface 
facilities 
for 
the 
shaft 
mine 
are 
located 
along 
Garden 
Creek 
and 
a 
Norfolk 
 Southern (NS) rail line about 6.4 kilometers south-southeast of Oakwood, Virginia. 
 The 
Property 
is 
located 
on 
the 
following 
 United 
States 
Geological 
Survey USGS)
 
Quadrangles: 
 Prater, 
Vansant, Keen 
Mountain, and Jewell Ridge. 
Current mining projections fall 
within the Keen 
 Mountain and Jewell 
Ridge quadrangles. 
The coordinate 
system and datum 
used for the 
model of 
 Buchanan 
No. 
1 
and 
the 
subsequent 
maps 
were 
produced 
in 
the 
Virginia 
State 
Plane 
South 
 system, NAD 27. 

 3.2
 Titles, Claims or Leases 
 The 
Buchanan 
coal 
reserves 
are 
located 
in 
Buchanan 
and 
Tazewell 
Counties, 
Virginia. 
The 
 Property 
is 
composed 
of 
approximately 
33,577 
total 
hectares, 
of 
which 
25,852 
are 
leased 
or 
 subleased 
from 
private 
landholders 
under 
approximately 
150 
individual 
coal 
lease 
tracts, 
and 
 7,725 
hectares 
are 
owned 
by 
Coronado. 
Subject 
to 
Coronado s 
exercising 
its 
renewal 
rights 
 thereunder, 
all the leases 
expire upon 
exhaustion of 
the relevant 
coal reserves, 
which is expected 
 to occur in 2044. 
MM A has not carried 
out a separate 
title verification for 
the coal property 
and 
 has 
not 
verified 
leases, 
deeds, 
surveys, 
or 
other 
property 
control 
instruments 
pertinent 
to 
the 
 subject 
resources. 
Tenure 
was 
separately 
reviewed 
by 
Coronado s 
legal 
advisors. 
Coronado 
has 
 represented 
to MM A 
that it 
controls 
the mining 
rights to 
the reserves 
as shown 
on its 
property 
 maps, and MM A 
has accepted these 
as being a 
true and accurate 
depiction of the 
mineral rights 
 controlled 
by 
Coronado. 
The 
TRS 
assumes 
the 
Property 
is 
developed 
under 
responsible 
and 
 experienced management. 
 3.3
 Mineral Rights 
 Coronado 
supplied 
property 
control 
maps 
to 
MM A 
related 
to 
properties 
for 
which 
mineral 
 and/or 
surface 
property 
are 
controlled 
by 
Coronado. 
While 
MM A 
accepted 
these 
 representations 
as being 
true and 
accurate, 
MM A has 
no knowledge 
of past 
property boundary 
 disputes 
or 
other 
concerns, 
through 
past 
knowledge 
of 
the 
Property, 
that 
would 
signal 
concern 
 over future mining operations or development potential. 
 Property control 
in Appalachia 
can be 
intricate. 
Coal mining 
properties are 
typically composed 
of 
 numerous property 
tracts which 
are owned 
and/or leased 
from both 
land-holding companies 
and 
 private 
individuals 
or 
companies. 
It 
is 
common 
to 
encounter 
severed 
ownership, 
with 
different 
 entities 
or individuals 
controlling 
the 
surface 
and mineral 
rights. 
Mineral 
control 
in the 
region 
is 
 typically 
characterized 
by 
leases 
or 
ownership 
of 
larger 
tracts 
of 
land, 
with 
surface 
control 
 generally comprised of smaller tracts, particularly in developed areas.

 Legal 
mining 
rights 
may 
reflect 
a 
combination 
of 
fee 
or 
mineral 
ownership 
and 
fee 
or 
mineral 
 leases 
of 
coal 
lands 
through 
various 
surface 
and 
mineral 
lease 
agreements. 
There 
is 
also 
a 
 relatively 
small 
amount 
of 
area 
where 
the 
coal 
is 
partially 
owned 
and/or 
partially 
leased 
on 
a 
 limited number of individual tracts. 

 Control 
of 
the 
surface 
property 
is 
necessary 
to 
conduct 
surface 
mining 
but 
is 
not 
necessary 
to 
 conduct 
underground 
mining. 
Given that 
the Buchanan 
Mine has 
been active 
dating back 
to the 
 1980s, Coronado, 
and its predecessors, 
have a 
successful history of 
obtaining any 
necessary rights 
 and the associated permits to mine. 
 3.4
 Encumbrances 
 No 
Title 
Encumbrances 
are 
known. 
By 
assignment, 
MM A 
did 
not 
complete 
an 
independent 
 query related to Title Encumbrances. 

 3.5
 Other Risks 
 There 
is 
always 
risk 
involved 
in 
property 
control. 
Coronado 
and 
its 
predecessor, 
CONSOL, 
have 
 both 
had 
their 
legal 
teams 
examine 
the 
deeds 
and 
title 
control 
in 
order 
to 
minimize 
the 
risk. 

 Historically, 
property control has not posed any challenges related 
to Buchanan s operations.

 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 
 Infrastructure and Physiography 
 4.1
 Topography, 
Elevation, and Vegetation 
 The 
topography 
of 
the 
area 
surrounding 
the 
Buchanan 
Mine 
Complex 
is 
typical 
of 
the 
Central 
 Appalachian Plateau being rugged and deeply dissected 
by v-shaped river valleys 
flanked by steep-
 sided 
upland 
regions. 
Surface 
elevations 
near 
the 
mine 
complex 
range 
from 
approximately 
823 
 meters 
above 
sea 
level 
in 
upland 
regions 
to 
approximately 
579 
meters 
at 
stream 
level. 
The 
 Property is moderately 
vegetated, with a mixture 
of hardwood and conifer forest 
in the temperate 
 broadleaf 
category. 
The 
Property 
is 
not 
situated 
near 
any 
major 
urban 
centers, 
and 
the 
 surrounding area is considered rural. 
 4.2
 Access and Transport 
 General 
access to 
the Buchanan 
No. 1 
Mine property 
is via 
a well-developed 
network of 
primary, 
 secondary, 
and unimproved roads. 
Highway 460 is the primary highway 
connecting Pike County in 
 Eastern 
Kentucky 
to 
Buchanan 
and 
Tazewell 
Counties 
in 
Southwestern 
Virginia. 
Numerous 
 secondary 
and 
unimproved 
roads 
provide 
direct 
access 
to 
the 
Property, 
some 
being 
state- 
and 
 town-maintained. 
These roads 
typically stay 
open throughout 
the year. 
A 
 Norfolk Southern NS)
 rail 
line 
that 
is 
located 
approximately 
6.44 
kilometers 
south-southeast 
of 
Oakwood, 
Virginia, 
 serves 
as 
the 
primary 
means 
of 
transport 
for 
produced 
coal. 
NS 
transports 
coal 
from 
the 
 Buchanan Mine Complex 
either to domestic 
customers or to 
the Pier 6 export 
terminal at Norfolk, 
 Virginia 
for 
overseas 
shipment. 
A 
small 
portion 
of 
production 
is 
transported 
via 
truck 
haul.

 Proximity to Population Centers 
 The 
Buchanan 
No. 
1 
Mine 
property 
lies 
near 
the 
town 
of 
Grundy 
in 
Buchanan 
County, 
Virginia 
 approximately 
290 kilometers 
southeast of 
Lexington, 
Kentucky 
and 153 
kilometers 
southwest 
of 
 Roanoke, 
Virginia. 
As 
of 
2021, 
Buchanan 
County 
had 
a 
population 
of 
approximately 
19,800 
 residents. 

 4.4
 Climate and Length of Operating Season 
 The 
climate 
of 
the 
region 
is 
classified 
as 
humid 
sub-tropical 
with 
four 
distinct 
seasons: 
warm 
 summers, 
cold 
winters, 
and 
moderate 
fall 
and 
spring 
seasons. 
Precipitation 
in 
the 
region 
is 
 consistent 
throughout 
the 
year 
with 
the 
most 
rain 
falling 
in 
spring 
and 
the 
early 
months 
of 
 summer. 
Average 
yearly 
rainfall 
is 
112.62 
centimeters. 
Summer 
months 
typically 
begin 
in 
late 
 May 
and 
end 
in 
early 
September 
and 
range 
in 
average 
temperature 
from 
49 
to 
84 
degrees 
 Fahrenheit (or 9.44 to 28.89 degrees Celsius). 
Winters typically begin in mid to late 
November and 
 run until 
mid to 
late March 
with average 
temperatures 
ranging from 
26 to 
56 degrees 
Fahrenheit 
 (or 
-3.33 
to 
13.33 
degrees 
Celsius). 
Precipitation 
in 
the 
winter 
typically 
comes 
in 
the 
form 
of 
 snowfall 
or as 
a wintery 
mix (sleet 
and snow) 
with severe 
snowfall events 
occurring occasionally. 

 Seasonal 
variations 
in 
climate 
typically 
do 
not 
affect 
underground 
mining 
in 
Virginia. 
However, 
 weather 
events 
could 
potentially 
negatively 
impact 
efficiency 
of 
surface 
and 
preparation 
plant 
 operations on a very limited basis and lasting less than a few days. 
 4.5
 Infrastructure 
 The 
Buchanan No. 
1 Mine 
Complex 
has 
sources 
of water, 
power, 
personnel, 
and 
supplies readily 
 available 
for use. 
Personnel 
have historically 
been sourced 
from the 
surrounding communities 
in 
 Buchanan, Tazewell, 
McDowell, and Pike 
counties, and have 
proven to 
be adequate in 
numbers to 
 operate 
the 
mine. 
As 
mining 
is 
common 
in 
the 
surrounding 
areas, 
the 
workforce 
is 
generally 
 familiar 
with 
mining 
practices, 
and 
many 
are 
experienced 
miners. 
Water 
is 
sourced 
locally 
from 
 streams 
that 
flow 
over 
Coronado-owned 
property. 
The 
mine 
also 
utilizes 
ground 
water 
from 
an 
 old 
abandoned 
mine. 
Electricity 
is 
sourced 
from 
 American 
Electric 
Power
 AEP)
 . 
The 
service 
 industry in 
the areas 
surrounding the 
mine complex 
has historically 
provided supplies, 
equipment 
 repairs 
and fabrication, 
etc. 
The Coronado-owned 
Buchanan Preparation 
Plant services 
the mine 
 via 
a 
skip 
hoist 
and 
conveyor 
belt 
system 
which 
transports 
extracted 
coal 
from 
an 
underground 
 bunker 
to 
the 
surface 
facility. 
The 
NS 
rail 
line 
serves 
as 
the 
main 
means 
of 
transport 
from 
the 
 mine.

 History 
 5.1
 Previous Operation 
 The 
Property 
was 
formerly 
controlled 
by 
 Consolidation 
Coal 
Company CONSOL)
 . 

 Mine 
 development 
was 
started 
by CONSOL 
in 1983 
and longwall 
production 
began 
in 1987. 
Coronado 
 acquired the Buchanan Mine from CONSOL in March 2016. 
 The 
most 
productive 
mining 
of 
any 
period 
since 
1987 
has 
occurred 
since 
the 
acquisition 
of 
 Buchanan Mine by Coronado. 
Production history has been approximately 3.5 
Mt in 2016 (in only a 
 9-month period), 
4.9 Mt 
in 2017, 
4.7 Mt 
in 2018, 
4.5 Mt 
in 2019, 
3.4 Mt 
in 2020, 
4.4 Mt 
in 2021, 
 and 3.9 Mt in 2022. 
 5.2
 Previous Exploration 
 The Property has 
been extensively 
explored by subsurface 
drilling efforts carried 
out by numerous 
 entities, 
many 
of 
which 
were 
completed 
prior 
to 
acquisition 
by 
Coronado. 
The 
majority 
of 
the 
 drilling was accomplished using vertical continuous (diamond) coring or air rotary methods. 
 Drill records 
indicate that 
independent contract 
drilling operators 
have 
typically been 
engaged 
to 
 carry out drilling on the Property. 
Geophysical logging on those 
properties acquired from 
CONSOL 
 was 
often 
performed 
by 
both 
CONSOL s 
in-house 
logging 
services 
and 
outside 
logging 
firms. 

 MM A, via its Geophysical Logging Systems subsidiary, 
has logged a significant number of the past 
 exploration holes and degas wells, and currently logs most 
of the recently drilled holes.

 Geological Setting, Mineralization and Deposit 
 6.1
 Regional, Local and Property Geology 
 The 
Property 
lies in 
the Central 
Appalachian Coal 
basin 
in the 
Appalachian Plateau 
physiographic 
 province. 

 The coal deposits in the eastern 
US are the oldest and 
most extensively developed 
coal deposits in 
 the 
country. 
The 
coal 
deposits 
on 
the 
Property 
are 
Carboniferous 
in 
age, 
being 
of 
the 
 Pennsylvanian 
system. 
Overall, 
these 
Carboniferous 
coals 
contain 
two-fifths 
of 
the 
US s 
 bituminous 
coal 
deposits 
and 
extend 
over 
1,448 
kilometers 
from 
northern 
Alabama 
to 
 Pennsylvania 
and 
are 
part 
of 
what 
is known 
as 
the 
 Appalachian Basin
 . 
The 
Appalachian 
Basin 
is 
 more 
than 
402 
kilometers 
wide 
and, 
in 
some 
portions, 
contains 
over 
60 
coal 
seams 
of 
varying 
 economic significance. 
 Seams of economic significance 
typically range between 
0.30 meters and 1.83 
meters in thickness, 
 with relatively 
little structural 
deformation. 
Regional structure 
is typically characterized 
by gently 
 dipping strata to the northwest 
at less than one percent.

 Exploration 
 7.1
 Nature and Extent of Exploration 
 Extensive 
exploration 
in the 
form 
of subsurface 
drill efforts 
has been 
carried out 
on the 
Property 
 by numerous entities, 
most of which efforts 
were completed 
prior to the acquisition 
by Coronado. 

 Diamond core, rotary, 
and CBM drilling are the three primary types of exploration on the Property. 

 Data 
for 
correlation 
and 
mining 
conditions 
are 
derived 
from 
core 
descriptions 
and 
geophysical 
 logging (e-logging). 
Coal quality analyses were also employed 
during the core exploration 
process. 

 A 
total 
of 
4,589 
core, 
rotary, 
channel 
samples, 
mine 
measurements, 
and 
CBM 
wells 
with 
 Pocahontas 
No. 3 seam information 
are found within 
the Coronado database, 
of which 1,784 data 
 points are located within the current 
mine / resource area. 
The location of the drilling is shown on

 The 
concentration 
of 
exploration 
varies 
slightly 
across 
the 
Property, 
with 
the 
proposed 
 underground mining areas 
having the highest 
concentration of drill 
holes. 
Drilling on the Property 
 is typically 
sufficient 
for 
delineation 
of potential 
underground 
mineable benches. 
Core 
logging is 
 typically conducted by professional 
geologists in cases where roof 
and floor strata are 
of particular 
 interest and in cases where greater resolution 
and geologic detail are needed. 

 However, 
much 
of 
the 
early 
drill 
hole 
data 
comes 
from 
simplified 
driller s 
logs, 
which 
often 
lack 
 specific 
details 
regarding 
geotechnical 
conditions 
and 
specific 
geology, 
making 
correlations 
and 
 floor 
and 
roof 
conditions 
difficult 
to 
determine. 
Geophysical 
logging 
techniques, 
by 
contrast, 
 document 
some 
details 
useful 
for 
geologic 
interpretation 
and 
mining 
conditions, 
but 
do 
not 
 provide detailed lithologic 
information. 
Given the variability 
of data-gathering 
methods, definitive 
 mapping of future mining 
conditions may not be 
possible, but projections and 
assumptions can be 
 made within a reasonable degree of certainty. 
 Once 
the 
integrity 
of 
the 
database 
was 
established, 
stratigraphic 
columnar 
sections 
were 
 generated 
using 
cross-sectional 
analysis 
to 
establish 
or 
confirm 
coal 
seam 
correlations. 
Cross-

mineable bench configurations 
are presented below

 Figure 7-2: Buchanan Cross-Section, B1 B2 
 Due 
to 
the 
extended 
history 
of 
exploration 
by 
various 
parties 
on 
the 
Property, 
a 
wide 
variety 
of 
 survey techniques 
exist for 
documentation of 
data point 
locations. 
Many of 
the older exploration 
 drill 
holes 
appear 
to 
have 
been 
located 
by 
survey 
and 
more 
recently 
completed 
drill 
holes 
are 
 often 
located 
by 
high-resolution 
Global 
Positioning 
System GPS) 
units. 
However, 
some 
holes 
 appear to have 
been approximately 
located using USGS topography 
maps or other methods which 
 are less accurate. 
Therefore, discretion had 
to be used regarding the accuracy 
for the location and 
 ground surface elevation 
of some of these older drill holes. 
In instances where a drill hole location 
 (or associated 
coal seam 
elevations) 
appeared to 
be inconsistent 
with the 
overall 
structural 
trend 
 (or surface topography 
for surface-mineable 
areas), the data 
point was not 
honored for 
geological 
 modeling. 
Others with apparently minor variances were adjusted and then used by MM A. 

 Surveying of the underground and surface mined areas has been performed by the 
mine operators 
 and/or 
their 
consulting 
surveyors. 
By 
assignment, 
MM A 
did 
not 
verify 
the 
accuracy 
or 
 completeness 
of 
supplied 
mine 
maps 
but 
accepted 
this 
information 
as 
being 
the 
work 
of 
 responsible engineers and surveyors. 
 MM A 
compiled 
comprehensive 
topographic 
map 
files 
by 
selecting 
the 
best 
available 
aerial 
 mapping for each area and filling any gaps with digital USGS topographic 
mapping. 
 7.2
 Non-Drilling Procedures and Parameters 
 To 
supplement 
the 
core 
hole 
quality 
database, 
samples 
have 
been 
collected 
from 
underground 
 channel samples, mine stockpiles, and/or truck / train shipments.

 Drilling Procedures 
 Core 
drilling 
methods 
typically 
utilize 
NX-size 
(5.4 
centimeters) 
or 
similar-sized 
core 
cylinders 
to 
 recover core 
samples, which can be 
used to delineate 
geologic characteristics, 
and for coal 
quality 
 testing 
and geotechnical 
logging. 
For the 
core holes, 
the geophysical 
logs are 
especially useful 
in 
 verifying the core recovery 
of both the coal samples 
(for assurance that 
a sample is representative 
 of 
the 
full 
seam) 
and 
of 
the 
roof 
and 
floor 
rock 
samples 
(for 
evaluating 
ground 
control 
 characteristics of deep mineable coal seams). 

 In 
addition 
to 
core 
holes, 
rotary-drilled 
holes 
also 
exist 
on 
much 
of 
the 
Property. 
Data 
for 
the 
 rotary 
drilled 
holes 
are 
mainly 
derived 
from 
downhole 
geophysical 
logs, 
which 
are 
used 
to 
 interpret coal 
and rock thickness 
and depth 
since logging of the 
drill cuttings 
is not reliable. 
From 
 time to 
time, geological 
staff 
at MM A 
have 
been engaged 
by Coronado 
to interpret 
geophysical 
 logs 
within 
specific 
areas 
of 
interest, 
the 
results 
of 
which 
have 
been 
added 
to 
the 
Coronado 
 geologic 
database. 
Moreover, 
MM A 
field 
geologists 
have 
conducted 
gas 
content 
(desorption) 
 testing of core 
samples as part of an 
ongoing effort to 
assess levels of coalbed 
methane gas CBM) 
 present 
within 
the 
seam. 
Additionally, 
there 
is 
an 
ongoing 
active 
surface 
drilling 
program 
for 
 degassing 
the 
mined 
seam 
ahead 
of 
mining. 
The 
degas 
holes 
are 
typically 
logged 
geophysically, 
 and the resulting 
interpreted data 
are incorporated 
into the geological 
model. 
Exploratory drilling 
 generally 
requires 
drilling 
to 
depths 
of 
over 
305 
meters 
to 
penetrate 
the 
target 
coal 
seam 
at 
 Buchanan. 
 A wide 
variety of 
core 
logging techniques 
exist 
for the 
Property. 
For many 
of the 
core holes, 
the 
 primary 
data 
source 
is 
a 
generalized 
lithology 
description 
by 
the 
driller, 
which 
may 
be 
 supplemented by a 
more detailed core 
log completed by 
a geologist. 
These logs were provided 
to 
 MM A 
as 
a 
geological 
database. 
MM A 
geologists 
were 
not 
involved 
in 
the 
production 
of 
 original 
core 
logs 
but 
did 
perform 
a 
basic 
check 
of 
information 
within 
the 
provided 
database. 

 Where geophysical 
logs for such holes 
are available, they 
were used by MM A 
geologists to verify 
 the coal thickness and core recovery of seams. 

 7.4
 Hydrology 
 Buchanan 
is 
an 
active 
mine 
with 
no 
hydrologic 
concerns 
or 
material 
issues 
experienced 
in 
its 
 history. 
Future mining 
is projected 
to occur 
in areas 
exhibiting similar 
hydrogeological 
conditions 
 as 
past 
mining, 
including 
stream 
undermining, 
undermining 
of 
aquifers, 
and 
mining 
through 
 hydraulically 
fractured 
(frac d) 
coalbed 
methane 
wells. 
Based 
upon 
the 
successful 
history 
of the 
 operation with 
regards to 
hydrogeological 
conditions, MM A 
assumes that 
the operation 
will not 
 be hindered by such issues in the future. 
 7.5
 Geotechnical Data 
 Mining 
plans 
for 
potential 
underground 
mines 
were 
developed 
by 
Coronado 
and 
modified 
by 
 MM A to 
fit current 
property constraints. 
Pillar stability 
was tested 
by MM A 
using the 
 Analysis 
 of Retreat 
Mining Pillar Stability 
(ARMPS) and 
 Analysis of Longwall 
Pillar Stability 
(ALPS)
 
programs 
 that 
were 
developed 
by 
the 
 National 
Institute

 . 

 MM A 
reviewed 
the 
results 
from 
the

ALPS 
analysis 
and 
considered 
them 
in 
the 
 development of the LOM plan.

 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 
 8.1
 Prior to Sending to the Lab 
 Most 
of the 
coal 
samples have 
been obtained 
from 
the Property 
by subsurface 
exploration 
using 
 core drilling 
techniques. 
The protocol 
for preparing 
and testing 
the samples 
has varied 
over time 
 and 
is 
not 
well 
documented 
for 
the 
older 
holes 
drilled 
on 
the 
Property. 
Typical 
core-drilling 
 sampling 
methods 
for 
coal 
in 
the 
United 
States 
involves 
drilling 
through 
the 
seam, removing 
the 
 core 
from the 
barrel, describing 
the lithology, 
wrapping 
the sample 
in a 
sealed plastic 
sleeve 
and 
 placing it lengthwise 
into a covered 
core box, and 
carefully marking hole 
ID and depth intervals 
on 
 each box 
and 
lid, allowing 
the 
core 
to 
be delivered 
to 
a laboratory 
in correct 
stratigraphic 
order, 
 and 
with 
original 
moisture 
content. 
This 
process 
has 
been 
the 
norm 
for 
both 
historical 
and 
 ongoing exploration activities at the Property. 
 This 
work 
is 
typically 
performed 
by 
the 
supervising 
driller, 
geologist, 
or 
company 
personnel. 

 Samples 
are 
most 
often 
delivered 
to 
the 
company 
by 
the 
driller 
after 
each 
shift 
or 
acquired 
by 
 company personnel 
or representatives. 
Most of the 
coal core 
samples were obtained 
by previous 
 or current 
operators 
on the 
Property. 
MM A did 
not participate 
in the 
collection, sampling, 
and 
 analysis of the core samples. 
However, 
it is reasonable to assume, given the consistency 
of quality 
 from 
previous 
operators, 
that 
these 
samples 
were 
generally 
collected 
and 
processed 
under 
 industry 
best 
practices. 
This 
assumption 
is 
based 
on 
MM A s 
familiarity 
with 
the 
operating 
 companies and the companies used to perform the analyses. 
 8.2
 Lab Procedures 
 Coal-quality testing 
has been 
performed over 
many years 
by operating 
companies using 
different 
 laboratories 
and testing 
regimens. 
Some of 
the samples 
have 
raw 
analyses 
and 
washabilities 
on 
 the 
full 
seam 
(with 
coal 
and 
rock 
parting 
layers 
co-mingled) 
and 
are 
mainly 
useful 
for 
 characterizing the 
coal quality for 
projected production 
from underground 
mining. 
Other samples 
 have 
coal 
and 
rock 
analyzed 
separately, 
the 
results 
of 
which 
can 
be 
utilized 
to 
forecast 
 underground 
mining 
quality. 
Care 
has 
been 
taken 
to 
use 
only 
those 
analyses 
that 
are 
 representative 
of 
the 
coal 
quality 
parameters 
for 
the 
appropriate 
mining 
type 
for 
each 
sample. 

 Unlike 
many 
Appalachian properties, 
Buchanan has 
interest 
in 
a 
single deep-mineable 
seam, 
the 
 Pocahontas 
No. 
3 
seam; 
therefore, 
the 
analyses 
have 
been 
conducted 
following 
a 
consistent 
 protocol. 
 Standard procedure 
upon receipt 
of core 
samples by 
the testing 
laboratory is 
to: 1) 
log the 
depth 
 and 
thickness 
of 
the 
sample; 
then 
2) 
perform 
testing 
as 
specified 
by 
a 
representative 
of 
the 
 operating company. 

 Samples 
are 
analyzed 
in 
accordance 
with 
procedures 
defined 
under 
 ASTM 
International ASTM)
 standards 
including, 
but 
not 
limited 
to 
(not 
all 
analytical 
tests 
identified 
in 
the 
list 
below 
have 
 been 
run 
on 
each 
sample): 
washability 
(ASTM 
D4371); 
ash 
(ASTM 
D3174); 
sulfur 
(ASTM 
D4239); 
 Btu/lb. (ASTM D5865); volatile matter (ASTM D3175); Free Swell 
Index FSI) (ASTM D720).

 While 
not 
confirmed 
by 
MM A, 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
best 
practices 
and 
ASTM 
(or 
equivalent 
 standards at the time of testing) were utilized 
in laboratory quality testing. 
 9
 Data Verification 
 9.1
 Procedures of Qualified Person 
 MM A 
reviewed 
the 
digital 
geologic 
database 
supplied 
by 
Coronado. 
The 
database 
consists 
of 
 data 
records, 
which 
include 
drill 
hole 
information 
for 
holes 
that 
lie 
within 
and 
adjacent 
to 
the 
 Property 
and 
records 
for 
numerous 
supplemental 
coal 
seam 
thickness 
measurements. 
Upon 
 completion 
of the 
database 
verification, 
copies of 
each entry 
were 
printed, 
and cross 
referenced 
 to 
the 
original 
document 
for 
verification. 
Once 
the 
initial 
integrity 
of 
the 
database 
was 
 established, 
stratigraphic 
columnar 
sections 
were 
generated 
using 
cross-sectional 
analysis 
to 
 establish 
or 
confirm 
coal-seam 
correlations. 
Geophysical 
logs 
were 
used 
wherever 
available 
to 
 assist in 
confirming the 
seam correlation 
and to 
verify proper 
seam thickness 
measurements 
and 
 recovery of coal samples. 

 After 
establishing 
and/or 
verifying 
proper 
seam 
correlation, 
seam 
data-control 
maps 
and 
 geological 
cross-sections 
were 
generated 
and 
again 
used 
to 
verify 
seam 
correlations 
and 
data 
 integrity. 
Once 
the 
database 
was 
fully 
vetted, 
seam 
thickness, base-of-seam 
elevation, 
roof 
and 
 floor lithology, 
and overburden 
maps were 
independently generated 
for use 
in the 
mine planning 
 process. 
 9.2
 Limitations 
 As 
with 
any 
exploration 
program, 
localized 
anomalies 
cannot 
always 
be 
discovered. 
The 
greater 
 the density 
of the 
samples taken, 
the less 
the risk. 
Once an 
area is 
identified as 
being of 
interest 
 for inclusion in the mine plan, additional samples are taken to 
help reduce the risk in those specific 
 areas. 
In 
general, 
provision 
is 
made 
in 
the 
mine 
planning 
portion 
of 
the 
study 
to 
allow 
for 
 localized 
anomalies 
that 
are 
typically 
classed 
more 
as 
a 
nuisance 
than 
a 
hinderance. 
Longwall 
 production has been de-rated in thinner coal zones. 
 9.3
 Opinion of Qualified Person 
 Sufficient 
data 
have 
been 
obtained 
through 
various 
exploration 
and 
sampling 
programs 
and 
 mining 
operations 
to 
support 
the 
geological 
interpretations 
of 
seam 
structure 
and 
thickness 
for 
 coal 
horizons 
situated 
on 
the 
Property. 
The 
data 
are 
of 
sufficient 
quantity 
and 
reliability 
to 
 reasonably support the coal resource and coal reserve estimates in this TRS.

 latter two data types 
are not as prevalent and have 
been supplemented by samples collected from 
 mine stockpiles and either truck- or train-shipment samples. 
 Available 
coal-quality data 
were 
tabulated 
by resource 
area in 
a Microsoft 
EXCEL 
workbook and 
 the 
details 
of 
that 
work 
are 
maintained 
on 
file 
at 
the 
offices 
of 
Coronado 
and 
MM A. 
These 
 tables also 
provide basic 
statistical 
analyses of 
the coal 
quality data 
sets, including 
average 
value; 
 maximum 
and 
minimum 
values; 
and 
the 
number 
of 
samples 
available 
to 
represent 
each 
quality 
 parameter 
of 
the 
seam. 
Coal 
samples 
that 
were 
deemed 
by 
MM A 
geologists 
to 
be 
 unrepresentative 
were 
not 
used 
for 
statistical 
analysis 
of 
coal 
quality, 
as 
documented 
in 
the 
 tabulations. 
A 
representative 
group 
of 
drill 
hole 
samples 
from 
the 
Property 
were 
then 
checked 
 against the original drill laboratory reports to verify 
accuracy and correctness. 
 The 
amount 
and 
areal 
extent 
of 
coal 
sampling 
for 
geological 
data 
is 
generally 
sufficient 
to 
 represent 
the quality 
characteristics 
of the 
coal 
horizons 
and 
allow for 
proper 
market 
placement 
 of the 
subject 
coal 
seams. 
For 
some of 
the 
coal deposits 
there 
are 
considerable 
laboratory 
data 
 from 
core 
samples that 
are 
representative 
of the 
full 
extent 
of the 
resource 
area; 
and for 
others 
 there are 
more limited data 
to represent 
the resource area. 
For example, in 
the active operations 
 with 
considerable 
previous 
mining, 
there 
may 
be 
limited 
quality 
data 
within 
some 
of 
the 
 remaining 
resource 
areas; 
however, 
in those 
cases 
the 
core 
sampling 
data 
can 
be supplemented 
 with 
operational 
data 
from 
mining 
and 
shipped 
quality 
samples 
representative 
of 
the 
resource 
 area. 
 10.2
 Relationship of Tests 
to the Whole 
 The extensive 
sampling and 
testing procedures 
typically followed 
in the 
coal 
industry result 
in an 
 excellent 
correlation 
between 
samples 
and 
marketable 
product. 
Shipped 
analyses 
of 
the 
coal 
 from Buchanan were 
reviewed to verify 
that the coal quality 
and characteristics were 
as expected. 

 Buchanan 
has 
a 
long 
history 
of 
saleable 
production 
in 
the 
low-volatile 
metallurgical 
markets, 
 confirming 
exploration 
results. 
Degradation 
of 
coking 
coal 
characteristics 
over 
time 
is 
not 
 anticipated to be an issue.

 Mineral Resource Estimates 
 MM A 
independently 
created 
a 
geologic 
model 
to 
define 
the 
coal 
resources 
at 
Buchanan. 
Coal 
 resources were estimated 
as of December 31, 2022. 
 11.1
 Assumptions, Parameters and Methodology 
 Geological 
data 
were 
imported 
into 
Carlson 
Mining

(formerly 
SurvCADD 
geological 
modelling 
 software 
in 
the 
form 
of Microsoft

Excel 
files 
incorporating 
drill 
hole 
collars, 
seam 
and 
thickness 
 picks, bottom 
seam elevations 
and raw 
and washed 
coal quality. 
These data 
files were 
validated 
 prior to importing into the software. 
Once imported, a geologic model was created, reviewed, and 
 verified with a key element being a gridded model of coal seam thickness. 

 Resource 
tonnes 
were 
estimated 
by 
using 
the 
seam 
thickness 
grid 
based 
on 
each 
valid 
point 
of 
 observation and 
by defining 
resource confidence 
arcs around 
the points 
of observation. 
Points of 
 observation for 
Measured and 
Indicated confidence 
arcs were 
defined for 
all valid 
drill holes 
that 
 intersected 
the seam 
using standards 
deemed acceptable 
by MM A 
based on 
a detailed 
geologic 
 evaluation and a statistical analysis 
of all drill holes within the projected reserve areas as described 

the JORC Code and United States SEC Regulation S-K

 in 
 Section 11.1.1
 . 
The geological 
evaluation incorporated 
an analysis 
of seam 
thickness related 
to 
 depositional environments, adjacent roof and floor lithologies, and structural influences. 
 After 
validating 
coal 
seam 
data 
and 
establishing 
correlations, 
the 
thickness 
and 
elevation 
for 
 seams 
of 
economic 
interest 
were 
used 
to 
generate 
a 
geologic 
model. 
Due 
to 
the 
relative 
 structural 
simplicity 
of 
the 
deposits 
and 
the 
reasonable 
continuity 
of 
the 
tabular 
coal 
beds, 
the 
 principal 
geological 
interpretation 
necessary 
to 
define 
the 
geometry 
of 
the 
coal 
deposits 
is 
the 
 proper 
modeling 
of 
their 
thickness 
and 
elevation. 
Both 
coal 
thickness 
and 
quality 
data 
are 
 deemed 
by 
MM A 
to 
be 
reasonably 
sufficient 
within 
the 
resource 
areas. 
Therefore, 
there 
is 
a 
 reasonable 
level 
of 
confidence 
in 
the 
geologic 
interpretations 
required 
for 
coal 
resource 
 determination based on the available data and the techniques applied to the data. 
 Table

provides 
the 
geological 
mapping 
and 
coal 
tonnage 
estimation 
criteria 
used 
for 
 the 
coal 
resource 
and 
reserve 
evaluation. 
These 
cut-off 
parameters 
have 
been 
developed 
by 
 MM A based 
on its 
experience with 
the Coronado 
property 
and are 
typical of 
mining operations 
 in 
the 
Central 
Appalachian 
coal 
basin. 
This 
experience 
includes 
technical 
and 
economic 
 evaluations 
of 
numerous 
properties 
in the 
region 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
determining 
the 
economic 
 viability of the subject coal reserves.

 11.1.1
 Geostatistical Analysis for Classification 
 MM A 
completed 
a 
geostatistical 
analysis 
on 
drill 
holes 
within 
the 
reserve 
boundaries 
to 
 determine 
the 
applicability 
of the 
common 
United 
States 
classification 
system 
for 
measured 
and 
 indicated and inferred 
coal resources. 
Historically, 
the United States 
has assumed that coal 
within 
 0.4 
kilometers 
of 
a 
point 
of 
observation 
represents 
a 
measured 
resource 
whereas 
coal 
between 
 0.4 
kilometer 
and 
1.2 
kilometers 
from 
a 
point 
of 
observation 
is 
classified 
as 
indicated. 
Inferred 
 resources are commonly assumed 
to be located between 
1.2 kilometers and 4.8 
kilometers from a 
 point 
of 
observation. 
Per 
SEC 
regulations, 
only 
measured 
and 
indicated 
resources 
may 
be 
 considered for reserve classification, respectively 
as proven and probable reserves. 
 MM A 
performed 
a 
geostatistical 
analysis 
of 
the 
Buchanan data 
set 
using the 
Drill 
Hole 
Spacing 
 Analysis DHSA) 
method. 
This 
method 
attempts 
to 
quantify 
the 
uncertainty 
of 
applying 
a 
 measurement 
from 
a 
central 
location 
to 
increasingly 
larger 
square 
blocks 
and 
provides 
 recommendations 
for determining 
the distances 
between drill 
holes for 
measured, indicated, 
and 
 inferred resources. 
 To 
perform DHSA the data 
set was processed to remove 
any erroneous data points, 
clustered data 
 points, as 
well as 
directional trends. 
This was 
achieved through 
the use 
of histograms, 
as seen 
in 
 Figure 11-1
 , color coded scatter 
plots showing the geospatial positioning 
of the borings, 
 Figure 11-
 2
 , and trend analysis. 
 Figure 11-1: 
Histogram of the Total 
Seam 
 Thickness for the Pocahontas No. 3 Seam Present 
 in the Buchanan Mine Complex 
 Figure 11-2: 
Scatter plot of the Total 
Seam 
 Thickness for the Pocahontas No. 3 Seam Present in 
 the Buchanan Mine Complex 
 Following the completion of 
data processing, a variogram 
of the data set was 
created, 
 Figure 11-3
 . 

 The 
variogram 
plots average 
square difference 
against 
the separation 
distance 
between 
the data 
 pairs. 
The 
separation 
distance 
is broken 
up into 
separate 
bins defined 
by a 
uniform 
lag distance 
 (e.g., for 
a lag 
distance of 
152 meters 
the bins 
would be 
0 
152 meters, 
153 
305 meters, 
etc.). 

 Each 
pair of 
data 
points that 
are 
less than 
one lag 
distance 
apart are 
reported 
in the 
first 
bin. 
If 
 the data 
pair is further 
apart than one 
lag distance 
but less than 
two lag distances 
apart, then the 
 variance 
is reported 
in the 
second 
bin. 
The 
numerical 
average 
for 
differences 
reported 
for 
each 
 bin is then plotted on the 
variogram. 
Care was taken 
to define the lag distance 
in such a way as to 
 not 
overestimate 
any 
nugget 
effect 
present 
in 
the 
data 
set. 
Lastly, 
modeled 
equations,

 spherical, gaussian, or 
exponential, are applied to 
the variogram in order 
to represent the 
data set 
 across a continuous spectrum. 
 Figure 11-3: Variogram of the Total 
Seam Thickness for the Pocahontas No. 3 Seam 

 Present in the Buchanan Mine Complex 
 The estimation 
variance is 
then calculated 
using information 
from the 
modeled variogram 
as well 
 as 
charts 
published 
by 
Journel 
and 
Huijbregts 
(1978). 
This 
value 
estimates 
the 
variance 
from 
 applying 
a 
single 
central 
measurement 
to 
increasingly 
larger 
square 
blocks. 
Care 
was 
taken 
to 
 ensure 
any 
nugget 
effect 
present 
was 
added 
back 
into 
the 
data. 
This 
process 
was 
repeated 
for 
 each test block size. 
 The 
final 
step 
of 
the 
process 
is 
to 
calculate 
the 
global 
estimation 
variance. 
In 
this 
step, 
the 
 number of square blocks that 
would fit inside the selected 
study area is determined for 
each block 
 size 
that 
was 
investigated 
in 
the 
previous 
step. 
The 
estimation 
variance 
is 
then 
divided 
by 
the 
 number 
of 
blocks 
that 
would 
fit 
inside 
the 
study 
area 
for 
each 
test 
block 
size. 
Following 
this 
 determination, 
the 
data 
is 
then 
transformed 
back 
to 
represent 
the 
relative 
error 
in 
the 
95th-
 percentile range. 
 Figure 11-4 
 shows the 
results of 
the DHSA 
performed on 
the Pocahontas 
No. 3 
seam data 
for the 
 Buchanan Mine. 
DHSA provides hole to hole 
spacing values; these distances need to 
be converted 
 to radius 
from a 
central point 
in order 
to compare 
to the 
historical 
standards. 
A summary 
of the 
 radius 
data 
is shown 
in

 Comparing 
the 
results 
of 
the 
DHSA 
to 
the 
historical 
standards, 
it 
is 
evident 
that 
the 
historical 
 standards 
are 
more 
conservative 
than 
even 
the 
most 
conservative 
DHSA 
model 
with 
regards 
to 
 determining 
measured 
resources. 
The 
Exponential 
model 
recommends 
using 
a 
radius 
of 
0.67 
 kilometers 
for 
measured 
resources 
compared 
to 
the 
historical 
value 
of 
0.4 
kilometers. 
With 
 respect 
to 
indicated 
resources, 
the 
DHSA 
falls 
in 
line 
closely 
with 
the 
historical 
standards. 
The 
 Exponential 
and Spherical 
models recommend 
using a 
radius 
1.08 kilometers, 
while the 
Gaussian 
 model 
recommends 
a 
radius 
of 
1.10 
kilometers. 
These 
values 
line 
up 
closely 
with 
the 
historical 
 radius of 1.2 
kilometers. 
These results have 
led the QPs 
to report the 
data following 
the historical 
 classification standards, rather 
than use the results of the DHSA.

 11.3
 Resources Exclusive of Reserves 
 The 
Property 
contains 
multiple 
resource 
blocks 
which 
were 
not 
deemed 
to 
exhibit 
reserve 
 potential 
at the 
time of 
the 
study. 
These 
resources, 
formally 
identified as 
resources 
exclusive 
of 
 reserves, 
are located 
in the 
Pocahontas 
No. 3 
coal seam. 
Reasons which 
may preclude 
elevation 
 of resources to reserves include, but are not limited to: 
 1.
 Insufficient density of drilling and/or coal quality data available 
at the time of this evaluation. 
 2.
 Unfavorable economics 
at the PFS level, yet economics could become attractive 
in the future 
 under different market 
conditions. 

 3.
 Exclusion from LOM planning by mining operator 
due to remaining resource blocks which are 
 relatively small, isolated blocks and not currently attractive 
from an operational perspective. 

 Multiple resource blocks in the active Buchanan Mine have not been considered 
as reserve 
 due to relatively small size and isolation. 
 11.3.1
 Initial Economic Assessment 
 MM A completed an initial economic assessment to 
determine the potential economic viability of 
 resources 
exclusive 
of reserves. 
Unlike 
the economic 
analysis presented 
in 
 Section
 
19 developed 
 to test reserves, the initial economic assessment below is presented 
on a real basis in 2022 dollars. 

 MM A 
applied 
relevant 
technical 
factors 
to 
estimate 
potential 
saleable 
tonnes 
without 
the 
 resource 
blocks, 
should 
the 
resources 
be 
extracted 
via 
deep, 
continuous 
mining 
methods 
(given 
 that their irregular and isolated nature 
 may
 
preclude longwall mining). 

 MM A 
developed 
cash 
cost 
profiles 
for 
the 
resource 
blocks, 
including 
direct 
cash 
costs 
(labor, 
 supplies, 
roof 
control, 
maintenance 
and 
repair, 
power, 
and 
other); 
washing, 
trucking, 
materials 
 handling, general 
and administrative, 
and environmental 
costs; 
and indirect 
cash 
costs 
(royalties, 
 production 
taxes, 
property tax, 
insurance). 
Costs were 
developed 
based off 
relevant 
cost 
drivers 
 (per-meter, 
per-raw-tonne, 
per-clean-tonne). 
Additionally, 
MM A 
estimated 
capital 
costs 
to 
 extract 
resources. 
Capital 
costs 
associated 
with 
mine 
development 
were 
amortized 
across 
the

(0 
 
0.4 
kilometer), 
 indicated
 
(0.4

and 
 inferred
 
(1.2

MM A 
geologists 
and 
engineers 
modeled 
the 
deposit 
and 
 delineated 
mineable 
regions 
to 
reflect 
the 
nature 
of 
each 
seam 
and 
the 
practicality 
of 
mining 
 constraints. 
Based 
on 
MM A s 
geostatistical 
analysis, 
it 
would 
be 
possible 
to 
extend 
the 
 measured arcs slightly 
beyond historically accepted 
practices due to consistent 
geological settings. 

 These results 
have 
led the 
QPs to 
report the 
data following 
the historical 
classification standards, 
 rather than use the results of the DHSA. 
 Based on the data 
review, 
the attendant work 
done to verify the data 
integrity and the creation 
of 
 an 
independent 
geologic model, 
the 
QPs 
believe 
this 
is a 
fair

accurate 
representation 
of the

 Probable Coal Reserves
 
are the economically mineable part of an indicated coal resource, and 
 in some circumstances a measured coal resource, adjusted 
for diluting materials and 
 allowances for losses when the material is mined. 
It is based on appropriate assessment and 
 studies in consideration of and adjusted for 
reasonably assumed modifying factors. 
These 
 assessments demonstrate that extraction 
could be reasonably justified at the time of reporting. 

 Upon 
completion 
of delineation 
and calculation 
of coal 
resources, 
MM A generated 
a LOM 
plan 
 for 
Buchanan. 
The 
footprint 
of the 
reserve 
area 
is 
shown 
on 
the 
map 
in 
 Appendix B
 . 
The 
Mine 
 plan was 
generated 
based on 
the forecast 
mine plan 
and permit 
plan provided 
by Coronado 
with 
 modifications by 
MM A where 
necessary due 
to current 
property control 
limits, modifications 
to 
 geologic mapping, or other factors determined during the evaluation. 
 Carlson 
Mining 
software 
was 
used 
to 
generate 
the 
LOM 
plan 
for 
Buchanan. 
The 
mine 
plan 
was 
 sequenced 
based 
on 
productivity 
schedules 
provided 
by 
Coronado. 
MM A 
judged 
the 
 productivity 
estimates 
and 
plans 
to 
be 
reasonable 
based 
on 
experience 
and 
current 
industry 
 practice. 
 At 
the 
Buchanan 
No. 
1 
Mine, 
a 
minimum 
mining 
height 
of 
1.83 
meters 
was 
used 
due 
to 
the 
 longwall mining method being employed. 
For coal seams thinner than the assigned mining height, 
 the difference 
between the 
coal seam 
height and 
assigned mining 
height consists 
of out-of-seam 
 dilution OSD). 
Mine recovery 
generally varies 
between 40 
and 60 
percent for 
continuous mining 
 panels, 
and 100 
percent 
for 
longwall. 
Plant 
recovery 
is a 
function 
of in-seam 
recovery, 
OSD and 
 plant 
efficiency 
factor, 
which 
is 
set 
at 
95 
percent. 
Typical 
entry 
width 
is 
5.79 
meters 
to 
6.10 
 meters. 
 Raw, 
ROM 
production 
data 
outputs 
from 
LOM 
plan

were 
processed 
into 
Microsoft

and summarized 
on an 
annual basis 
for processing 
into the 
economic model. 

 Average 
seam 
densities 
were 
estimated 
to 
determine 
raw 
coal 
tonnes 
produced 
from 
the 
LOM 
 plan. 
Average 
mine recovery 
and 
wash 
recovery 
factors 
were 
applied to 
determine 
coal 
reserve 
 tonnes. 

 Coal reserve 
tonnes in 
this evaluation 
are reported 
at a 
6.0-percent moisture 
basis and 
represent 
 the saleable product from the Property. 
 Pricing 
data 
as 
provided

 The coal resource 
mapping and estimation 
process described in 
this report was 
used as a basis 
for 
 the coal reserve 
estimate. 
Proven and 
probable coal 
reserves were 
derived from 
the defined coal 
 resource 
considering 
relevant 
processing, 
economic 
(including 
technical 
estimates 
of 
capital, 
 revenue, 
and 
cost), 
marketing, 
legal, 
environmental, 
socio-economic, 
and 
regulatory 
factors 
and 
 are presented on a moist, recoverable 
basis. 
 As is 
customary in 
the US, 
the categories 
for proven 
and probable 
coal reserves 
are based 
on the 
 distances 
from 
valid 
points 
of 
measurement 
as 
determined 
by 
the 
QPs 
for 
the 
area 
under 
 consideration. 
For this 
evaluation, measured 
resource, which 
may convert 
to a 
proven reserve, 
is 
 based on a 0.4-kilometer radius from a valid point of observation. 
 Points 
of observation 
include exploration 
drill holes, 
degas holes, 
and mine 
measurements which 
 have been fully vetted 
and processed into a 
geologic model. 
The geologic model is based on seam 
 depositional 
modeling, 
the 
interrelationship 
of 
overlying 
and 
underlying 
strata 
on 
seam 
 mineability, 
seam 
thickness 
trends, 
the 
impact 
of 
seam 
structure 
(i.e., 
faulting), 
intra-seam 
 characteristics, 
etc. 
Once 
the 
geologic 
model 
was 
completed, 
a 
statistical 
analysis, 
described 
in 
 Section 
11.1.1
 
was 
conducted 
and 
a 
0.4-kilometer 
radius 
from 
a 
valid 
point 
of 
observation 
was 
 selected to define Measured Resources. 

 Likewise, 
the distance 
between 0.4 
and 1.2 of 
a kilometer 
radius was 
selected to 
define Indicated 
 Resources. 
Indicated Resources may convert 
to Probable Reserves. 

 There 
are 
no 
Inferred 
Resources 
(greater 
than 
a 
1.2-kilometer 
radius 
from 
a 
valid 
point 
of 
 observation) at Buchanan. 
 12.2
 Qualified Person s Estimates 
 Reserve tonnage 
estimates provided 
herein report 
coal reserves 
derived from 
the in-situ resource 
 tonnes presented in 
 Table 11-3
 , and not in addition to coal resources. 
Coal reserves are presented 
 on a 
ROM basis 
in 
 Table 
12-1
 . 
Proven 
and probable 
coal reserves 
were derived 
from the 
defined 
 coal 
resource 
considering 
relevant 
mining, 
processing, 
infrastructure, 
economic 
(including 
 estimates 
of 
capital, 
revenue, 
and 
cost), 
marketing, 
legal, 
environmental, 
socio-economic 
and 
 regulatory factors. 
The coal reserves, 
as shown in 
 Table 
12-2
 , are based 
on a technical 
evaluation 
 of 
the 
geology 
and 
a 
preliminary 
feasibility 
study 
of 
the 
coal 
deposits. 
The 
extent 
to 
which 
the 
 coal 
reserves 
may 
be 
affected 
by 
any 
known 
environmental, 
permitting, 
legal, 
title, 
socio-
 economic, 
marketing, 
political, 
or 
other 
relevant 
issues 
has 
been 
reviewed 
rigorously. 
Similarly, 
 the 
extent 
to 
which 
the 
estimates 
of 
coal 
reserves 
may 
be 
materially 
affected 
by 
mining, 
 metallurgical, infrastructure 
and other relevant factors has also been considered.

Note: Marketable reserve tonnes are reported on a moist basis, including a combination of surface and inherent moisture. 
The combination of 
 surface and inherent moisture is modeled 6-percent. 
Actual product moisture is dependent upon multiple geological factors, operational 
 factors, and product contract specifications and can exceed 8-percent. 
As such, the modeled moisture values provide a level of conservatism 
 for reserve reporting. 
 As shown below, 
coal shipments during 2022 (primarily from the northern portion of the Property) 
 exhibit a year-to-date 
average quality comparable 
to quality projected 
from core samples (refer 
to 
 Table 12-2
 
above).

 The 
results 
of 
this 
TRS 
define 
an 
estimated 
92.9 
Mt 
of 
proven 
and 
probable 
marketable 
coal 
 reserves. 
Of that 
total, 94 
percent are 
proven, and 
6 percent 
are probable. 
There are 
14.4 Mt 
of 
 owned 
coal 
reserves 
and 
75.9 
Mt 
of 
leased 
coal 
and 
2.6 
Mt 
of

All 
the 
 Buchanan reserves are considered suitable for the metallurgical 
coal market, and all are assigned.
 12.3
 Qualified Person s Opinion 
 The 
estimate 
of coal 
reserves was 
determined 
in accordance 
with the 
JORC 
Code along 
with SEC 
 Regulation S-K 1300. 
 The 
LOM 
mining 
plan 
for 
Buchanan 
was 
prepared 
to 
the 
level 
of 
preliminary 
feasibility. 
Mine 
 projections 
were 
prepared 
with 
a 
timing 
schedule 
to 
match 
production 
with 
coal 
seam 
 characteristics. 
Production timing 
was carried 
out from 
current locations 
to depletion 
of the 
coal 
 reserve 
area. 
Coal reserve 
estimates 
could be 
materially 
affected 
by the 
risk factors 
described in 
 Section 22.2
 . 

 Based on the preliminary feasibility study and the attendant economic review, 
the QPs believe this 
 is a fair and accurate calculation of the Buchanan coal reserves.

 . 
MM A reviewed 
the 
results 
from 
the 
ARMPS 
and 
 ALPS analysis and considered them in the development of the LOM plan. 
 Hydrology 
has not 
been an 
issue of 
concern at 
Buchanan. 
Based on 
numerous 
site visits 
to both 
 the surface and underground portions of the Property by the QPs, 
it has been determined that this 
 is not 
a significant 
concern. 
Mining of future 
reserves is 
projected to 
occur in areas 
which exhibit 
 similar hydrogeological characteristics 
as those formerly mined areas. 
 13.2
 Production Rates 
 The 
Buchanan 
mine 
is 
active 
with 
six 
continuous 
mining 
sections 
and 
one 
longwall 
section 
 currently operating. 
Operations at Buchanan 
by Coronado and its 
predecessor have been 
ongoing 
 for 
many 
years. 
The 
mine 
plan 
and 
productivity 
expectations 
reflect 
historical 
performance 
and 
 efforts 
have 
been 
made to 
adjust 
the 
plan 
to 
reflect 
future 
conditions. 
MM A 
is confident 
that 
 the 
mine 
plan 
is 
reasonably 
representative 
to 
provide 
an 
accurate 
estimation 
of 
coal 
reserves. 

 Mine development and operation have not been optimized 
within the TRS. 
 Longwall production 
is scheduled 
for 
approximately 
295 to 
312 days 
each year, 
which represents 
 production 
on 
Monday 
through 
Saturday 
with 
allowances 
for 
holidays 
and 
longwall 
moves. 
On 
 each day, 
the continuous 
mining sections 
and longwall 
produce coal 
on three 
shifts. 
The sections 
 are 
configured 
as 
regular 
sections 
with 
one 
continuous 
miner 
available 
for 
production 
on 
each 
 section. 
Productivity is 
planned at 
the rate 
of 18.2 
meters 
to 21.3 
meters 
of advance 
per shift 
of 
 operation for 
the continuous 
miner sections, and 
5.79 meters 
to 7.32 
meters per 
shift of longwall 
 retreat. 
A second longwall is scheduled to begin production in the first quarter of 2025. 
 Carlson 
Mining 
software 
was 
used 
by 
MM A 
to 
generate 
mine 
plans 
for 
the 
underground 
 mineable 
coal 
seam. 
Coronado 
recently 
revised 
the 
Buchanan 
mine 
plan 
with 
an 
independent 
 headgate and 
tailgate for 
longwall panels in 
the South and Northeast 
districts. 
Such a change 
was 
 made 
to 
allow 
for 
an 
effective 
panel 
width 
of 
982 
feet, 
as 
opposed 
to 
an 
effective 
width 
of 
688 
 feet 
used 
previously. 
The 
active 
areas 
in 
the 
North 
and 
East, 
along 
with 
the 
future 
Northwest 
 area, 
are still 
based on 
an effective 
panel width 
of approximately 
688 feet. 
MM A incorporated 
 this mine 
plan revision 
into the 
layout and 
subsequent reserve 
estimates contained 
herein. 
Mine 
 plans were 
sequenced based 
on productivity 
schedules provided 
by Coronado, 
which were 
based 
 on 
historically 
achieved 
productivity 
levels. 
All 
production 
forecasting 
ties 
assumed 
production 
 rates to geological models as constructed 
by MM A s 
team of geologists and mining engineers. 
 As shown in 
 Table 
13-1
 , the areas planned for underground 
production continue until 2044. 
Clean 
 coal production varies directly with coal thickness.

 Mining Related Requirements 
 Although the continuous miner 
sections are significantly more 
expensive to operate 
on a cost-per-
 tonne basis, 
they are 
necessary to open 
up areas 
of the mine 
for the 
longwall. 
At the 
time of this 
 study, 
Buchanan 
had 
6 
operating 
continuous 
miner 
stations 
that 
were 
used 
to 
develop 
main 
 entries and 
gate roads 
in preparation 
for the 
longwall. 
As the mine 
develops, this 
number will 
be 
 able to be reduced. 
 An additional 
requirement at 
Buchanan is the 
drilling of degas 
holes prior to 
mining. 
This process 
 was 
initially 
developed 
as 
a 
safety 
measure 
to 
extract 
methane 
from 
the 
coal 
seam 
prior 
to 
 exposure to the workforce. 
As such, it has been very effective. 
 More 
recently, 
the 
methane 
extracted 
has 
been 
able 
to 
be 
processed 
and 
sold. 
However, 
 degasifying of the coal seam will continue as a safety measure regardless. 
 13.4
 Required Equipment and Personnel 
 The 
Buchanan 
Mine 
is 
currently 
Coronado s 
only 
longwall 
operation. 
The 
longwall 
shearing 
 machine is used 
for extraction 
of coal at 
the production face. 
A chain conveyor 
is used to 
remove 
 coal from 
the longwall 
face for 
discharge 
onto the 
conveyor 
belt which 
then ultimately 
delivers 
it 
 to an 
underground 
storage 
bunker. 
Development for 
the longwall 
is conducted 
by the 
extraction 
 of 
coal 
from 
the 
production 
faces 
using 
continuous 
miners 
and 
haulage 
using 
shuttle 
cars 
to 
a 
 feeder-breaker 
located 
at the 
tail of 
the section 
conveyor 
belt. 
The feeder 
-breaker 
crushes large 
 pieces 
of 
coal 
and 
rock 
and 
regulates 
coal 
feed 
onto 
the 
mine 
conveyor. 
Roof-bolting 
machines 
 are 
used 
to 
support 
the 
roof 
on 
the 
development 
sections 
of 
the 
longwall 
mines. 
Roof-bolting 
 machines are 
used to 
install roof 
bolts, and battery 
scoops are 
available to 
clean the 
mine entries 
 and 
assist 
in 
delivery 
of 
mine 
supplies 
to 
work 
areas. 
Other 
supplemental 
equipment 
such 
as 
 personnel carriers, supply vehicles, etc., are also used daily. 
 Mine 
conveyors 
typically 
range 
in 
width 
up to 
1.83 
meters. 
Multiple 
belt 
flights 
are 
arranged 
in 
 series to 
deliver raw 
coal to 
the underground 
storage. 
Along the 
main and 
sub-main entries 
and 
 panels, a 
travel 
way is 
provided for 
personnel and 
materials by 
rubber-tired 
equipment or 
on rail. 

 The 
Buchanan

Mine 
utilizes 
a 
skip

in 
order 
to 
transport 
ROM 
coal 
from 
the 
 underground storage 
bunker to 
the surface 
where the 
coal may 
be sampled, 
crushed and washed 
 in the preparation plant and stockpiled to await

 Processing and Recovery Methods 
 14.1
 Description or Flowsheet 
 Coronado currently 
operates a 
coal preparation 
plant at 
Buchanan. 
The Buchanan Plant 
operates 
 at 
a feed 
rate 
of approximately 
1,270 raw 
tonnes per 
hour tph). 
Coarse 
material 
is washed 
in a 
 heavy 
medium 
vessel, 
the 
intermediate-size 
material 
is 
washed 
in 
heavy 
medium 
cyclones 
and 
 fine 
material 
is 
washed 
using 
froth 
flotation. 
These 
processes 
are 
supported 
by 
the 
requisite 
 screens, 
centrifuges, 
vacuum 
filters, 
sumps, 
pumps, 
and 
distribution 
systems. 
Processes 
and 
 equipment 
are typical 
of those 
used in 
the coal 
industry and 
are in 
use in 
nearly all 
plants in 
the 
 Central Appalachian Basin. 

 14.2
 Requirements for Energy, 
Water, 
Material and Personnel 
 Personnel 
have 
historically 
been 
sourced 
from 
the 
surrounding 
communities 
in 
Buchanan, 
 Tazewell, 
McDowell, 
and 
Pike 
Counties, 
and 
have 
proven 
to 
be 
adequate 
in numbers 
to 
operate 
 the mine. 
As mining is 
common in the 
surrounding areas, 
the workforce 
is generally 
familiar with 
 mining practices, and many are experienced miners. 
 The 
Buchanan No. 
1 Mine 
Complex 
has 
sources 
of water, 
power, 
personnel, 
and 
supplies readily 
 available 
for 
use. 
Water 
is 
sourced 
locally 
from 
a 
nearby 
abandoned 
underground 
mine. 

 Electricity 
is 
sourced 
from 
AEP. 
The 
service industry 
in 
the 
areas 
surrounding 
the 
mine 
complex 
 has historically provided supplies, equipment repairs 
and fabrication, etc.

 Infrastructure 
 The Coronado-owned 
Buchanan Preparation 
Plant services the 
mine via a 
skip hoist 
and conveyor 
 belt 
system 
which 
transports 
extracted 
coal 
from 
an 
underground 
bunker 
to 
the 
surface 
facility. 

 The NS rail line serves as the main means of transport from the mine.

 Market Studies 
 16.1
 Market Description 
 The quality 
characteristics for 
the subject 
coal resources 
and coal 
reserves have 
been reviewed 
in 
 detail 
by MM A. 
The drill 
hole data 
were 
utilized to 
develop 
average 
coal quality 
characteristics 
 for 
the mining 
site. 
These average 
coal 
quality characteristics 
were 
then utilized 
as the 
basis for 
 determining the various markets into which the saleable coal will likely 
be placed. 

 The projected quality specifications for the Buchanan products are 
as shown in

 16.2
 Price Forecasts 
 Coronado 
provided 
MM A 
with 
price 
forecasts 
for 
the 
Buchanan 
operation. 
Customer 
coal 
 pricing is 
derived from 
market 
observed forward 
estimates 
based on 
global economic 
supply and 
 demand 
analysis 
which 
is 
applied 
to 
mine 
plan 
sales 
volumes 
and 
product 
mix 
and 
is 
 supplemented 
with 
Coronado s 
in-house 
knowledge 
of 
applicable 
rail 
transportation 
charges, 
 ocean 
freight 
charges 
and 
port 
charges. 
Concurrent 
with 
the 
active 
operation, 
Buchanan s 
 production 
is 
assumed 
to 
enter 
domestic 
and 
international 
low 
volatile 
coking 
coal 
markets. 

 Pricing 
provided 
by 
Coronado 
assumes 
applicable 
quality 
adjustments. 
Pricing 
was 
provided 
 through calendar year 2044. 

 Coal 
price 
forecasts 
for 
the 
Buchanan 
products 
were 
provided 
by 
Coronado 
for 
various 
coal 
 markets in terms of US nominal dollars per metric tonne. 

 16.3
 Contract Requirements 
 Some contracts are 
necessary for successful marketing 
of the coal. 
For Buchanan, since all mining, 
 preparation and marketing is done in-house, the remaining 
contracts required are: 
 > 
 Transportation
 
 The Mine contracts with NS to transport the coal to either the domestic 
 customers or to the Pier 6 export terminal for 
overseas shipment. 
 > 
 Handling
 
 Contracts for loading vessels for export 
sales are necessary. 
These are typically 
 handled by annual negotiations based on projected shipments. 
 > 
 Sales 
 Sales contracts are a mix of spot and contract sales. 
With the volatility of the market, 
 long-term contracts are not typically written.

 Results of Studies 
 MM A completed 
a Limited Phase 
I Environmental 
Site Assessment ESA) on the 
Property in April 
 2016 
on 
behalf 
of 
Coronado. 
Coronado 
reports 
not 
having 
conducted 
such 
a 
study 
since 
the 
 MM A 
study. 
The 
ESA
 
completed 
by 
MM A 
included 
a 
site 
inspection, 
review 
of 
historical 
 records, 
a 
database 
search 
of 
state 
and 
federal 
regulatory 
records 
and 
interviews 
to 
identify 
 potential 
recognized 
environmental 
conditions RECs) 
that 
may 
create 
environmental 
liability 
for 
 the sites. 
MM A concluded that no long-term liabilities existed at the time of the ESA. 
 Based on the 
former ESA 
completed by 
MM A, it is the 
QPs opinion that 
Buchanan generally 
has 
 a 
record 
consistent 
with 
industry 
standards 
regarding 
compliance 
with 
applicable 
mining, 
water 
 quality, 
and 
environmental 
laws. 
Estimated 
costs 
for 
mine 
closure, 
including 
water 
quality 
 monitoring during site reclamation, are included in the financial models.

 Requirements and Plans for Waste 
Disposal 
 Based on 
a study 
commissioned by 
Coronado in 
June 2020, 
the current 
Buchanan refuse 
disposal 
 site adjacent 
to the 
preparation 
plant has 
a capacity 
of 29 
million cubic 
meters CM) as 
currently 
 designed; 
with 
an 
additional 
lift 
(No. 
11), 
the 
capacity 
is 37 
million 
CM. 
Projected 
requirements 
 within 
the 
MM A 
financial 
model 
are 
28.0 
million 
CM. 
Permitting 
for 
such 
an 
expansion 
is 
 anticipated to be achievable. 
 17.3
 Permit Requirements and Status 
 All 
mining 
operations 
are 
subject 
to 
federal 
and 
state 
laws 
and 
must 
obtain 
permits 
to 
operate 
 mines, 
coal 
preparation 
and 
related 
facilities, 
haul 
roads, 
and 
other 
incidental 
surface 
 disturbances 
necessary for 
mining 
to 
occur. 
Permits 
generally 
require 
that 
the 
permittee 
post 
a 
 performance bond 
in an amount 
established by 
the regulatory 
program to 
provide assurance 
that 
 any 
disturbance or 
liability created 
during mining 
operations 
is properly 
restored 
to 
an approved 
 post-mining 
land 
use 
and 
that 
all 
regulations 
and 
requirements 
of 
the 
permits 
are 
fully 
satisfied 
 before 
the 
bond 
is 
returned 
to 
the 
permittee. 
Significant 
penalties 
exist 
for 
any 
permittee 
who 
 fails 
to 
meet 
the 
obligations 
of 
the 
permits 
including 
cessation 
of 
mining 
operations, 
which 
can 
 lead 
to 
potential 
forfeiture 
of 
the 
bond. 
Any 
company, 
and 
its 
directors, 
owners 
and 
officers, 
 which are subject to bond forfeiture 
can be denied future permits under the program.

 New 
permits 
or 
permit 
revisions 
will 
occasionally 
be 
necessary 
to 
facilitate 
the 
expansion 
or 
 addition of new 
mining areas on 
the properties, 
such as amendments 
to existing 
permits and new 
 permits for 
mining of 
reserve areas. 
Exploration permits 
are also 
required. 
Property under 
lease 
 includes provisions for exploration 
among the terms of the lease.

of 
any 
 specific 
prohibition 
of 
mining 
on 
the 
subject 
property 
and 
given

 the context 
of current 
regulations. 
Necessary permits 
are in 
place to 
support current

Property, 
but future 
permits are 
required to 
maintain and 
expand production. 
Portions of 
 the

 Mine Closure Plans 
 Applicable 
regulations 
require 
that 
mines 
be 
properly 
closed, 
and 
reclamation 
commenced 
 immediately 
upon 
abandonment. 
In 
general, 
site 
reclamation 
includes 
removal 
of 
structures, 
 backfilling, 
regrading, 
and 
revegetation 
of 
disturbed 
areas. 
Sediment 
control 
is 
required 
during 
 the establishment 
of vegetation, 
and bond 
release generally 
requires a 
minimum five-year 
period 
 of 
site 
maintenance, 
water 
sampling, 
and 
sediment 
control 
following 
mine 
completion. 
This 
 requirement 
is 
reduced 
to 
two 
years 
for 
certain 
operations 
involving 
re-mining. 
Reclamation 
of 
 underground 
mines 
includes 
closure 
and 
sealing 
of 
mine 
openings 
such 
as 
portals 
and 
shafts 
in 
 addition to the items listed above. 

 Estimated 
costs 
for 
mine closure, 
including water 
quality monitoring 
during site 
reclamation, 
are 
 included 
in 
the 
financial 
model.

 Capital and Operating Costs 
 18.1
 Capital Cost Estimate 
 The production sequence selected for 
a property must consider the proximity 
of each reserve area 
 to 
coal 
preparation 
plants, 
river 
docks 
and 
railroad 
loading 
points, 
along 
with 
suitability 
of 
 production 
equipment 
to 
coal 
seam 
conditions. 
The 
in-place 
infrastructure 
was 
evaluated, 
and 
 any future 
needs were 
planned to 
a level 
suitable for 
a Preliminary 
Feasibility Study 
and included 
 in the Capital Forecast. 
 Coronado 
provided 
MM A 
with 
an 
inventory 
of 
operating 
equipment 
available 
at 
Buchanan. 

 MM A s 
capital 
schedules assume 
that 
major 
equipment 
rebuilds 
occur over 
the 
course 
of each 
 machine s 
remaining 
assumed 
operating 
life. 
Replacement 
equipment 
was 
scheduled 
based 
on 
 MM A s 
experience and 
knowledge of 
mining equipment 
and industry 
standards 
with respect 
to 
 the useful life of such equipment. 
 A summary of the estimated capital for the Property is provided

 Operating Cost Estimate 
 Coronado provided historical and a preliminary five-year 
projection of operating costs for MM A s 
 review. 
MM A used the historical and/or budget cost information 
as a reference and developed a 
 personnel 
schedule 
for 
the 
mine. 
Hourly 
labor 
rates 
and 
salaries 
were 
based 
upon 
information 
 contained 
in 
Coronado s 
financial 
summaries. 
Fringe-benefit 
costs 
were 
developed 
for 
vacation 
 and holidays, 
federal 
and state 
unemployment insurance, 
retirement, workers 
compensation and 
 pneumoconiosis, 
casualty 
and 
life 
insurance, 
healthcare, 
and 
bonuses. 
A 
cost 
factor 
for 
mine 
 supplies was developed that 
relates expenditures to 
mine advance rates 
for roof-control 
costs and 
 other 
mine-supply 
costs 
experienced 
at 
underground 
mines. 
Other 
factors 
were 
developed 
for 
 maintenance and repair costs, rentals, mine power, 
outside services and other direct mining costs. 

 Other 
cost 
factors 
were 
developed 
for 
coal 
preparation 
plant 
processing, 
refuse 
handling, 
coal

 Economic Analysis 
 19.1
 Assumptions, Parameters and Methods 
 A 
pre-feasibility 
LOM 
plan 
was 
prepared 
by 
MM A 
for 
the 
Buchanan 
operations. 
MM A 
 prepared 
mine 
projections 
and 
production 
timing 
forecasts 
based 
on 
coal 
seam 
characteristics. 

 Production 
timing was 
carried out 
from 2023 
to depletion 
(exhaustion) 
of the 
coal reserve 
areas, 
 which is projected for the year 2044. 
All costs and prices are based on 2022 nominal United States 
 dollars. 
 The 
Mine 
plan, 
productivity 
expectations 
and 
cost 
estimates 
generally 
reflect 
historical 
 performance by 
Coronado and 
efforts 
have been 
made to 
adjust plans 
and costs 
to reflect 
future 
 conditions. 
MM A 
is 
confident 
that 
the 
mine 
plan 
and 
financial 
model 
are 
reasonably 
 representative to provide 
an accurate estimation of coal reserves. 
 Capital 
schedules were 
developed by 
MM A for 
mine development, 
infrastructure, 
and on-going 
 capital 
requirements 
for 
the 
life 
of the 
mine. 
Staffing 
levels 
were 
prepared, 
and operating 
costs 
 estimated 
by 
MM A. 
MM A 
utilized 
historical 
cost 
data 
provided 
by 
Coronado 
and 
its 
own 
 knowledge and experience to estimate direct and indirect operating 
costs.

 The 
preliminary 
feasibility 
financial 
model, 
prepared 
for 
this 
TRS, 
was 
developed 
to 
test 
the 
 economic viability of 
the coal reserve 
area. 
The results of 
this financial model 
are not intended 
to 
 represent 
a 
bankable 
feasibility 
study, 
required 
for 
financing 
of 
any 
current 
or 
future 
mining 
 operations, 
but 
are 
intended 
to 
prove 
the 
economic 
viability 
of the 
estimated 
coal 
reserves. 
All 
 costs and prices are based on 2022 nominal United States dollars assuming a 2 inflation rate. 
 On 
an 
unlevered 
basis, 
the 
NPV 
of 
the 
project 
cash 
flows 
after 
taxes 
was 
estimated 
for 
the 
 purpose of classifying 
coal reserves. 
The project cash 
flows, excluding 
debt service, are 
calculated 
 by 
subtracting 
direct 
and 
indirect 
operating 
expenses 
and 
capital 
expenditures 
from 
revenue. 

 Direct 
costs 
include 
labor, 
drilling 
and 
blasting, 
operating 
supplies, 
maintenance 
and 
repairs, 
 facilities costs 
for materials 
handling, coal preparation, 
refuse disposal, 
coal loading, sampling 
and 
 analysis 
services, 
reclamation 
and 
general 
and 
administrative 
costs. 
Indirect 
costs 
include 
 statutory 
and 
legally 
agreed 
upon 
fees 
related 
to 
direct 
extraction 
of 
the 
mineral. 
The 
indirect 
 costs 
are 
the 
federal 
black 
lung 
tax, 
federal 
and 
state 
reclamation 
taxes, 
property 
taxes, 
local 
 transportation 
prior 
to 
delivery 
at 
rail 
or barge 
loading 
sites, 
coal 
production 
royalties, 
sales 
and 
 use taxes, 
income taxes 
and state 
severance 
taxes. 
Coronado s 
historical 
costs 
provided 
a useful 
 reference for MM A s 
cost estimates. 
 Sales 
revenue 
is 
based 
on 
the 
metallurgical 
coal 
price 
information 
provided 
to 
MM A 
by 
 Coronado. 
 Projected 
debt 
service 
is 
excluded 
from 
the 
P L 
and 
cash 
flow 
model 
in 
order 
to 
determine 
 Enterprise Value. 
 The 
financial 
model 
expresses 
coal 
sales 
prices, 
operating 
costs, 
and 
capital 
expenditures 
in 
 current 
day 
dollars 
without adjustment 
for 
inflation. 
Capital 
expenditures 
and 
reclamation 
costs 
 are 
included 
based 
on 
engineering 
estimates 
for 
each 
mine 
by 
year. 
The 
Coronado 
division s 
 existing allocations of administrative 
costs are continued in the future projections. 
 Coronado 
will 
pay 
royalties 
for 
the 
various 
current 
and 
projected 
operations. 
The 
royalty 
rates 
 vary by 
mining method 
and location. 
The royalty 
rates 
for Buchanan 
are estimated 
to be 
4.0 of 
 the sales revenue. 
 The 
projection 
model 
also 
includes 
consolidated 
income 
tax 
calculations 
at 
the 
Coronado 
level, 
 incorporating statutory 
depletion calculations, as well 
as state income 
taxes, and a 
federal tax rate 
 of 
21 . 
To 
the 
extent 
the 
mine 
generates 
net 
operating 
losses 
for 
tax 
purposes, 
the 
losses 
are 
 carried 
over 
to 
offset 
future 
taxable 
income. 
The 
terms 
 cash 
flows 
and 
 project 
cash 
flows 
 used in this report refer to after tax 
cash flows. 
 Consolidated 
cash 
flows 
are 
driven 
by 
annual 
sales 
tonnage, 
which 
at 
steady-state 
level 
ranges 
 from 
a 
peak 
of 
6.5 
million 
tonnes 
in 
2034 
to 
a 
low 
of 
0.7 
million 
tonnes 
in 
2044. 
Projected 
 consolidated 
revenue 
ranges 
from 
 317.8 
million 
to 
 1.019 
billion 
at 
a 
steady 
state. 
Revenue 
 totals 14.2 billion for the project s 
life. 
 Consolidated 
cash 
flow 
from 
operations 
is 
positive 
throughout 
the 
projected 
operating 
period, 
 with 
the 
exception 
of 
post-production 
years, 
due 
to 
end-of-mine 
reclamation 
spending.

 Consolidated cash flow from operations peaks 
at 424.3 million in 2035 and totals 5.2 billion over 
 the project s

Capital expenditures 
total 602.8 
million through 2027 
and 1.4 billion

 Coal price 
forecasts 
for 
coal products 
were prepared

for 
its active 
operations. 
Such 
 prices 
were 
used 
for 
the

input 
into 
the 
financial 
model. 
Sales 
variable 
costs 
such 
as

taxes were based upon the revenue 
input.

 Results 
 The 
pre-feasibility 
financial 
model, 
prepared 
by 
MM A 
for 
this 
TRS, 
was 
developed 
to 
test 
the 
 economic viability of 
each coal resource 
area. 
The results of 
this financial model 
are not intended 
 to represent 
a bankable feasibility 
study, 
as may be 
required for 
financing of any 
current or future 
 mining 
operations 
contemplated 
but 
are 
intended 
to 
prove 
the 
economic 
viability 
of 
the 
 estimated coal reserves. 
Optimization of the LOM plan was outside the scope of the engagement. 
 Figure 19-1
 
shows the annual variance of cash costs per ton. 

 Table 19-1
 
shows LOM tonnage, P L, 
 and EBITDA for Buchanan. 
 Figure 19-1:

 Interpretation and Conclusions 
 22.1
 Conclusion 
 Sufficient 
data 
have 
been 
obtained 
through 
various 
exploration 
and 
sampling 
programs 
and 
 mining 
operations 
to 
support 
the 
geological 
interpretations 
of 
seam 
structure 
and 
thickness 
for 
 coal 
horizons 
situated 
on 
the 
Property. 
The 
data 
are 
of 
sufficient 
quantity 
and 
reliability 
to 
 reasonably support the coal resource and coal reserve estimates 
in this TRS. 
 The 
geological 
data 
and 
preliminary 
feasibility 
study, 
which 
consider 
mining 
plans, 
revenue, 
and 
 operating 
and 
capital 
cost 
estimates 
are 
sufficient 
to 
support 
the 
classification 
of 
coal 
reserves 
 provided herein. 
 This 
geologic 
evaluation 
conducted 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
preliminary 
feasibility 
study 
is 
 sufficient to 
conclude that 
the 92.9 Mt 
of marketable 
underground coal 
reserves identified 
on the 
 Property 
are 
economically 
mineable 
under 
reasonable 
expectations 
of 
market 
prices 
for 
 metallurgical coal products, estimated 
operation costs, and capital expenditures. 
 22.2
 Risk Factors 
 Risks have 
been identified 
for 
operational, 
technical and 
administrative 
subjects addressed 
in the 
 Pre-Feasibility 
Study. 
A risk 
matrix has 
been constructed 
to present 
the risk 
levels for 
all the 
risk 
 factors 
identified 
and 
quantified 
in 
the 
risk 
assessment 
process. 
The 
risk 
matrix 
and 
risk 
 assessment 
process 
are modelled 
according 
to 
the Australian 
and New 
Zealand 
Standard 
on Risk 
 Management (AS/NZS 4360). 

 The 
purpose 
of 
the 
characterization 
of 
the 
project 
risk 
components 
is 
to 
inform 
the 
project 
 stakeholders 
of 
key 
aspects 
of 
the 
Coronado 
projects 
that 
can 
be 
impacted 
by 
events 
whose 
 consequences can affect 
the success of the venture. 
The significance of an impacted 
aspect of the 
 operation 
is 
directly 
related 
to 
both 
the 
probability 
of 
occurrence 
and 
the 
severity 
of 
the 
 consequences. 
The initial risk for 
a risk factor 
is herein defined 
as the risk level 
after the potential 
 impact 
of 
the 
risk 
factor 
is 
addressed 
by 
competent 
and 
prudent 
management 
utilizing 
control 
 measures 
readily 
available. 
Residual 
risk 
for 
a 
risk 
factor 
is 
herein 
defined 
as 
the 
risk 
level 
 following application of 
special mitigation measures if 
management determines that the 
initial risk 
 level 
is 
unacceptable. 
Initial 
risk 
and 
residual 
risk 
can 
be 
quantified 
numerically, 
derived 
by 
the 
 product of values 
assigned to probability 
and consequence ranging 
from very low 
risk to very 
high 
 risk. 

 The 
probability 
and 
consequence 
parameters 
are 
subjective 
numerical 
estimates 
made 
by 
 practiced mine engineers 
and managers. 
Both are assigned values 
from 1 to 
5 for which 
the value 
 1 represents the 
lowest probability 
and least consequence, 
and the value 5 
represents the highest 
 probability 
and 
greatest 
consequence. 
The 
products, 
which 
define 
the 
Risk 
Level, 
are 
classified 
 from very low to very high.

 22.2.1
 Governing Assumptions 
 The listing of the aspects is 
not presumed to be exhaustive. 
Instead that listing is 
presented based 
 on the experiences of the contributors to the TRS. 

 1.
 The probability and consequence ratings are subjectively assigned, and it is assumed that 
 this subjectivity reasonably reflects the condition of the active and projected mine 
 operations. 
 2.
 The Control Measures shown in the matrices presented in this chapter 
are not exhaustive. 

 They represent a condensed collection of activities that the author of the risk assessment 
 section has observed to be effective in coal mining scenarios. 

 3.
 Mitigation Measures listed for each 
risk factor of the operation are not exhaustive. 
The 
 measures listed, however, 
have been observed by the author to be effective. 

 4.
 The monetary values used in ranking the consequences are generally-accepted quantities 
for 
 the coal mining industry. 
 22.2.2
 Limitations 
 The 
risk 
assessment 
proposed 
in 
this 
report 
is 
subject 
to 
the 
limitations 
of 
the 
information 
 currently collected, tested, and interpreted 
at the time of the writing of this report. 
 22.2.3
 Methodology 
 The 
numerical 
quantities 
(i.e., 
risk 
levels) 
attributable 
to 
either 
 initial 
or 
 residual 
risks 
are 
 derived 
by the 
product 
of values 
assigned to 
probability 
and consequence 
ranging 
from 
very low 
 risk to very high risk. 
 R = P x C 
 Where: 
 R = Risk Level 
 P = Probability of Occurrence 
 C = Consequence of Occurrence 
 The 
Probability 
(P) 
and 
Consequence 
(C) 
parameters 
recited 
in 
the 
formula 
are 
subjective 
 numerical estimates 
made by practiced 
mine engineers and 
managers. 
Both P and 
C are assigned 
 integer 
values 
ranging 
from 
1 
to 
5 
for 
which 
the 
value 
1 
represents 
the 
lowest 
probability 
and

 least consequence, 
and the 
value 5 
represents 
the highest 
probability and 
greatest 
consequence. 

 The products (R = P 
x C) which define the Risk Level, 
are thereafter classified 
from very low to 
very 
 high.

 Risk Level (R)

 Low (3 to 5) 
 Moderate (6 to 11) 
 High (12 to 19) 
 Very High (20 to 25) 
 Very 
high 
initial 
risks 
are 
considered 
to 
be 
unacceptable 
and 
require 
corrective 
action 
well 
in 
 advance 
of 
project 
development. 
In 
short, 
measures 
must 
be 
applied to 
reduce 
very 
high 
initial 
 risks to a tolerable level. 

 As 
shown 
and 
discussed 
above, 
after 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
operational, 
technical, 
and 
 administrative 
actions 
that 
have 
been 
applied 
or 
are 
available 
for 
action 
when 
required, 
the 
 residual 
risk can 
be determined. 
The 
residual 
risk provides 
a basis 
for 
the 
management 
team 
to 
 determine 
if the 
residual risk 
level is 
acceptable or 
tolerable. 
If the 
risk level 
is determined 
to be 
 unacceptable, 
further 
actions 
should 
be 
considered 
to 
reduce 
the 
residual 
risk 
to 
acceptable 
or 
 tolerable levels to provide justificati 
on for continuation of the proposed operation. 
 22.2.4
 Development of the Risk Matrix 
 Risks have 
been identified for 
the technical, 
operational, and 
administrative 
subjects addressed 
in 
 the TRS. 
The risk matrix and risk assessment process 
are modelled according to the Australian 
and 
 New Zealand Standard on Risk Management (AS/NZS 4360).

 22.2.8.1
 Geological and Coal Resource 
 Coal 
mining 
is 
accompanied 
by 
risk 
that, 
despite 
exploration 
efforts, 
mining 
areas 
will 
be 
 encountered 
where 
geological 
conditions 
render 
extraction 
of 
the 
resource 
to 
be 
 uneconomic, 
or 
that 
coal 
quality 
characteristics 
disqualify 
the 
product 
for 
sale 
into 
target 
 markets. 
 Offsetting 
the 
geological 
and 
coal 
resource 
risks 
are 
the 
massive 
size 
of 
the 
controlled 
 property which allows 
large areas to 
be mined in 
the preferred 
mine areas sufficiently 
away 
 from 
areas 
where 
coal 
quality 
and 
mineability 
may 
be 
less 
favorable. 
This 
flexibility, 
 combined with the 
extensive work 
done to define the 
reserve, reduces the 
risk at Buchanan 
 below that of other mine properties.

 cancellation of coal sales 
 agreements and damage to 
 reputation.

 can be managed with 
 careful product 
 segregation and 
 blending.

 Mining Plan 
 Occupational 
health 
and 
safety 
risks 
are 
inherent 
in 
mining 
operations. 
Comprehensive 
 training 
and 
retraining 
programs, 
internal 
safety 
audits 
and 
examinations, 
regular 
mine 
 inspections, 
safety 
meetings, 
along 
with 
support 
of 
trained 
fire 
brigades 
and 
mine-rescue 
 teams are 
among activities 
that greatly 
reduce accident 
risks. 
Employee health-monitoring 
 programs 
coupled 
with 
dust 
and 
noise 
monitoring 
and 
abatement 
reduce 
health 
risks 
to 
 miners. 

 As 
underground 
mines 
are 
developed 
and 
extended, 
observation 
of 
geological, 
 hydrogeological 
and 
geotechnical 
conditions 
leads 
to 
modification 
of 
mine 
plans 
and 
 procedures to enable safe work within the mine environments. 
 Highlighted 
below 
are 
selected 
examples 
of 
safety 
and 
external 
factors 
relevant 
to 
 Coronado operations. 
 22.2.8.5.1
 Methane Management 
 Coalbed 
methane 
is 
present 
in 
coal 
operations 
below 
drainage. 
Often 
the 
methane 
 concentration in shallow coal 
seams is at such low levels that 
it can be readily managed with 
 frequent testing and monitoring, vigilance, and routine mine ventilation. 
Very high methane 
 concentrations 
may 
be 
present 
at 
greater 
depths, 
as 
experienced 
in 
the 
Pocahontas

The 
Buchanan

has 
operated 
 safely for many years 
in one of the most intense methane environments 
in the United States 
 through 
careful 
management 
of 
coal

and 
mine-

 Mine Fires 
 Mine fires, 
once common at 
mine operations, 
are rare 
today. 
Most active 
coal miners 
have 
 not 
encountered 
a 
mine 
fire. 
Vastly 
improved 
mine 
power 
and

electrical 
 systems, 
along 
with 
safe

within 
coal 
mines, 
which 
is 
the 
source 
of 
most

that 
occur 
 today, 
is not expected to occur at Buchanan.

 Resource Database 
 The Resource Database is established by the collection,

 storing and processing of data and forms the foundation 
necessary for the 
 estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral 
Reserve. 

 A quality assurance and quality control program 
is essential and must be 
 established to govern the collection of all data. 
In reporting, a Mineral 
 Resource must meet the minimum requirement of reasonable 
prospects for 
 economic extraction . 
This will require the concurrent collection and storage 
 of preliminary economic, mining, metallurgical, environmental, 
legal and 
 social data and other information for use in the estimation 
of MRMR. 

 The Resource Database will include both primary (observation and 
 measurement) and interpreted data. 
It is recommended that data be stored 
 digitally, 
using a documented, standard format and a reliable storage 
medium 
 that allows for easy and complete 
retrieval of the data.

 Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data 
 Criteria
 JORC Code explanation
 Commentary
 Sampling techniques 
 > 
 Nature and quality of sampling (e.g. cut channels, random chips, or specific specialised 
 industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such as 
 downhole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc.). These examples should not be 
 taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling. 
 > 
 Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the appropriate 
 calibration of any measurement tools or systems used. 
 > 
 Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the Public Report. In cases 
 where industry standard work has been done this would be relatively simple (e.g. reverse 
 circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce 
 a 30 g charge for fire assay ). In other cases, more explanation may be required, such 
as where 
 there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual commodities or 
 mineralisation types (e.g. submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information. 
 > 
 Most of the coal samples have been obtained from the Properties by subsurface exploration using 
 core drilling techniques. 
The protocol for preparing and testing the samples has varied over time 
 and is not well documented for the older holes drilled on the Properties. 
 > 
 Typical USA core drilling sampling technique is for the coal core sample, once recovered from the 
 core barrel, to be described then wrapped in a sealed plastic sleeve and placed into a covered core 
 box, which is the length of the sample so that the core can be delivered to a laboratory in relatively 
 intact condition and with original moisture content. 
 > 
 It is reasonable to assume, given the sophistication level of the previous operators, that these 
 samples were generally collected and processed under industry best-practices. 
This assumption is 
 based on MM A s familiarity with the operating companies and the companies used to perform the 
 analysis. 

 > 
 Some of the drill holes were air rotary bored and no coal core samples were collected. 
Seam 
 thickness for rotary-drilled bore holes is verified by calibrated downhole gamma-density logs. 

 > 
 Coal samples that were deemed by MM A geologists to be unrepresentative were not used for 
 statistical analysis of coal quality, as documented in the tabulations. A representative group of drill 
 hole samples from the Properties were then checked against the original drill laboratory reports to 
 verify accuracy and correctness. 

 Drilling techniques 
 > 
 Drill type (e.g. core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, 
 sonic, etc.) and details (e.g. core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, 
 face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc.). 
 > 
 The Properties have been extensively explored by subsurface drilling efforts carried out by 
 numerous entities, most of which were completed prior to acquisition by Coronado. 
The majority of 
 the drilling was accomplished using vertical continuous (diamond) coring or air rotary methods. 
 > 
 Core drilling methods utilize NX-size (5.4 centimeter) or similar-sized core cylinders to recover core 
 samples, which can be used to delineate geologic characteristics, and for coal quality testing and 
 geotechnical logging. 

 > 
 Data for the rotary drilled holes is mainly derived from downhole geophysical logs, which are used to 
 interpret coal and rock thickness and depth since logging of the drill cuttings is not reliable. 
 > 
 Geophysical logging was performed on many of the holes, either by Geological Logging Systems (a 
 division of MM A), other geophysical logging contractors, and on those properties acquired from 
 CONSOL geophysical logging was often performed by CONSOL s in-house logging services.

 Drill sample recovery 
 > 
 Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and results assessed. 
 > 
 Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure representative nature of the 
 samples. 
 > 
 Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and whether sample bias 
 may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material. 
 > 
 Where available, core recovery thickness of coal samples was reconciled with the thickness 
 interpreted from geophysical logs. 
 > 
 Core recovery of the older coal samples lacking geophysical logs is sometimes not well-documented: 
 however, when the laboratory results for such holes had anomalous values, the data was 
 disqualified and not used. 

 Logging 
 > 
 Whether core and chip samples have been geologically and geotechnically logged to a level of 
 detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies and metallurgical 
 studies. 
 > 
 Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature. Core (or costean, channel, etc.) 
 photography. 
 > 
 The total length and percentage of the relevant intersections logged. 
 > 
 A wide variety of core-logging techniques exist for the properties. 
For many of the core holes, the 
 primary data source is a generalized lithology description by the driller, in some cases supplemented 
 by a more detailed core log completed by a geologist. 

 > 
 The logging of core thickness and depth is quantitative. 
With the exception of the coal seams, 
 logging of rock strata type is more subjective and best considered as qualitative. 
 Sub-sampling 
 techniques and sample 
 preparation 
 > 
 If core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, half or all core taken. 
 > 
 If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split, etc. and whether sampled wet or dry. 
 > 
 For all sample types, the nature, quality and appropriateness of the sample preparation 
 technique. 
 > 
 Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-sampling stages to maximise representivity of 
 samples. 
 > 
 Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is representative of the in situ material collected, 
 including for instance results for field duplicate/second-half sampling. 
 > 
 Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the material being sampled. 
 > 
 Typical US practice in the Appalachian Basin is that core samples for deep mineable core samples are 
 not sawn or subsampled (since seams are not of great thickness and the entire seam is mined and 
 co-mingled). 
 > 
 Oftentimes, core for surface-mineable coal seams are bench sampled separately by the various coal 
 and rock layers (plies). 
 > 
 MM A has exercised diligence to use only those analyses that are representative of the coal quality 
 parameters for the appropriate mining type for each sample. 
 Quality of assay data 
 and laboratory tests 
 > 
 The nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and laboratory procedures used and 
 whether the technique is considered partial or total. 
 > 
 For geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld XRF instruments, etc., the parameters used in 
 determining the analysis including instrument make and model, reading times, calibrations 
 factors applied and their derivation, etc. 
 > 
 Nature of quality control procedures adopted (e.g. standards, blanks, duplicates, external 
 laboratory checks) and whether acceptable levels of accuracy (i.e. lack of bias) and precision 
 have been established. 
 > 
 Sample analysis was typically carried out by accredited US laboratories. 

 > 
 Standard procedure upon receipt of core samples by the testing laboratory is to log the depth and 
 thickness of the sample, then perform testing as specified by a representative of the operating 
 company. 
Each sample is then analyzed in accordance with procedures defined under 
 ASTM 
 International ASTM)
 
standards including, but not limited to; washability (ASTM D4371); ash (ASTM 
 D3174); sulfur (ASTM D4239); Btu/lb. (ASTM D5865); volatile matter (ASTM D3175); Free Swell Index 
 FSI) (ASTM D720). 
 > 
 Geophysical tools are calibrated by the logging company and where possible, validated using a 
 calibration hole.

 > 
 The use of twinned holes. 
 > 
 Documentation of primary data, data entry procedures, data verification, data storage 
 (physical and electronic) protocols. 
 > 
 Discuss any adjustment to assay data. 
 > 
 All coal intersection data used to generate the geologic model has been cross referenced with the 
 lithological and geophysical logs by MM A. 
 > 
 Laboratory quality was adjusted from dry basis to reflect the anticipated marketable product 
 moisture. 
 > 
 Coal quality results were verified by spot-check with laboratory analysis sheets by MM A before 
 inclusion into the geologic model and use in the resource estimate. 
 Location of data points 
 > 
 Accuracy and quality of surveys used to locate drill holes (collar and down-hole surveys), 
 trenches, mine workings and other locations used in Mineral Resource estimation. 
 > 
 Specification of the grid system used. 
 > 
 Quality and adequacy of topographic control. 
 > 
 Due to the long history of exploration by various parties on the Properties, a wide variety of survey 
 techniques exist for documentation of data point locations. 
Many of the older exploration drill holes 
 appear to have been located by ground survey; more recently completed drill holes are often 
 located by high-resolution Global Positioning System GPS) units. 
 > 
 Grid systems used are typically the State Plane Coordinate System pertinent to each property. 

 > 
 Topography is based on either the USGS topographic 7.5-minute quadrangle maps or on recent 
 aerial photogrammetry as necessary (subject to availability). 
 Data spacing and 
 distribution 
 > 
 Data spacing for reporting of Exploration Results. 
 > 
 Whether the data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish the degree of geological 
 and grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimation 
 procedure(s) and classifications applied. 
 > 
 Whether sample compositing has been applied. 
 > 
 Spacing and distribution of data point information may vary from seam to seam within each mining 
 area. 
The areas estimated for coal resource and coal reserve tonnes have been limited so that the 
 data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish the degree of geological continuity appropriate 
 for the estimation and classification of the coal tonnes. 

 > 
 All of the coal resource tonnes are in the measured, indicated, and inferred categories, and all of the 
 coal reserve tonnes are in the proved and probable categories in accordance with the JORC Code 
 and SEC standards. 

 Orientation of data in 
 relation to geological 
 structure 
 > 
 Whether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of possible structures and 
 the extent to which this is known, considering the deposit type. 
 > 
 If the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation of key mineralised 
 structures is considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this should be assessed and 
 reported if material. 
 > 
 Drill holes have been vertically drilled. 
No downhole deviation logs have been collected and it is 
 therefore not known if the drill holes have deviated away from vertical. 
Based on the relatively 
 shallow seam depths, any deviation is expected to be insignificant and immaterial to the geologic 
 characterization of the Property. 
 > 
 The dip of the coal seams is relatively minor and not a material issue for representation of seam 
 thickness or quality. 
 Sample security 
 The measures taken to ensure sample security. 
 > 
 Sample handling procedures employed by explorationists follow typical US protocol and should be 
 adequate to insure sample security. 
 Audits or reviews 
 The results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques and data. 
 > 
 MM A has reviewed all available geological information for the Properties in developing the 
 geologic model. 
Only that data deemed suitable has been used for the purpose of generating the 
 resource and reserve estimates.

 > 
 Coronado has represented to MM A that it controls the mining rights to the coal deposits as shown 
 on its property maps, and MM A has accepted these as being a true and accurate depiction of the 
 mineral rights controlled by Coronado. 
The TRS assumes the properties are developed under

 Data aggregation 
 methods 
 > 
 In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or minimum 
 grade truncations (e.g. cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and 
 should be stated. 
 > 
 Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high grade results and longer lengths 
 of low grade results, the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and some 
 typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail. 
 > 
 The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should be clearly stated. 
 > 
 Where a coal seam has been bench sampled (typically for surface mining) the individual analyses for 
 the coal plies are normally weight-averaged to represent the total of recoverable coal. 
 > 
 Coal quality summary results have been documented in the TRS. 
Average coal quality on a per-
 seam basis is used to represent the coal resources within a given mining area. 
 > 
 Average coal quality for each Coronado complex is provided in Tables 1-1, 1-2 and 1-3 of this TRS. 

 > 
 No other data aggregations methods are used. 
 Relationship between 
 mineralisation widths 
 and intercept lengths 
 > 
 These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration Results. 
 > 
 If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole angle is known, its nature 
 should be reported. 
 > 
 If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a clear 
 statement to this effect (e.g. down hole length, true width not known ). 
 > 
 Coal thickness values from all coal intersections and down hole geophysical logs are considered to 
 be vertical thicknesses. 
Seam dip of approximately 2.0 to 3.0 degrees has little effect on the vertical 
 thickness of the seam. 
 Diagrams 
 > 
 Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be included 
 for any significant discovery being reported These should include, but not be limited to a plan 
 view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views. 
 > 
 Diagrams and maps showing the coal seam intercepts are presented in the TRS. 
 Balanced reporting 
 > 
 Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, representative 
 reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading 
 reporting of Exploration Results. 
 > 
 All of the available, qualified exploration data has been included within the tabulations, maps, and 
 diagrams for this TRS. 
 > 
 Both coal thickness and quality data are deemed by MM A to be reasonably sufficient within the 
 resource areas. Therefore, there is a reasonable level of confidence in the geologic interpretations 
 required for coal resource determination based on the available data and the techniques applied to 
 the data. 
 Other substantive 
 exploration data 
 > 
 Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but not 
 limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; 
 bulk samples size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density, 
 groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating 
 substances.

 there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extractions of all coal resources under 
 favorable market conditions.

 The basis for assumptions or predictions regarding metallurgical amenability. It is always 
 necessary as part of the process of determining reasonable prospects for eventual economic

 metallurgical treatment processes and parameters made when reporting Mineral Resources 
 may not always be rigorous. Where this is the case, this should be reported with an 
 explanation of the basis of the metallurgical assumptions made. 
 > 
 The products mined from coal resources controlled by Coronado can be sold into high-, mid-, and 
 low-volatile metallurgical coal markets because of their inherent quality characteristics.

 Coronado may blend production from multiple sources to manage ash and sulfur content along with 
 the rheological and petrographic characteristics of the shipped products. 

 Environmental factors 
 or assumptions 
 > 
 Assumptions made regarding possible waste and process residue disposal options. It is always 
 necessary as part of the process of determining reasonable prospects for eventual economic 
 extraction to consider the potential environmental impacts of the mining and processing 
 operation. 
While at this stage the determination of potential environmental impacts, 
 particularly for a greenfields project, may not always be well advanced, the status of early 
 consideration of these potential environmental impacts should be reported. Where these 
 aspects have not been considered this should be reported with an explanation of the 
 environmental assumptions made.

For contour surface 
 mining, a minimum of 38-meter bench is provided to support HWM.

 HWM and Auger Mining Resources: HWM cut depth (penetration) is established at a maximum of 
 244 meters. 
The minimum mineable coal thickness is limited at 0.6 meters. For coal seams less than 
 0.8 meters thick, roof and/or floor characteristics must allow OSD cutting to maintain a 0.8-meter

 Underground Mining Reserves: 
The planning model assigns minimum mining heights of 1.4 to 1.8 
 meters for mains and panel development. 
At the Buchanan Mine, a minimum mining height of 1.8 
 meters was used due to the longwall mining method being employed. 
For coal seams thinner than 
 the assigned mining height, the difference between the coal seam height and assigned mining 
 height consists of OSD. 
In all cases a minimum of 0.05 meters of OSD was assumed, with the 
 exception of the Mon Valley mines, where a minimum 0.15 meters of OSD was assumed due to 
 weaker floor strata. 
 > 
 Surface Mining Reserves: 
Area mining is generally limited to a cumulative overburden ratio of 30:1 
 and a 15:1 ratio for contour mining. 
Exceptions were considered for mining of metallurgical grade 
 coal where deemed economical. 
It is assumed that careful cleaning of exposed coal pits will result in 
 minimal OSD.

 HWM and Auger Mining Reserves: 
The mining plan assumes that the HWM cutting height is a 
 minimum of 76 to 99 centimeters for clearance purposes. 
When the coal seam is less than 76 to 99 
 centimeters thick, OSD assumed and included in the ROM product.
 Because the auger has very

 Underground Mining Resources: 
The continuous mining method provides for the extraction of coal 
 from the production faces using continuous miners (and longwall shearing machine at Buchanan) 
 and haulage using shuttle cars or battery haulers to a feeder-breaker located at the tail of the 
 section conveyor belt. 
The feeder-breaker crushes large pieces of coal and rock and regulates coal 
 feed onto the mine conveyor. 
A chain conveyor is used to remove coal from the longwall face at the 
 Buchanan Mine for placement onto the conveyor belt which is ultimately delivered to an 
 underground storage bunker. 
Roof-bolting machines are used to install roof bolts, and battery 
 scoops are available to clean the mine entries and assist in delivery of mine supplies to work areas. 

 Surface ventilation fans are installed as needed to provide a sufficient volume of air to ventilate 
 production sections, coal haulage and transport entries, battery charging stations, and transformers 
 in accordance with approved plans. 
 > 
 Coronado currently operates three coal preparation plants, one each at the Buchanan, Logan County 
 and Greenbrier Divisions. 
The Buchanan Plant operates at a feed rate of approximately 907 raw 
 tonnes per hour tph), whereas the Saunders Plant (Logan County Division) has a nominal feed rate 
 of 816 tph, and the Mountaineer Plant (Greenbrier Division) operates at 544 tph.
 MM A has

 Surface Mining Resources: The surface mining mobile equipment spreads advance the contour and 
 area mining pits while systematically reclaiming the trailing side of pits where coal has been 
 removed. 
The coal haul roads are extended and maintained as the pits advance. 
Support facilities 
 are maintained nearby but away from the active mining, and include storage areas for blasting 
 agents, fuel and lubricants, and mine supplies along with maintenance facilities and offices. 
Most of 
 the surface mine production is transported to a loading point for crushing, blending and direct-
 shipment to customers. 

 > 
 HWM and Auger Resources: The HWM equipment advances along with the contour mining pits. 
The 
 rate of advance of the contour mining is governed by the advancement rate of the HWM. 
A diesel-
 powered generator trails the highwall miner and powers the continuous mining unit.

 Coronado operates five underground mines as follows: 
Buchanan Mine at the Buchanan Mine 
 Complex; Winifrede, Eagle No. 1, Muddy Bridge and Lower War Eagle Mines in the Logan Mine 
 Complex; the Mountaineer #1 Mine at the Greenbrier Mine Complex is currently idle. 
 > 
 All ROM production is currently planned for either truck transportation from the mines to the 
 processing or shipping facilities, or in some cases there is either a current or planned mine mouth 
 preparation plant and barge/rail loading facility. 

 > 
 There is a network of public highways that provide serviceable coal haul routes and private, internal 
 roads on the Properties would be developed as may be needed. 
Rail service to the Properties is 
 most readily provided by NS and CSX
 with connections to both domestic consumers and 
 international trans-shipment points. 
NS track is located across the Monongahela River from the 
 proposed Pangburn Hollow load-out facility. 
Coal would be shipped to customers via barge and rail 
 and sold as both metallurgical and thermal products.

 Coronado provided historical and 5-year budget operating costs for its active mines for MM A s 
 review. 
MM A used the historical and/or budget cost information as a reference and developed 
 personnel schedules for each mine. 
Hourly labor rates and salaries were based upon information 
 contained in Coronado s financial summaries. 
Fringe benefit costs were developed for vacation and 
 holidays, federal and state unemployment insurance, retirement, workers compensation and 
 pneumoconiosis, casualty and life insurance, healthcare and bonuses. 
A cost factor for mine 
 supplies was developed that relates expenditures to mine advance rates for roof control costs and 
 other mine supply costs at underground mines. 
Other factors were developed for maintenance and 
 repair costs, rentals, mine power, outside services and other direct mining costs. 
 > 
 Surface mine direct operating costs were developed as a function of overburden ratio for repair and 
 maintenance supplies, diesel fuel, explosives and blasting, and miscellaneous supplies 
and services. 

 Operating costs for highwall mines are based on costs per ROM tonne estimates. 
Other cost factors 
 were developed for coal preparation plant processing, refuse handling, coal loading, trucking, 
 property taxes, and insurance and bonding. 
Appropriate royalty rates were assigned for production 
 from leased coal lands and sales taxes were calculated for state severance taxes, 
the federal black 
 lung excise tax, and federal and state reclamation fees.

The project cash flows, excluding debt service, are calculated by 
 subtracting direct and indirect operating expenses and capital expenditures from revenue. 
Direct 
 costs include labor, drilling and blasting, operating supplies, maintenance and repairs, facilities costs 
 for materials handling, coal preparation, refuse disposal, coal loading, sampling and analysis 
 services, reclamation and general and administrative costs. 
Indirect costs include statutory and 
 legally agreed upon fees related to direct extraction of the mineral. 
The indirect costs are the

 MM A performed a previous audit of the Properties in year 2017 for Coronado based on 
 U.S. 
 Securities and Exchange Commission SEC)
 
Industry Guide 7 standards. 
Earlier audits were 
 performed by various independent consultants for predecessors-in-title to Coronado and at various

 deemed appropriate, a qualitative discussion of the factors which could affect the relative 
 accuracy and confidence of the estimate. 
 > 
 Operations on the Properties by Coronado and its predecessors have been on-going for many years. 

 > 
 MM A is confident that the mine plans and financial models are reasonably representative to 
 provide an accurate estimation of coal reserves. 
 > 
 Mine development and operation have not been optimized within the TRS. 
 > 
 The statement should specify whether it relates to global or local estimates, and, if local, state 
 the relevant tonnages, which should be relevant to technical and economic evaluation. 
 Documentation should include assumptions made and the procedures used. 
 > 
 Proved and probable coal reserve were derived from the defined in-situ coal resource considering 
 relevant processing, economic (including independent estimates of capital, revenue and cost), 
 marketing, legal, environmental, socioeconomic, and regulatory factors on a global scale as current 
 local data reflects the global assumptions. 
 > 
 Accuracy and confidence discussions should extend to specific discussions of any applied 
 Modifying Factors that may have a material impact on Ore Reserve viability, or for which there 
 are remaining areas of uncertainty at the current study stage. 
 The major risk factors for the active Coronado mines and future resource development are summarized below: 
 > 
 Mine Accidents 
 > 
 Highwall Failure. 
Highwall failures are likely to result in a temporary mine closure and should not 
 have a material impact on the mine sustainability. 
The risk is considered to be probable. 

 > 
 Adverse Geological Conditions. 
Adverse geological conditions include such conditions as faults and 
 sandstone washouts. 
The risk is considered to be probable. 
The impact is expected to be temporary 
 with little material impact on mine sustainability. 
 > 
 Environmental Risk. 
Numerous federal and state permits are required to operate coal mines and 
 mine surface facilities. Permitting rules are complex and may change over time, making compliance 
 difficult or impossible. 
 > 
 Water Quality. 
Permit requirements to fulfill Clean Water Act obligations are subject to 
 modification.

 is possible. 
As a contemporary example, the selenium discharge issue that affects western Canadian 
 and Central Appalachian Basin operators has only recently emerged as a concern and its ultimate 
 impact has not been determined. 
 > 
 New Permits. 
Permit protests by environmental groups and individuals can contribute to permit 
 delays or denial and increase the cost of permitting and delay development. 
Surface mining 
 activities, coal refuse disposal and construction of access roads in mountainous terrain often require 
 storage of material in valley fills. 
Authority to dispose of fill material into waters of the United 
 States must be granted by the 
 United States Army Corps of Engineers COE)
 . 
COE permits are 
 increasingly difficult to obtain. 
 > 
 Regulatory Requirements. 
Adverse impact from regulatory changes is considered to be probable. 

 The impact will likely affect the broader industry and is not expected to result in mine closure. 
 > 
 Market Risk. 
Metallurgical and thermal coal markets ultimately depend upon the global steel and 
 thermal coal demand and are considered to be volatile. 
Currently, the US coal market has seen a 
 decline in demand for thermal coal due to thermal plant closures, as a result of new air and water 
 pollution regulations, and competition from other commodities used for power generation such as 
 natural gas. 
This has resulted in an overall decline in CAPP coal production. 
Continued regulatory 
 changes and declining demand could result in material changes in domestic and global coal markets. 

 The impact cannot be predicted at this time; however, while MM A expects the coal reserve within 
 this TRS to remain economically viable throughout the life of the projected mines, the LOM financial 
 model is very sensitive to changes in coal sales price and therefore market risk is not insignificant. 
 > 
 Labor Risk. 
Work stoppage due to organized labor protests is considered to be unlikely and not 
 likely to lead to permanent mine closure. 
The mines are likely to suffer the loss of key supervisors 
 and skilled employees due to retirement as the workforce ages. 
The problem is industry-wide and 
 the impact is expected to be temporary and have no sustained impact on coal production. 
 > 
 Availability of Equipment and Supplies. 
Risk of equipment and supply availability is likely to be 
 temporary and should not have a sustained adverse impact on the production of coal. 
 > 
 Transportation Delay. 
Interruption of coal transport services by river or rail is considered to be 
 probable but unlikely to have a sustained impact on coal production. 
 > 
 It is recognised that this may not be possible or appropriate in all circumstances. These 
 statements of relative accuracy and confidence of the estimate should be compared with 
 production data, where available. 
 > 
 Mine plans, productivity expectations and cost estimates generally reflect historical performance 
 and efforts have been made to adjust plans and costs to reflect future conditions.

 Executive Summary 
 1.1
 Property Description 
 Coronado Global Resources 
Inc. Coronado)
 authorized Marshall Miller 
 Associates, Inc. MM A)
 to prepare this 
Technical Report Summary (TRS) of 
its controlled coal 
resources and reserves 
located 
 at the 
 Logan County 
Complex Logan)
 
in Boone, Logan 
and Wyoming 
Counties, West 
Virginia (the 
 Property). 
An updated 
TRS was 
prepared in 
February 2023 
due to 
material differences 
in the 
key 
 financial modifying factors including coal 
sales price assumptions, operating costs and 
capital costs 
 from 
December 
31, 
2021 
to 
December 
31, 
2022. 
Coal 
sales 
price 
assumptions 
are 
discussed 
in
 Sections 12 
and 16
 
of the TRS, 
while operating 
costs and 
capital costs 
are discussed in 
 Sections 18 
 and 
19
 
of 
the 
TRS. 
The 
report 
provides 
a 
statement 
of 
coal 
resources 
and 
coal 
reserves 
for 
 Coronado, 
as defined 
under the 
 Australasian Code 
for Reporting 
of Exploration 
Results, Mineral 
 Resources 
and 
Ore 
Reserves
 JORC 
Code) 
as 
well

 Ownership 
 The Logan properties started mining in 1945 by 
 Lorado Mining Company
 . 
The properties
 were sold 
 to 
 Buffalo Mining Company
 
in 1964 and then 
to 
 Pittston Coal Company Pittston)
 
in 1971. 
Pittston 
 operated the properties until the early 
1990 s when it idled the mine 
complex and then in 
2004 sold 
 them to 
 Addington Resources
 . 
Production resumed 
in 2005. 

 Imagin Natural 
Resources
 
acquired 
 the properties in 2007 and 
then sold them to 
 Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. Cliffs)
 
in 2011, which in 
turn sold 
 the properties to Coronado in 2014.

 Geology 
 
The 
coal-bearing 
formation 
of 
interest 
at 
Logan 
is 
primarily 
the 
Kanawha 
Formation 
of 
Lower 
 Pennsylvanian 
System, 
which 
comprises 
a 
major 
portion 
of 
the 
exposed 
ridges. 
The 
Kanawha 
 Formation is 
a coal bearing 
sequence of sandstones, 
siltstones, shales, 
and mudstones with 
minor 
 occurrences of siderite, limestone and flint clay. 

 Coronado
 mines 
several 
horizons 
within 
the 
Kanawha 
formation. 
The 
horizons 
are 
as 
follows: 

 Buffalo Creek, Upper Clarion 
Rider, 
Clarion, Lower Clarion, Upper Stockton, Lower

and Lower 
War 
Eagle. 
Operations 
at the 
Logan 
Mine Complex 
extract 
multiple 
 coal seams by both underground and surface mining methods. 
 1.4
 Exploration Status 
 The Property has been extensively explored, largely by drilling with continuous coring methods and 
 rotary 
drilling, 
often 
supported 
by 
downhole 
geophysical 
methods. 
In 
addition 
to 
exploration 
 means, coal 
measurements from 
mine exposures 
have supplemented 
the database. 
The majority 
 of the data was acquired or 
generated by previous owners of the Property. 
These sources comprise 
 the primary 
data 
used in 
the evaluation 
of the 
coal 
resources 
and coal 
reserves 
on the 
Property. 

 MM A examined 
the data 
available for 
the evaluation 
and incorporated 
all pertinent 
information 
 into this TRS. 
Where data were anomalous or not 
representative, that data was not honored within 
 the digital databases and for subsequent processing by MM A. 

 Ongoing 
exploration 
has 
been 
carried 
out 
by 
Coronado 
since 
acquiring 
the 
Logan 
Complex. 
The 
 Coronado acquired exploration data 
has been consistent with past drilling activities. 
 1.5
 Operations and Development 
 As of December 31, 2022, underground mine operations were active at the Lower War Eagle, 
Eagle 
 No. 1 
and Muddy Bridge 
Mines with three, 
three or 
two active 
mining sections, respectively 
using 
 the 
room-and-pillar 
method. 
In 
addition, 
Coronado 
operates 
a 
single 
active 
underground 
room-
 and-pillar 
section 
in 
the 
North 
Fork 
Winifrede 
Mine. 
Annual 
deep 
mine 
production 
peaks 
at 
 approximately 
2.3 Mt 
in 2028. 
One active 
surface mine, 
Toney 
Fork, was 
also operating. 
Surface 
 production is 
projected to 
peak at 
0.6 Mt 
in 2028. 
Highwall miner 
production is 
also projected 
to 
 resume 
in 2023 
with a 
peak in 
2028 at 
0.44 Mt. 
Overall 
production will 
continue until 
2056 with 
 peak production occurring in 2028 at 3.3 Mt. 
 The Logan 
County Complex includes 
the Saunders 
Preparation Plant 
in addition to 
the mines. 
The 
 plant site includes raw coal storage, clean coal storage, a railroad loadout, and refuse disposal area. 

 The plant has a feed rate capacity 
of 1,088 raw tonnes per hour.

 Mineral Reserve 
 Reserve tonnage 
estimates provided 
herein report 
coal reserves 
derived from 
the in-situ resource 
 tons 
presented 
in 
 Table 
1-1
 , 
and 
not 
in 
addition 
to 
coal 
resources. 
Proven 
and 
probable 
coal 
 reserves 
were 
derived 
from 
the 
defined 
coal 
resource 
considering 
relevant 
mining, 
processing, 
 infrastructure, 
economic 
(including 
estimates 
of 
capital, 
revenue, 
and 
cost), 
marketing, 
legal, 
 environmental, 
socio-economic 
and regulatory 
factors. 
The 
Resource 
estimate 
has been 
used 
as 
 the basis 
for this Reserve 
calculation, which utilizes 
a reasonable Preliminary 
Feasibility Study, a Life-
 of Mine LOM) Mine Plan and practical recovery factors. 
Production modeling was completed with 
 an effective 
start 
date 
of October 
1, 2022. 
Additions and 
depletion have 
been used 
to 
bring the 
 Reserve estimate forward 
to December 31, 2022. 
 Factors 
that would 
typically preclude 
conversion 
of a 
coal resource 
to coal 
reserve, which 
include 
 the following: 
inferred resource 
classification; absence 
of coal quality; 
poor mine recovery; 
lack of 
 access; geological 
encumbrances 
associated 
with 
overlying 
and underlying 
strata; 
seam thinning; 
 structural 
complication; 
and 
insufficient 
exploration, 
have 
all 
been 
considered. 
Reserve 
 consideration 
excludes 
those 
portions 
of 
the 
resource 
area 
which 
exhibit 
the 
aforementioned 
 geological 
and 
operational 
encumbrances.

 Note: Marketable reserve tonnes are reported on a moist basis, including a combination of surface and inherent moisture. 
The combination of 
 surface and inherent moisture is modeled between 4.5 and 6-percent, depending upon mining method. 
Actual product moisture is 
 dependent upon multiple geological factors, operational factors, and product contract specifications and can exceed 8-percent. 
As such, the 
 modeled moisture values provide a level of conservatism for reserve reporting. 
 In summary, Coronado controls a total of 70.6 
Mt (moist basis) of 
marketable coal reserves at Logan 
 as of 
December 31, 
2022. 
Of that 
total, 75 
percent 
are proven, 
and 25 
percent 
are probable. 
All 
 70.6 
Mt 
are 
leased 
coal 
reserves 
and 
are 
assigned. 
Approximately 
61.6 
Mt 
of 
reserves 
are 
 considered suitable 
for the 
metallurgical coal 
market and 
9.0 Mt are 
projected to 
be sold into 
the 
 thermal coal market. 

 1.8
 Capital Summary 
 Coronado provided MM A with an inventory of operating equipment available 
at Logan. 
MM A s 
 capital schedules 
assume that 
major equipment 
rebuilds occur 
over the 
course of 
each machine s 
 remaining 
assumed 
operating 
life. 
Replacement 
equipment 
was 
scheduled 
based 
on 
MM A s 
 experience and knowledge 
of mining equipment and 
industry standards with 
respect to the 
useful 
 life of 
such equipment.

 Operating Costs 
 Coronado 
provided 
historical 
and 
preliminary 
5-year 
projections 
of 
operating 
costs 
for 
its 
active 
 mines 
for 
MM A s 
review. 
MM A 
used 
the 
historical 
and/or 
budget 
cost 
information 
as 
a 
 reference and 
developed personnel schedules for 
each mine. 
Hourly labor rates 
and salaries were 
 based upon 
information 
contained 
in Coronado s 
financial 
summaries. 
Fringe benefit 
costs 
were 
 developed 
for 
vacation 
and 
holidays, 
federal 
and 
state 
unemployment 
insurance, 
retirement, 
 workers compensation and pneumoconiosis, 
casualty and life insurance, healthcare and bonuses. 
 For 
the 
underground 
operations, 
a 
cost 
factor 
for 
mine 
supplies 
was 
developed 
that 
relates 
 expenditures 
to 
mine 
advance 
rates 
for 
roof 
control 
costs 
and 
other 
mine 
supply 
costs 
at 
 underground mines. 
Other factors were developed for maintenance and repair costs, rentals, mine 
 power, 
outside services and other direct mining costs. 

 Surface mine direct operating costs were developed 
as a function 
of overburden ratio for repair and 
 maintenance supplies, diesel fuel, explosives and blasting, and miscellaneous supplies 
and services. 
 Operating costs for highwall mines are based 
on costs per ROM tonne estimates. 
 Operating 
costs 
factors 
were 
also 
developed 
for 
the 
coal 
preparation 
plant 
processing, 
refuse 
 handling, coal loading, property taxes, and insurance and bonding.

 Economic Evaluation 
 The pre-feasibility financial 
model prepared for 
this TRS 
was developed to 
test the 
economic viability 
 of 
the 
coal 
resource 
area. 
The 
results 
of 
this 
financial 
model 
are 
not 
intended 
to 
represent 
a 
 bankable 
feasibility 
study, 
required 
for 
financing 
of 
any 
current 
or 
future 
mining 
operations 
 contemplated 
for the Coronado 
properties, but are 
intended to establish 
the economic viability 
of 
 the 
estimated 
coal 
reserves. 
Cash 
flows 
are 
simulated 
on 
an 
annual 
basis 
in 
nominal 
dollars 
 assuming a 2 inflation rate based 
on projected production from the coal 
reserves. 
The discounted 
 cash flow analysis presented herein is based on an effective 
date of January 1, 2023. 

 On an un-levered basis, the net 
present value NPV) of the project cash flow 
after taxes represents 
 the Enterprise 
Value of 
the project. 
The project cash 
flow, 
excluding debt 
service, is calculated 
by 
 subtracting direct 
and indirect 
operating expenses 
and capital 
expenditures from 
revenue. 
Direct 
 costs 
include 
labor, 
operating 
supplies, 
maintenance 
and 
repairs, 
facilities 
cost 
for 
materials 
 handling, 
coal 
preparation, 
refuse 
disposal,

 The Financial model includes 0.001 million tonnes of inferred coal production. 
Inferred coal represents 0.000001 of the total 
 production, and none of this coal was included in the estimate of reserves. 
 Consolidated cash flows are driven 
by annual sales 
tonnage, which at steady-state level ranges from 
 a peak of 3.3 million 
tonnes in 2028 to 
a low of 1.0 million tonnes 
in 2054. 
Projected consolidated 
 revenue ranges from 151.9 million to 480.3 million 
at a steady state. 
Revenue totals 11.4 billion 
 for the project s life. 
 Consolidated cash flow from operations is positive throughout the projected operating period, with 
 the 
exception 
of post 
-production 
years, 
due to 
end-of-mine 
reclamation 
spending. 
Consolidated 
 cash flow from operations 
peaks at 110.1 million in 
2038 and totals 2.5 billion over 
the project s 
 life. 
Capital 
expenditures 
total 
 190.2 
million 
from 
2023 
through 
2027 and 
 1.2 
billion 
over 
the 
 project s life. 

 1.10.1
 Discounted Cash Flow Analysis 
 Cash flow after 
tax, but before 
debt service, generated 
over the life 
of the project 
was discounted 
 to NPV 
at a 10.0 
discount rate, 
which represents 
Coronado s 
estimate of 
the nominal dollar, 
risk 
 adjusted 
weighted 
average 
cost 
of 
capital WACC) 
for 
likely 
market 
participants 
if 
the 
subject 
 reserves were offered for sale. 
On an un-levered basis, 
the NPV of 
the project cash 
flows represents 
 the 
Enterprise 
Value 
of 
the 
project 
and 
amounts 
to 
 366.6 
million. 
The 
pre-feasibility 
financial 
 model prepared for the 
TRS was developed to 
test the economic 
viability of 
each coal resource area. 

 The NPV estimate 
was made for 
the purpose of confirming 
the economics for 
classification of coal 
 reserves 
and 
not 
for 
purposes 
of 
valuing 
Coronado 
or 
its 
Logan 
assets. 
Mine 
plans 
were 
not 
 optimized, 
and 
actual 
results 
of 
the 
operations 
may 
be 
different, 
but 
in 
all 
cases, 
the 
mine 
 production plan assumes the properties are under competent management.

 Sensitivity Analysis 
 Sensitivity 
of the 
NPV 
results 
to 
changes 
in 
the 
key 
drivers 
is presented 
in the 
chart below. 
The 
 sensitivity study shows 
the NPV at 
the 10.0 discount 
rate when 
Base Case sales prices, operating 
 costs, and capital costs are increased and decreased in increments 
of 5 within a +/- 15 range. 
 Figure 1-4: 
Sensitivity of NPV 
 As shown, NPV is quite sensitive to changes in sales price and operating cost estimates, and slightly 
 sensitive to changes in capital cost estimates.

 Permitting 
 Coronado has obtained all mining and 
discharge permits to operate its active mines and 
processing, 
 loadout 
or 
related 
support 
facilities. 
MM A 
is 
unaware 
of 
any 
obvious 
or 
current 
Coronado 
 permitting issues that are expected to prevent the issuance of future permits. 
Logan, along with all 
 coal 
producers, 
is 
subject 
to 
a 
level 
of 
uncertainty 
regarding 
future 
clean 
water 
permits 
due 
to 
 United States Environmental Protection Agency
 EPA)
 
and 
 United States Fish and Wildlife USFW)
 involvement with state 
programs. 
 1.12
 Conclusion and Recommendations 
 Sufficient data 
has been obtained 
through various 
exploration and 
sampling programs 
and mining 
 operations 
to 
support 
the 
geological 
interpretations 
of 
seam 
structure 
and 
thickness 
for 
coal 
 horizons 
situated 
on 
the 
Logan 
Property. 
The 
data 
is 
of 
sufficient 
quantity 
and 
reliability 
to 
 reasonably support the coal resource and coal reserve estimates in this TRS.

which 
consider

 This geologic 
evaluation conducted 
in conjunction 
with the 
preliminary feasibility 
study concludes 
 that the 70.6 Mt of marketable 
coal reserves identified on the Property are 
economically mineable 
 under 
reasonable 
expectations 
of 
market 
prices 
for 
metallurgical 
coal 
products,

 Note: While the sources of data listed in Table 2-1 are not exhaustive, they represent a significant portion of information which supports this TRS. 

 MM A reviewed the provided data and found it to be reasonable prior to incorporating it into the TRS. 
The TRS contains forward-looking 
 information including forecasts of productivity and annual coal production, operating and capital cost estimates, coals sales price forecasts, the 
 assumption that Coronado will continue to acquire necessary permits, and other assumptions. 
The TRS statements and conclusions are not a 
 guarantee of future performance and undue reliance should not be placed on them. 
The ability of Coronado to recover the estimated coal reserves 
 is dependent on multiple factors beyond the control of MM A including, but not limited to geologic factors, mining conditions, regulatory 
 approvals, and changes in regulations. 
In all cases, the plans assume the Property is under competent management.
 Coronado engaged MM A to conduct a coal resource and reserve evaluation 
of the Coronado coal 
 properties as of 
September 30, 2022. 
Additions (Property and 
data) and depletion 
(mine) have been 
 used to bring 
the Resource and 
Reserve estimates forward to December 
31, 2022, the 
effective date 
 of this TRS for Logan. 
For the evaluation, the following tasks were to 
be completed:

> 
 Conduct site visits of the mines and mine infrastructure facilities; 

 > 
 Process the information supporting the estimation of coal resources 
and reserves into 
 geological models; 

 > 
 Develop life-of-reserve mine LOM) plans and financial models; 
 > 
 Hold discussions with Coronado company management; and 

 > 
 Prepare and issue a TRS providing a statement 
of coal resources and reserves which would 
 include: 
 -
 A description of the mines and facilities. 

 -
 A description of the evaluation process. 
 -
 An estimation of coal resources and reserves with compliance elements as stated 
under the 
 JORC Code and the SEC Regulation S-K 1300.

 Titles, Claims or Leases 
 The 
Property 
is 
composed 
of 
13,183 
total 
hectares, 
13,114 
of 
which 
are 
leased 
from 
private 
 landholders under approximately 15 individual 
leases, and 69 
hectares are owned by 
Coronado. The 
 latest 
Coronado 
lease 
of 
45 
hectares 
was 
obtained 
in 
2022. 
Subject 
to 
Coronado 
exercising 
its 
 renewal rights thereunder, a majority 
of the 
leases, covering a 
majority of 
the Logan 
reserves, expire 
 upon exhaustion of 
the relevant coal 
reserves, which is 
expected to occur 
in 2056. 
One lease 
expires 
 in 
2032; 
however, 
Coronado 
is 
projected 
to 
have 
previously 
exhausted 
the 
reserves 
covered 
 thereby. 
MM A has not carried out a separate title verification for the coal properties and has not 
 verified 
leases, 
deeds, 
surveys, 
or 
other 
property 
control 
instruments 
pertinent 
to 
the 
subject 
 resources. 
Property tenure 
was separately 
reviewed by 
Coronado s 
legal advisors. 
Coronado has 
 represented 
to MM A 
that it 
controls 
the mining 
rights to 
the reserves 
as shown 
on its 
property 
 maps, and MM A 
has accepted these 
as being a 
true and accurate 
depiction of the 
mineral rights 
 controlled 
by 
Coronado. 
The 
TRS 
assumes 
the 
properties 
are 
developed 
under 
responsible 
and 
 experienced management. 
 3.3
 Mineral Rights 
 Coronado supplied property control maps to MM A related to properties for which mineral and/or 
 surface 
property 
are 
controlled 
by 
Coronado. 
While 
MM A 
accepted 
these 
representations 
as 
 being 
true 
and 
accurate, 
MM A 
has 
no 
knowledge 
of 
past 
property 
boundary disputes 
or 
other 
 concerns, through 
past knowledge 
of the 
Property, 
that would 
signal concern 
over future 
mining 
 operations or development potential. 
 Property control 
in Appalachia 
can be 
intricate. 
Coal mining 
properties are 
typically composed 
of 
 numerous property 
tracts which 
are owned 
and/or leased 
from both 
land holding 
companies and 
 private 
individuals 
or 
companies. 
It 
is 
common 
to 
encounter 
severed 
ownership, 
with 
different 
 entities 
or individuals 
controlling 
the 
surface 
and mineral 
rights. 
Mineral 
control 
in the 
region 
is 
 typically characterized by leases or ownership of larger tracts of land, 
with surface control generally 
 comprised of smaller tracts, particularly in developed areas. 
 Legal mining rights 
may reflect 
a combination of in 
fee or mineral 
ownership and in 
fee or mineral 
 leases of coal lands 
through various surface and mineral lease 
agreements. 
There is also a 
relatively 
 small amount of area where the coal is partially-owned and/or partially leased on a limited number 
 of individual tracts. 

 Control 
of 
the 
surface 
property 
is 
necessary 
to 
conduct 
surface 
mining 
but 
is 
not 
necessary 
to 
 conduct underground mining.

 Upon acquisition of mineral 
control for 
desired coal seams 
of surface-mineable economic 
interest, 
 it 
is 
typical 
practice 
in 
the 
region 
for 
operators 
to 
delay 
the 
acquisition 
of 
surface 
control 
for 
 purposes 
of 
surface 
mining 
and 
other 
surface 
development 
until 
plans 
are 
established 
for 
near-
 future development. 
Therefore, it is common for an 
operator to control mineral for proposed areas 
 of 
mining 
for 
which 
they 
have 
not 
established 
the 
legal 
right 
to 
surface 
mine 
due 
to 
the 
lack 
of 
 surface 
control. 
Acquisition 
of 
these 
rights 
is 
typically 
delayed 
in 
order 
to 
limit 
cost 
and 
royalty 
 payments 
for 
areas not 
under consideration 
for 
near-future 
development. 
Coronado s 
executive 
 management 
team 
has 
a 
history 
of 
surface 
mining 
in 
Central 
Appalachia 
and 
has 
conveyed 
to 
 MM A that it has been successful in acquiring surface rights where needed for past operations. 
 3.4
 Encumbrances 
 No Title Encumbrances are known. 
By assignment, MM A did 
not complete a query 
related to Title 
 Encumbrances. 

 3.5
 Other Risks 
 There 
is 
always 
risk 
involved 
in 
property 
control. 
As 
is 
common 
practice, 
Coronado, 
and 
its 
 predecessors, have 
had their legal 
teams examine 
the deeds and title 
control in order 
to minimize 
 the risk. 
Historically, 
property control 
has not 
posed any 
significant challenges 
related 
to Logan s 
 operations.

 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 
 Infrastructure and Physiography 
 4.1
 Topography, 
Elevation, and Vegetation 
 Topography 
of the area 
surrounding the Logan County 
Complex is typical 
of the Central Appalachian 
 Plateau, 
being 
rugged 
and 
deeply 
dissected 
by 
v-shaped 
river 
valleys, 
and 
generally 
flanked 
by 
 steeply sided upland regions, 
with occasional gentle slopes in 
select areas. 
The drainage system 
in 
 the region tends to be mostly dendritic in nature. 
Surface elevations near the mine complex 
range 
 from approximately 
823 meters above 
sea level in upland regions 
to roughly 338 meters 
at stream 
 level. 
The Property 
is moderately 
to heavily 
vegetated, 
with oak-hickory 
forests 
as the 
dominant 
 forest type 
and northern hardwood forest 
being less prominent. 
The Property is not situated 
near 
 any major urban centers, and the surrounding area is rural. 
 4.2
 Access and Transport 
 Access to the Logan Mine property consists of primary, 
secondary, 
and unimproved roads, forming 
 a well-developed transportation network. 
Highway 119 is the primary highway in the area running 
 southwest 
to 
northeast 
from 
the 
Kentucky-West 
Virginia 
line 
through 
Mingo, 
Logan, 
and 
Boone 
 Counties. 
Secondary 
roads 
Route 
16 
and 
Route 
10 
provide 
the 
most 
direct 
access 
through 
the 
 Property

 roads provide direct access to the mine property, some being state- 
and county-maintained. 
These 
 roads typically stay 
open throughout the year. 
Additionally, 
private access roads 
to existing mines 
 provide 
transport 
corridors, 
and 
more 
such roads 
may 
be 
developed 
as 
needed. 
The 
Coronado-
 owned Saunders 
Preparation Plant 
services the mines. 
The ROM 
coal is delivered 
from the 
Lower 
 War Eagle Mine 
via overland conveyor, 
all remaining production is or will 
be delivered to the 
plant 
 site by truck. 

 4.3
 Proximity to Population Centers 

 The Logan property lies near the town of Lorado in Logan County, West Virginia, approximately 145 
 kilometers 
southeast 
of 
Huntington, 
West 
Virginia 
and 
129 
kilometers 
south-southwest 
of 
 Charleston, 
West 
Virginia. 
As 
of 
the 
2020 
census, 
Logan 
County 
had 
a 
population 
of 
32,567 
 residents, Boone County had 21,809 residents, and Wyoming 
County had 21,382 residents. 

 4.4
 Climate and Length of Operating Season 
 The region s climate 
is classified as humid, sub-tropical with four distinct seasons: 
warm summers, 
 cold winters, 
and moderate 
fall and 
spring seasons. 
Precipitation in 
the region 
occurs throughout 
 the year with 
the most rain falling 
in spring and 
the early months 
of summer. 
Average yearly rainfall 
 is 67.69 centimeters. 
Summer months typically begin 
in late May 
and end in early 
September and 
 range in 
average 
temperature from 
53 to 84 
degrees Fahrenheit 
(or 11.6 to 
28.9 degrees 
Celsius). 

 Winters 
typically 
begin 
in 
mid 
to 
late 
November 
and 
run 
until 
mid 
to 
late 
March 
with 
average 
 temperatures 
ranging 
from 
26 
to 
57 
degrees 
Fahrenheit 
(or 
-3.3 
to 
13.9 
degrees 
Celsius). 

 Precipitation 
in the 
winter 
typically 
comes 
in the 
form 
of snowfall 
or 
as a 
wintery 
mix (sleet 
and 
 snow) with 
severe 
snowfall events 
occurring occasionally. 
Seasonal variations 
in climate 
typically 
 do 
not 
affect 
underground 
mining 
in 
West 
Virginia. 
However, 
weather 
events 
could 
potentially 
 incumber surface mining 
and preparation 
plant operations 
on a very limited 
basis, typically lasting 
 less than a few days. 
 4.5
 Infrastructure 
 The Logan Mine Complex has sources of water, 
power, 
personnel, and supplies readily available for 
 use. 
Personnel have historically been sourced from 
the surrounding communities in Logan, Boone, 
 Wyoming, 
and Mingo 
counties, and 
have 
proven 
to be 
adequate in 
numbers 
to operate 
past and 
 current mines. 
As mining is 
common in 
the surrounding 
areas, the 
workforce 
is generally 
familiar 
 with 
mining 
practices 
and 
is 
comprised 
of 
a 
strong 
talent 
pool 
of 
experienced 
miners. 
Water 
is 
 sourced locally 
from Buffalo 
Creek Public 
Service District and 
electricity is sourced 
from 
 American 
 Electric 
Power AEP)
 . 
The 
service 
industry 
in 
the 
areas 
surrounding 
the 
mine 
complex 
has 
 historically 
provided 
supplies, 
equipment 
repairs 
and 
fabrication, 
etc. 
The 
Coronado-owned 
 Saunders Preparation 
plant services 
the mines 
and operates 
at a 
rate 
of 952 
tph. 
The Coronado-
 owned Elk Lick Loadout serves 
as the primary means 
of shipment and is 
connected to a CSX rail line, 
 which either serves the domestic market directly, or transports the coal to the Pier 9 and Dominion 
 terminals at Norfolk, Virginia for overseas 
shipment.

 History 
 5.1
 Previous Operation 
 The Logan County 
properties were started in 
1945 by 
 Lorado Mining Company
 , were sold 
to 
 Buffalo 
 Mining Company
 
in 1964 and then to 
 Pittston Coal Company Pittston)
 
in 1971. 
Pittston operated 
 the properties until the early 1990 s. 
After being idle for a period, the properties were then sold to 
 Addington 
Resources
 
in 
2004. 

 Imagin 
Natural 
Resources
 
acquired 
the 
properties 
in 
2007, 
and 
 subsequently sold them to Cliffs in 2011, which in turn sold the properties to Coronado in 2014. 
 Coronado produced approximately 
1.8 Mt in 2016, 
2.6 Mt in 2017, 2.6 
Mt in 2018, 2.7 Mt 
in 2019, 
 1.6 Mt in 2020, 1.9 Mt in 2021, and 2.1 Mt in 2022. 
 5.2
 Previous Exploration 
 The 
Properties 
have 
been 
extensively 
explored 
by 
subsurface 
drilling 
efforts 
carried 
out 
by 
 numerous entities, most of which were completed prior to acquisition by Coronado. 
 Drill records 
indicate that 
independent contract 
drilling operators 
have 
typically been 
engaged 
to 
 carry out drilling on the Properties. 
Geophysical logging was typically performed by outside logging 
 firms. 
MM A, via 
its Geophysical 
Logging Systems 
subsidiary, 
has logged 
a significant 
number of 
 the past exploration holes and gas wells, and currently 
logs most of the recently drilled holes.

 Coal deposits in 
the eastern USA are 
the oldest and most 
extensively developed 
in the country. 
The 
 coal 
deposits 
on 
the 
Properties 
are 
Carboniferous 
in 
age, 
being 
of 
the 
Pennsylvanian 
system. 

 Overall, 
these 
Carboniferous 
coals 
contain 
two-fifths 
of 
the 
USA s 
bituminous 
coal 
deposits 
and 
 extend over 1,448 kilometers 
from northern Alabama 
to Pennsylvania and are 
part of 
what is known 
 as the 
 Appalachian Basin
 . 
The Appalachian 
Basin is 
more than 
402 kilometers 
wide and, 
in some 
 portions, contains over 60 coal seams of varying economic significance. 
 Within the Central 
Appalachian Basin, seams 
of economic significance 
typically range 
between 0.3 
 meters and 1.8 meters in thickness, with relatively little structural deformation. 
Regional structure 
 is typically characterized by gently dipping strata 
to the northwest at less than one percent. 
 The coal-bearing formations of interest at Logan 
is of the 
lower section of - 
the Kanawha Formation, 
 which 
comprise 
a 
major 
portion 
of 
the 
exposed 
ridges. 
The 
coal-bearing 
Formation 
includes 
 sedimentary sequences of sandstones, siltstones, shales, 
and mudstones with minor 
occurrences of 
 siderite, limestone and flint clay. 
 Coronado
 mines 
several 
horizons 
within 
the 
Kanawha 
formation.

the 
three 
primary 
types 
of

by hole 
due to 
the hilly 
terrain 
of the

process. 
A 
total 
of

been 
drilled 
for 
exploration 
 purposes on and around the leased property.

 The 
concentration 
of 
exploration 
varies 
slightly 
across

are needed. 
Even so, 
 most of the drill 
hole data comes from more simplified 
driller s logs, which often lack 
specific details 
 regarding 
geotechnical 
conditions 
and 
specific 
geology, 
making 
correlations 
and 
floor 
and 
roof 
 conditions 
more 
difficult 
to 
determine. 
Geophysical 
logging 
(e-logging) 
techniques, 
by 
contrast, 
 document 
specific 
details 
useful 
for 
geologic 
interpretation 
and 
mining 
conditions. 
Given 
the 
 variability 
of data 
-gathering 
methods, 
 definitive
 
mapping of 
future 
mining conditions 
may 
not be 
 possible, but projections and assumptions can be 
made within a 
 reasonable
 
degree of certainty. 
A 
 significant 
effort 
was put 
into 
verifying the 
integrity of 
the database 
records. 
Once the 
data 
was 
 verified, stratigraphic 
columnar sections were 
generated using 
cross-sectional analysis to 
establish 
 or confirm coal seam correlations. 
 A typical cross-section is shown in

 Therefore, discretion by MM A

of

 Non-Drilling Procedures and Parameters 
 Some analyses, specifically 
ultimate ash and 
sulfur types are 
not as prevalent as 
others in the 
testing 
 done 
on 
samples 
recovered 
by 
drilling. 
To 
supplement 
the 
information 
database, 
samples 
have 
 been collected from mine stockpiles and either truck or train shipment samples. 
 7.3
 Drilling Procedures 
 Core drilling methods utilize NX-size (5.4 centimeters) or similar-sized core cylinders to 
recover core 
 samples, which 
can be 
used to 
delineate 
geologic characteristics, 
and for 
coal quality 
testing 
and 
 geotechnical logging. 
For the core 
holes, the geophysical 
logs are especially 
useful in verifying 
the 
 core recovery of both 
the coal samples 
(for assurance that sample 
is representative of the full 
seam) 
 and 
of 
the 
roof 
and 
floor 
rock 
samples 
(for 
evaluating 
ground 
control 
characteristics 
of 
deep 
 mineable coal 
seams). 
In addition 
to the 
core holes, 
rotary drilled 
holes also 
exist on 
most of 
the 
 Properties. 
Data 
for 
the 
rotary 
drilled 
holes 
is 
mainly 
derived 
from 
downhole 
geophysical 
logs, 
 which are 
used to 
interpret 
coal and 
rock thickness 
and depth 
since logging 
of the 
drill cuttings 
is 
 not reliable. 
 A wide variety 
of core-logging techniques 
exist for 
the properties. 
For many of 
the core holes, the 
 primary data 
source is a 
generalized 
lithology description by 
the driller, 
typically supplemented 
by 
 a more detailed core log completed by a geologist. 
The Logan drilling logs were provided to MM A 
 as 
a geological 
database. 
MM A geologists 
were 
not involved 
in the 
production 
of original 
core 
 logs but did perform 
a basic check 
of information within the provided database. 
Where geophysical 
 logs for 
such holes 
are available, 
they were 
used by 
MM A geologists 
to verify 
the coal 
thickness 
 and core recovery of each seam.

 Hydrology 
 Hydrologic 
testing 
and 
forecasting 
are 
necessary parts 
of the 
permitting 
process 
and 
as 
such 
are 
 routinely considered in the mine planning process. 
 Logan 
has 
a 
lengthy 
history 
of 
operation 
and 
five 
currently 
active 
mines 
with 
no 
significant 
 hydrologic concerns or 
material issues 
experienced in its 
history. 
Future mining 
is projected to 
occur 
 in areas exhibiting similar hydrogeological conditions as past mining, including stream undermining 
 and undermining 
of aquifers. 
Based upon 
the successful 
history of 
the operation 
with regards 
to 
 hydrogeological features, 
MM A assumes that the operation will not be hindered by such issues in 
 the future.

 Geotechnical Data 
 Mining 
plans 
for 
potential 
underground

were

that 
was

by 
the 
 National 
Institute 
for

 . 
MM A reviewed the results from the ACPS analysis and 
 considered it 
in the 
development of 
the LOM 
plan. 
Coal and 
rock strengths 
from core 
testing are 
 used to verify the empirical assumptions integral to ACPS.

 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 
 8.1
 Prior to Sending to the Lab 
 Most 
of the 
coal 
samples have 
been obtained 
from 
the Property 
by subsurface 
exploration 
using 
 core drilling 
techniques. 
The protocol 
for preparing 
and testing 
the samples 
has varied 
over time 
 and is not well documented for the older holes drilled on the Property. 
Following a process, typical 
 USA 
core 
drilling 
sampling 
technique 
is 
for 
the 
coal 
core 
sample, 
once 
recovered 
from 
the 
core 
 barrel, to be described then wrapped in a sealed plastic sleeve 
and placed into a wooden core box, 
 which 
is 
the 
length 
of 
the 
sample 
and 
covered 
with 
a 
lid 
so 
that 
the 
core 
can 
be 
delivered 
to 
a 
 laboratory in relatively intact 
condition and with inherent moisture content. 
Each core sample box 
 is identified with the 
seam, hole identification number and 
the sample interval depth scribed 
on the 
 sample box lid. 
This process 
has been 
the norm 
for both historical and 
ongoing exploration activities 
 at Logan. 
 This work is 
typically performed by 
the supervising 
driller, geologist or company personnel. 
Samples 
 are 
most 
often 
delivered 
to 
the 
company 
by 
the 
driller 
after 
each 
shift 
or 
acquired 
by 
company 
 personnel or representatives. 
Most of the coal core samples were obtained 
by previous or current 
 operators 
on the Property. 
MM A did not participate 
in the sample 
collection and analysis of 
the 
 core samples. 
However, 
it is 
reasonable to 
assume, given 
the sophistication 
level of 
the previous 
 operators, 
that 
these 
samples 
were 
generally 
collected 
and 
processed 
under 
industry

 companies used to perform the analysis. 
 8.2
 Lab Procedures 
 Coal quality testing has 
been performed over a large number 
of years by operating companies using 
 different 
laboratories 
and 
testing 
regimens. 
Some 
of 
the 
samples 
have 
raw 
analyses 
and 
 washabilities of 
the full seam 
(with coal 
and rock parting 
layers 
co-mingled) and 
are mainly 
useful 
 for 
characterizing 
the coal 
quality for 
projected 
production 
from 
underground 
and highwall 
mine 
 operations. 
Other 
samples 
have 
coal 
and 
rock 
analyzed 
separately, 
the 
results 
of 
which 
can 
be 
 manipulated 
to forecast 
either surface 
or underground 
mine quality. 
Care has 
been taken 
to use 
 only 
those 
analyses 
that 
are 
representative 
of 
the 
coal 
quality 
parameters 
for 
the 
appropriate 
 mining type for each sample. 
 Standard procedure 
upon receipt of 
core samples by the 
testing laboratory 
is to log the 
depth and 
 thickness 
of 
the 
sample, 
then 
perform 
testing 
as 
specified 
by 
a 
representative 
of 
the 
operating 
 company.

 Data Verification 
 9.1
 Procedures of Qualified Person 
 MM A reviewed the digital geologic 
database supplied by Coronado. 
The database consists of 
data 
 records, which 
include drill hole 
information for 
holes that 
lie within and 
adjacent to 
the Property 
 and 
records 
for 
numerous 
supplemental 
coal 
seam 
thickness 
measurements. 
For 
supplemental 
 record 
verification, 
copies 
of 
each 
entry 
were 
printed, 
and 
cross 
referenced 
to 
the 
original 
 document for 
verification. 
Once the initial 
integrity of the 
database was 
established, stratigraphic 
 columnar sections were 
generated 
using cross-sectional analysis 
to establish 
or confirm coal 
seam 
 correlations. 
Geophysical 
logs 
were 
used 
wherever 
available 
to 
assist 
in 
confirming 
the 
seam 
 correlation 
and 
to 
verify 
proper 
seam 
thickness 
measurements 
and 
recovery 
of 
intercepted 
coal 
 sections and collected samples. 

 After establishing and/or verifying proper seam correlation, seam data control maps and geological 
 cross-sections were generated 
and again used to verify seam correlations and data 
integrity. 
Once 
 the database was fully vetted, seam thickness, base of seam elevation, roof and floor lithology, and 
 overburden maps were independently generated 
for use in the mine planning process.

 Limitations 
 As 
with 
any 
exploration 
program, 
localized 
anomalies 
cannot 
always 
be 
discovered. 
Ideally, 
the 
 greater 
the density 
of the 
samples taken, 
the less 
the risk. 
Once an 
area is 
identified as 
being of 
 interest for inclusion in the mine plan, additional samples are taken to help reduce the risk in those 
 specific areas. 
In general, provision 
is made in the 
mine planning portion of 
the study to 
allow for 
 localized anomalies that are typically classed more as a nuisance than a hinderance. 
 9.3
 Opinion of Qualified Person 
 Sufficient data 
has been obtained 
through various 
exploration and 
sampling programs 
and mining 
 operations 
to 
support 
the 
geological 
interpretations 
of 
seam 
structure 
and 
thickness 
for 
coal 
 horizons 
situated 
on the 
Property. 
The data 
is of 
sufficient 
quantity 
and reliability 
to 
reasonably 
 support the coal resource and coal reserve estimates in this TRS.

 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
 10.1
 Testing 
Procedures 
 Separate 
tabulations 
have 
been 
compiled 
for 
basic 
chemical 
analyses 
(both 
raw 
and 
washed 
 quality), petrographic 
data, rheological 
data and 
chlorine, ash, 
ultimate and 
sulfur analysis. 
Some 
 of 
the 
data 
categories 
from 
the 
analyses 
are 
not 
as 
prevalent 
and 
have 
been 
supplemented 
by 
 samples collected from mine stockpiles and either truck or train shipment samples. 
 Available coal quality data was tabulated by resource area in a Microsoft EXCEL workbook and the 
 details of that work are maintained on file at 
the offices of Coronado and MM A. 
These tables also 
 provide basic 
statistical 
analyses of 
the coal 
quality attributes, 
including average 
value; maximum 
 and minimum values; 
and the sample 
count (number of 
samples) available to 
represent each quality 
 parameter 
of 
the 
seam. 
Coal 
samples 
that 
were 
deemed 
by 
MM A 
geologists 
to 
be 
 unrepresentative 
were 
not 
used 
for 
statistical 
analysis 
of 
coal 
quality, 
as 
documented 
in 
the 
 tabulations. 
A representative 
group of 
drill hole 
samples from 
the Properties 
were 
then checked 
 against the original drill laboratory reports to verify accuracy 
and correctness. 
 The amount and areal extent of coal sampling 
for geological data is generally sufficient to represent 
 the quality characteristics of 
the coal horizons 
and allow for 
proper market placement of 
the subject 
 coal 
seams. 
For 
some 
of 
the 
coal 
deposits, 
there 
are 
considerable 
laboratory 
data 
from 
core 
 samples 
that 
are 
representative 
of 
the 
full 
extent 
of 
the 
resource 
area; 
and 
for 
others 
there 
are 
 more 
limited 
data 
to 
represent 
the 
resource 
area. 
For 
example, 
in 
the 
active 
operations 
with 
 considerable 
previous 
mining, 
there 
may 
be 
limited 
quality 
data 
within 
some 
of 
the 
remaining 
 resource 
areas; 
however, 
in 
those 
cases 
the 
core 
sampling 
data 
can 
be 
supplemented 
with 
 operational data from mining and shipped quality samples representative 
of the resource area.

 Relationship of Tests 
to the Whole 
 The extensive 
sampling and 
testing procedures 
typically followed 
in the 
coal 
industry result 
in an 
 excellent correlation between samples and marketable 
product. 
Shipped analyses of the coal from 
 Logan were reviewed to verify 
that the coal 
quality and characteristics were as 
expected. 
The Logan 
 properties 
have 
a 
long 
history 
of 
saleable 
production, 
under

owners, 
in

 Mineral Resource Estimates 
 MM A 
independently 
created 
a 
geologic 
model 
to 
define 
the 
coal 
resources 
of 
Logan. 
Coal 
 resources were estimated 
as of December 31, 2022. 
 11.1
 Assumptions, Parameters and Methodology 
 Geological 
data 
was 
imported 
into 
Carlson 
Mining

(formerly 
SurvCADD 
geological 
modelling 
 software 
in 
the 
form 
of Microsoft

Excel 
files 
incorporating 
drill 
hole 
collars, 
seam 
and 
thickness 
 picks, bottom 
seam elevations 
and raw 
and washed 
coal quality. 
These data 
files were 
validated 
 prior to importing into the software. 
Once imported, a geologic model was created, reviewed, and 
 verified with 
a key 
element being 
a gridded model 
of coal 
seam thickness. 
Resource tonnes 
were 
 estimated by using the 
seam thickness grid 
based on each 
valid point of observation 
and by defining 
 resource confidence arcs around the 
points of observation. 
Points of observation for Measured and 
 Indicated 
confidence 
arcs 
were 
defined 
for 
all 
valid 
drill 
holes 
that 
intersected 
the 
seam 
using 
 standards 
deemed acceptable 
by MM A 
based on 
a detailed 
geologic evaluation 
and a 
statistical 
 analysis 
of 
all 
drill 
holes 
within 
the 
projected 
reserve 
areas 
as 
described 
in 
 Section 
11.1.1
 . 
The 
 geological 
evaluation 
incorporated 
an 
analysis 
of 
seam 
thickness 
related 
to 
depositional 
 environments, adjacent roof and floor lithologies, and structural influences. 
 After validating coal seam data and establishing correlations, the thickness and elevation for seams 
 of 
economic 
interest 
were 
used 
to 
generate 
a 
geologic 
model. 
Due 
to 
the 
relative 
structural 
 simplicity 
of 
the 
deposits 
and 
the 
reasonable 
continuity 
of 
the 
tabular 
coal 
beds, 
the 
principal 
 geological 
interpretation 
necessary 
to 
define 
the 
geometry 
of 
the 
coal 
deposits 
is 
the 
proper 
 modeling 
of 
their 
thickness 
and 
elevation.

 11.1.1
 Geostatistical Analysis 
 MM A completed a 
geostatistical analysis on drill 
holes within 
the reserve boundaries 
to determine 
 the applicability of the common United States classification system for measured and indicated and 
 inferred coal 
resources. 
Historically, 
the United States 
has assumed that coal 
within 0.4-kilometer 
 of a point of observation represents a measured resource whereas coal between 0.4 kilometer 
and 
 1.2 kilometer from 
a point 
of observation 
is classified 
as indicated. 
Inferred resources are commonly 
 assumed to be located between 1.2 kilometers and 4.8 kilometers from a point of observation. 
Per 
 SEC 
regulations, 
only 
measured 
and 
indicated 
resources 
may 
be 
considered 
for 
reserve 
 classification, respectively as proven and probable reserves. 
 MM A performed 
a geostatistical 
analysis test 
of the 
Logan data 
set using 
the Drill 
Hole Spacing 
 Analysis DHSA) 
method. 
This 
method 
attempts 
to 
quantify 
the 
uncertainty 
of 
applying 
a 
 measurement 
from 
a 
central 
location 
to 
increasingly 
larger 
square 
blocks 
and 
provides 
 recommendations 
for determining 
the distances 
between drill 
holes for 
measured, indicated, 
and 
 inferred resources. 
 To 
perform DHSA the data 
set was processed to remove 
any erroneous data points, 
clustered data 
 points, as 
well as 
directional trends. 
This was 
achieved through 
the use 
of histograms, 
as seen 
in 
 Figure 11-1
 , color coded scatter 
plots showing the geospatial positioning 
of the borings, 
 Figure 11-
 2
 , and trend analysis.

 Following the completion of 
data processing, a variogram 
of the data set was 
created, 
 Figure 11-3
 . 

 The 
variogram 
plots average 
square difference 
against 
the separation 
distance 
between 
the data 
 pairs. 
The 
separation 
distance 
is broken 
up into 
separate 
bins defined 
by a 
uniform 
lag distance 
 (e.g., for 
a lag 
distance of 
152 meters 
the bins 
would be 
0 
152 meters, 
153 
305 meters, 
etc.). 

 Each pair of data points that are less than one lag distance apart are reported in the first bin. 
If the 
 data 
pair 
is 
further 
apart 
than 
one 
lag 
distance 
but 
less 
than 
two 
lag 
distances 
apart, 
then 
the 
 variance is reported in the second bin. 
The numerical average for differences 
reported for each bin 
 is then plotted on the variogram. 
Care was taken to 
define the lag distance in such a way 
as to not 
 overestimate any nugget effect 
present in the data set. 
Lastly, modeled equations, often spherical, 
 gaussian, or 
exponential, are 
applied to 
the variogram 
in order 
to represent 
the data 
set across 
a 
 continuous spectrum.

 The estimation 
variance is 
then calculated 
using information 
from the 
modeled variogram 
as well 
 as 
charts 
published 
by 
Journel 
and 
Huijbregts 
(1978). 
This 
value 
estimates 
the 
variance 
from 
 applying 
a 
single 
central 
measurement 
to 
increasingly 
larger 
square 
blocks. 
Care 
was 
taken 
to 
 ensure any nugget effect present was added back 
into the data. 
This process was repeated for each 
 test block size. 
 The final step of the process 
is to calculate the 
global estimation variance. 
In this step the number 
 square 
blocks that 
would fit 
inside the 
selected study 
area is 
determined for 
each block 
size 
that 
 was 
investigated 
in the 
previous 
step. 
The estimation 
variance 
is then 
divided by 
the number 
of 
 blocks that 
would fit 
inside the 
study area 
for 
each test 
block size. 
Following this 
determination, 
 the data is then transformed back to represent 
the relative error in the 95
 th
 -percentile range.

 shows 
the results 
of the 
DHSA 
performed 
on the 
No. 2 
Gas seam 
data 
for 
the 
Logan 
 Complex. 
DHSA provides hole 
to hole 
spacing values, 
these distances need 
to be converted to 
radius 
 from a central point in order to 
compare to the historical standards. 
A summary of the radius data 
 is shown 
in 
 Table 
11-3
 . 
DHSA prescribes 
measured, indicated, 
and inferred 
drill hole 
spacings be 
 determined at the 10-percent, 20-percent, and 50-percent 
levels of relative error, 
respectively.

are 
more 
conservative 
than 
even 
the 
most 
conservative 
DHSA 
model 
with 
regards 
to 
 determining measured resources. 
The Exponential and 
Spherical models recommend using 
a radius 
 of 0.87 kilometers for measured resources compared to the historical value of 0.4 kilometers. 
With 
 respect to indicated resources, 
the Spherical and Exponential models recommend using a 
radius of 
 1.53 kilometers. 
The historical radius of 1.2 kilometers is 
therefore also more conservative than the 
 DHSA results 
for indicated 
resources. 
These results 
have led 
the QPs 
to report 
the data 
following 
 the historical classification standards, rather 
than use the results of the DHSA.

Coal resources are reported on a dry basis. 
Surface moisture and inherent moisture are excluded. 
 Note 3: The Property has 82.2 Mt of dry, in-place measured and indicated resource tonnes exclusive of reserves as of December 31, 2022. 
 11.3
 Resources Exclusive of Reserves 
 The Property contains multiple resource blocks which 
were not deemed to 
exhibit reserve potential 
 at the time 
of the study. 
These underground-mineable resources, 
formally identified 
as resources 
 exclusive of 
reserves, are from 
the No. 2 Gas, 
Lower Powellton, Peerless, 
Lower Winifrede, Middle 
 Cedar 
Grove 
and 
Beckley 
coal 
seams. 
There 
are 
also 
surface 
mineable 
resources 
exclusive 
of 
 reserves in various seams. Reasons 
which may preclude elevation 
of resources to reserves 
include, 
 but are not limited to: 
 1.
 Unfavorable economics 
at the PFS level, yet economics could become attractive 
in the future 
 under different market 
conditions. 

 2.
 Exclusion from LOM planning by mining operator 
due to remaining resource blocks which are 
 relatively small, isolated blocks and not currently attractive 
from an operational perspective. 

 11.3.1
 Initial Economic Assessment 
 MM A completed an initial economic assessment to 
determine the potential economic viability of 
 resources exclusive of reserves. 
Unlike the economic analysis presented in 
 Section
 
19 developed to 
 test 
reserves, 
the initial 
economic 
assessment 
below is 
presented 
on a 
real basis 
in 2023 
dollars. 

 MM A 
applied 
relevant 
technical 
factors 
to 
estimate 
potential 
saleable 
tonnes 
without 
the 
 resource blocks, should the resources be extracted via 
deep, continuous mining methods or 
surface 
 area methods. 
MM A developed 
cash cost 
profiles for 
the resource 
blocks, including 
direct cash 
 costs (labor, 
supplies, roof control, 
maintenance and 
repair, 
power, 
and other); washing, 
trucking, 
 materials 
handling, 
general 
and 
administrative, 
and 
environmental 
costs; 
and 
indirect 
cash 
costs 
 (royalties, production taxes, property tax, insurance). 
Costs were developed based off 
relevant cost 
 drivers 
(per-meter, 
per-bank 
cubic meter, 
per-raw-tonne, 
per-clean-tonne). 
Additionally, 
MM A 
 estimated capital costs to extract 
resources. 
Capital costs associated with mine development were 
 amortized 
across 
the 
resource s 
potential 
saleable 
tonnages. 
Additional 
non-cash 
items 
 (depreciation of equipment and depletion) and cash costs were compared to an assumed sale price 
 of 154 per tonne 
(FOB loadout) for underground 
-mineable resources, representing 
the long-term 
 average 
price forecast 
for HVB provided 
by Coronado. 
Surface resources 
were assessed 
at a 
sales 
 price of 
 83 per tonne 
(FOB loadout) 
based on estimated 
historical pricing 
for Coronado s 
surface 
 operations. 
The results of the analysis are shown below and demonstrate potential profitability on 
 a fully loaded cost basis.

 Qualified Person s Opinion 
 While 
there 
is 
some 
level 
of 
stratigraphically 
controlled 
seam-thickness 
variability 
due 
to 
seam 
 splitting, 
sand channels, 
etc., 
the coal 
seams on 
the mine 
property 
in Logan 
County demonstrate 
 reasonable 
thickness 
consistency 
according 
to 
the 
classification 
system 
of 
 measured
 
(0 
 
0.4 
 kilometer), 
 indicated
 
(0.4 to 1.2 
kilometers), and 
 inferred
 
(1.2 to 4.8 kilometers). 
MM A geologists 
 and engineers 
modeled the deposit 
and delineated mineable 
regions to 
reflect the 
nature of 
each 
 seam and the practicality of mining constraints. 
Based on MM A s 
geostatistical analysis, it would 
 be 
possible 
to 
extend 
the 
measured, 
indicated 
and 
inferred 
arcs 
slightly 
beyond 
historically 
 accepted practices due to consistent geological settings. 
The QP s have again elected not to extend 
 arc distances, introducing a level of conservatism in measured 
and indicated coal classification. 
 Based on the data 
review, 
the attendant work 
done to verify the data 
integrity and the creation 
of 
 an independent 
geologic model, 
the QPs 
believe
 
this is 
a fair 
and accurate 
representation 
of the 
 Logan coal resources.

 Assumptions, Parameters and Methodology 
 Coal Reserves are classified as 
 proven
 
or 
 probable
 
considering modifying factors including mining, 
 metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, 
environmental, social and governmental 
factors. 
 > 
 Proven Coal Reserves
 
are the economically mineable part of a measured coal resource, 
 adjusted for diluting materials and allowances for losses when the material is mined. 
It is based 
 on appropriate assessment and studies in consideration of and adjusted 
for reasonably 
 assumed modifying factors. 
These assessments demonstrate that extraction 
could be 
 reasonably justified at the time of reporting.

 Upon completion of delineation 
and calculation of coal 
resources, MM A generated a LOM plan 
for 
 Logan. 
The footprint of each reserve area is shown on the maps in

from 
LOM 
plan 
sequencing 
were 
processed 
into 
Microsoft
 
 EXCEL spreadsheets 
and summarized 
on an 
annual basis 
for processing 
into the 
economic model. 

 Average seam densities were 
estimated to determine raw 
coal tonnes produced 
from the LOM 
plan. 

 Average mine recovery 
and wash recovery factors 
were applied to determine coal reserve tonnes. 

 Coal 
reserve 
tonnes 
in this 
evaluation 
are 
reported 
at 
a 
4.5 percent 
to 6.0 
percent 
moisture 
and 
 represent the saleable product from the Property. 

 Pricing 
data 
as 
provided 
by 
Coronado 
is 
described 
in 
 Section 
16.2
 . 
The 
pricing 
data 
assumes 
 respective HVA, HVB, specialty markets 
and thermal FOB-mine prices of approximately 192, 170, 
 and 
 227 
per 
metric 
tonne 
for 
calendar 
year 
2023. 
HVA, 
HVB, 
and 
thermal 
prices 
respectively 
 decrease 
to 
approximately 
 151, 
 132, 
and 
 83 
per 
metric 
tonne 
through 
year 
2027, 
and 
then 
 increase to 271, 237, and 150 per metric tonne through year 2056. 
 The coal resource mapping and estimation 
process, described in this report was used 
as a basis for 
 the coal reserve 
estimate. 
Proven and 
probable coal 
reserves were 
derived from 
the defined coal 
 resource 
considering 
relevant 
processing, 
economic 
(including 
technical 
estimates 
of 
capital, 
 revenue, and cost), marketing, 
legal, environmental, socio-economic, and 
regulatory factors and are 
 presented on a moist, recoverable 
basis. 
 As is 
customary in 
the US, 
the categories 
for proven 
and probable 
coal reserves 
are based 
on the 
 distances 
from 
valid 
points 
of 
measurement 
as 
determined 
by 
the 
QPs 
for 
the 
area 
under 
 consideration. 
For this 
evaluation, measured 
resource, which 
may convert 
to a 
proven reserve, 
is 
 based on a 0.4-kilometer radius from a valid point of observation. 
 Points of observation include exploration drill holes, gas wells, and 
mine measurements which have 
 been 
fully 
vetted 
and 
processed 
into 
a 
geologic 
model. 
The 
geologic 
model 
is 
based 
on 
seam 
 depositional modeling, the 
interrelationship of overlying and 
underlying strata on seam mineability, 
 seam thickness trends, 
the impact of seam 
structure (i.e., faulting), 
intra-seam characteristics, 
etc. 

 Once 
the 
geologic 
model 
was 
completed, 
a 
statistical 
analysis, 
described 
in 
 Section 
11.1.1
 
was 
 conducted 
and 
a 
0.4-kilometer 
radius 
from 
a 
valid 
point 
of 
observation 
was 
selected 
to 
define 
 Measured Resources. 

 Likewise, 
the distance 
between 0.4 
and 1.2 of 
a kilometer 
radius was 
selected to 
define Indicated 
 Resources. 
Indicated Resources may convert 
to Probable Reserves. 

 Inferred Resources (greater than a 
1.2-kilometer radius from a 
valid point of 
observation) have been 
 excluded from Reserve consideration.

 Mineral Reserves 
 Logan reserves were derived from multiple coal seams located on the 
Property and shown in 
 Figure 
 7.1
 . 
Reserves 
are 
estimated 
for 
both 
surface 
and 
underground

 12.2.1
 Surface Reserves 
 Surface coal reserves of the Property include an estimated 32.5 Mt. 
Each surface mine area -- Tony 
 Fork, Buffalo 
Creek South 
and Sugar 
Camp -- 
includes coal 
reserves from 
multiple seams. 
Two 
of 
 the three 
surface reserve 
areas, Toney 
Fork and 
Buffalo 
Creek South, 
include both 
permitted 
and 
 non-permitted 
tonnages, 
where 
Sugar 
Camp 
tonnage 
is 
not 
permitted. 
The 
Property 
has 
five 
 surface 
mine permits 
for 
contour 
and highwall 
mining. 
Even 
so, in 
2022 there 
was minor 
surface 
 mine activity on just two of the five surface mine permits at Toney 
Fork Mine No. 3 and Elk Lick. 

 12.2.1.1
 Toney 
Fork Surface 
 Toney 
Fork 
surface 
area 
is located 
north 
of Buffalo 
Creek 
on 
the north 
side of 
the 
Property. 
The 
 Toney 
Fork drainage 
bisects much 
of the 
area which 
includes contour 
and highwall 
miner reserve 
 from 
six 
seams. 
The 
Toney 
Fork 
reserve 
includes 
11.3 
Mt 
of 
both 
permitted 
and 
not-permitted 
 status. 
There 
is one 
active permit 
-- Toney 
Fork Mine 
No 3 
(S-5007-09). 
In 2022, 
few 
tons 
were 
 mined from this permit. 

 Mine depletion from 
surface and 
underground mining, 
seam dependent, exists 
in all seams 
of the 
 Toney 
Fork reserve 
which include the 
Upper Coalburg, Lower 
Coalburg, Lower 
Dorothy, 
Chilton A, 
 Upper Winifrede and Lower Winifrede seams. 

 12.2.1.2
 Buffalo Creek South 
 Buffalo 
Creek 
South 
surface 
area 
includes 
an 
estimated 
15.0 
Mt 
from 
projected 
contour 
and 
 highwall mines. 
The reserve total includes both permitted and not-permitted tonnages. 
Permitted 
 tonnages are 
estimated from 
four surface 
mine permits 
-- North 
Fork Winifrede 
Contour (S-5004-
 17), Middle Fork 
Surface (S-5004-22), 
and two 
at Elk Lick 
(S-5014-10 
S-5008-22). 
In 2022, a 
few 
 tonnes were mined and only at Elk Lick. 

 The highwall 
mineable tonnage 
is estimated 
for six 
seams with 
adequate seam 
heights which 
include 
 the 
Lower 
Coalburg, 
Lower 
Dorothy, 
Chilton, 
Chilton 
A, 
Buffalo 
Creek 
and 
the 
Upper 
Winifrede. 

 Contour mine 
tonnage is 
derived from 
the highwall 
mine seams, along 
with four 
additional seams 
 with acceptable 
seam thickness. 
They include the 
Lower Clarion, Upper 
Stockton, Lower 
Stockton 
 and Upper Coalburg. 
Mine depletion to various extents exists in the Buffalo 
Creek South seams.

 12.2.2.1
 Upper Winifrede (No 8) Seam 
 The Upper Winifrede seam includes two underground reserves, the permitted North Fork Mine (U-
 5009-19) 
and 
a 
not-permitted 
proposed 
Upper 
Winifrede 
mine. 
The 
active 
North 
Fork 
Mine 
is 
 situated on a narrow 
ridge between two drainages, 
has an average 
seam thickness of 1.42 meters, 
 and includes an 
estimated 0.2 Mt. 
The Proposed Upper 
Winifrede mine reserve 
displays some seam 
 splitting, has an average 
seam thickness of 1.64 meters, 
and includes an estimated 
1.8 Mt. 
On the 
 Property, 
the 
Upper 
Winifrede 
seam 
has 
been 
extensively 
mined 
from 
both 
surface 
and 
 underground mining. 
 12.2.2.2
 Chilton (Williamson) Seam 
 The 
Chilton 
seam 
reserve 
includes 
an 
estimated 
5.4 
Mt 
from 
two 
proposed 
mine 
areas: 
Camp 
 Branch 
and Elk 
Lick. 
The average 
seam height 
for 
the two 
areas is 
1.17 meters 
and 1.06 
meters, 
 respectively. 
On 
the 
Property, 
the 
Chilton 
seam 
has 
been 
extensively 
mined, 
mainly 
by 
 underground mining. 
 12.2.2.3
 Upper Powellton (Upper Alma) 
 The Powellton 
No 1 
Mine permit provides 
access to 
the remaining 
3.6 Mt of 
the Upper 
Powellton 
 reserve. 
The 
seam 
has 
an 
average 
thickness 
of 
nearly 
1.12 
meters. 
The 
mine 
is 
bound 
by 
the 
 property extent to the northeast and 
thin coal from a seam 
split to the 
west. 
The south end 
of Mine 
 No. 1 is mined out. 
Elsewhere, no prior Upper Powellton seam mining is noted on the Property. 
 12.2.2.4
 Lower Powellton (Lower Alma) 
 The 
Lower 
Powellton 
seam 
reserve 
includes 
an 
estimated 
5.1 
Mt 
from 
a 
proposed 
mine 
area 
 situated 
north 
of 
Toney 
Fork. 
In 
the 
mapped 
resource 
area, 
the 
interval 
to 
the 
overlying 
Upper 
 Powellton seam is in a range of 5.1 to 7.2 meters. 
Therefore, only resources (exclusive 
of reserves) 
 are projected 
below the 
Upper Powellton 
underground 
mine where 
the two 
seams overlap. 
The 
 Lower Powellton 
seam has 
an average 
reserve thickness 
of 0.89 
meters 
and is 
bound by 
property 
 control to the north, by 
low coal to the 
west and south and 
from overmining in the 
Upper Powellton 
 seam to the east. 
No prior Lower Powellton seam mining is noted on the Property.

 No. 2 Gas-Lower (Eagle) 
 The No 2 Gas-Lower seam reserve includes an estimated 15.5 Mt. 
The demonstrated total includes 
 both permitted and not permitted tonnes. 
Two active mines access the reserve -- the Eagle No. 1 / 
 Toney Fork Mine (U-5013-11) from Toney Fork Drainage and the Muddy Bridge 1 
 2 Mine 
(U-5034-
 96, U-5035-96) 
from Muddy 
Bridge Branch 
of Huff 
Creek. 
Mine boundaries 
of the 
two mines 
are 
 immediately 
adjacent 
to 
one 
another 
and 
mine plans 
maximize 
the 
mineable area. 
The

1.00 
meter 
and 
1.52 
meters 
for 
the 
Eagle 
No. 
1 
and 
Muddy 
Bridge 
mines, 
 respectively. 
On the Property, 
the No. 2 
Gas-Lower reserve 
is limited by 
low coal thickness 
to the 
 east and seam outcrop along large drainages elsewhere. 
Previous underground mining of the seam 
 is mapped immediately west of the Property. 

 12.2.2.6
 Lower War Eagle 

 The 
Lower 
War 
Eagle 
seam reserve 
includes an

 Qualified Person s Estimates 
 Reserve tonnage 
estimates provided 
herein report 
coal reserves 
derived from 
the in-situ resource 
 tonnes presented 
in 
 Table 
11-3
 , and 
not in 
addition to 
coal resources. 
Proven 
and probable 
coal 
 reserves 
were 
derived 
from 
the 
defined 
coal 
resource 
considering 
relevant 
mining, 
processing, 
 infrastructure, 
economic 
(including 
estimates 
of 
capital, 
revenue, 
and 
cost), 
marketing, 
legal, 
 environmental, 
socio-economic and regulatory 
factors. 
The coal reserves, 
as shown in 
 Table 
12-2
 , 
 are 
based on 
a technical 
evaluation 
of the 
geology and 
a preliminary 
feasibility 
study 
of the 
coal 
 deposits. 
The 
extent 
to 
which 
the

 Note: Marketable reserve tonnes are reported on a moist basis, including a combination of surface and inherent moisture. 
The combination of 
 surface and inherent moisture is modeled between 4.5 and 6-percent, depending upon mining method. 
Actual product moisture is 
 dependent upon multiple geological factors, operational factors, and product contract specifications and can exceed 8-percent. 
As such, the 
 modeled moisture values provide a level of conservatism for reserve reporting. 
 The 
results 
of 
this 
TRS 
define 
an 
estimated 
70.6 
Mt 
of 
proven 
and 
probable 
marketable 
coal 
 reserves. 
Of that total, 75 percent are proven, and 25 percent are probable. 
All 70.6 Mt are leased 
 coal reserves and 
are assigned. 
Approximately 61.6 
Mt of reserves are 
considered suitable for 
the 
 metallurgical coal market 
and 9.0 Mt are projected to be sold into the thermal coal market.
 12.4
 Qualified Person s Opinion 
 The 
estimate 
of coal 
reserves was 
determined 
in accordance 
with the 
JORC 
Code along 
with SEC 
 Regulation S-K 1300. 
 The LOM mining 
plan for 
Logan was prepared 
to the 
level of 
preliminary feasibility. 
Mine projections 
 were 
prepared, 
and 
timing 
scheduled 
to 
match 
production 
with 
coal 
seam 
characteristics. 

 Production timing was carried 
out from current locations to depletion 
of the coal 
reserve area. 
Coal 
 reserve estimates could be materially affected 
by the risk factors described in 
 Section 22.2
 . 
 Based on the Preliminary Feasibility Study 
and the attendant Economic Review, the QPs believe this 
 is a fair and accurate calculation of the Logan 
coal reserves. 
 13
 Mining Methods 
 Nine underground 
and three 
surface mining 
areas were 
modeled and 
tested 
economically. 
Once 
 the Resources were calculated, mine plans were created to project operating each resource area to 
 depletion, with crews 
and equipment scheduled to 
move to subsequent 
mining areas as depletion 
 occurs. 
Underground mine operations 
are projected to 
be exhausted in 
2045, surface mines 
deplete 
 in 2055 and the highwall miners finish in 2056.

 Geotech and Hydrology 
 Mining 
plans 
for 
potential 
underground 
mines 
were 
developed 
by 
Coronado 
and 
MM A. 
Pillar 
 stability 
was 
tested 
by MM A 
using the 
 Analysis of 
Coal Pillar 
Stability 
(ACPS)
 
program 
that 
was 
 developed by the 
 National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health NIOSH)
 . 
MM A reviewed 
 the results 
from the ACPS 
and ALPS analysis 
and considered them 
in the development 
of the LOM 
 plan. 
 For the HWM operation, Mining cuts are approximately 
2.9 meters wide, and cuts are typically laid 
 out on approximately 5.03-meter centers. 
A 2.1-meter to 2.4-meter solid coal fender is left 
in place 
 between 
cuts. 
The 
mining 
plan 
provides 
that 
larger 
barrier 
pillars 
be 
provided 
periodically, 
 depending on overburden depth and characteristics 
and the immediate roof composition, typically 
 after 15 
to 20 
cuts. 
Although this 
plan, with 
minor variations, 
is common 
throughout Appalachia, 
 specific 
rock 
and 
coal 
strength 
information 
is used 
to 
verify 
whether 
or 
not 
this 
plan 
provided 
a 
 sufficient factor of safety. 
 Hydrology 
has not 
been an 
issue of 
concern at 
Logan. 
Based on 
numerous 
site visits 
to both 
the 
 surface and 
underground portions 
of the 
Property by 
the QPs, 
it has 
been determined 
that this 
is 
 not 
a 
significant 
concern. 
Mining 
of 
future 
reserves 
is 
projected 
to 
occur 
in 
areas 
which 
exhibit 
 similar hydrogeological characteristics 
as those formerly mined areas. 
 13.2
 Production Rates 
 Operations 
at 
Logan 
by Coronado 
and 
its predecessors 
have 
been on-going 
for 
many 
years. 
The 
 mine plan and productivity expectations reflect historical performance and efforts have been made 
 to adjust the plan to reflect future conditions. 
MM A is confident that the mine plan is reasonably 
 representative 
to 
provide 
an 
accurate 
estimation 
of 
coal

development 
and 
 operation have not been optimized within the TRS. 
 Carlson Mining software was 
used by MM A to 
generate mine 
plans for the mineable 
coal seams. 

 Mine 
plans 
were 
sequenced based 
on productivity 
schedules provided 
by Coronado, 
which were 
 based 
on 
historically 
achieved 
productivity 
levels. 
All

assumed 
 production 
rates 
to 
geological 
models 
as 
constructed 
by MM A s 
team 
of 
geologists 
and 
mining 
 engineers. 
 The projected underground mines are set up similarly to the four currently active operations. 
Each 
 mine is 
scheduled to 
operate 
one to 
three production 
sections. 
All sections 
are configured 
as full 
 supersections with two continuous 
miners per section. 
In all cases, 
mines are forecasted to produce 
 coal two or three shifts each day. 
In most cases the third shift is reserved for maintenance and belt 
 and 
power 
moves. 
Production 
is scheduled 
Monday 
through 
Friday 
each week, 
and 
every 
other 
 Saturday. 
 Three surface resource areas were modeled. 
Mining operations are projected to utilize area 
mining 
 as well as contour mining CTR) methods with an emphasis on creating highwall for highwall mining

 activity. 
The projected operations will 
employ two existing 
front-end loaders capable 
of a 
combined 
 production rate 
of approximately 
8,900 bcm/hr with 
supplemental assistance 
of 6 dozers 
that can 
 generate an additional 700 bcm/hr providing their spoil placement does not interfere with planned 
 highwall mining activity. 
The older, higher-hour front end loader will 
be replaced in 
early 2023 
with 
 a higher production hydraulic excavator 
that will increase the capability of the loading machines to 
 11,300 bcm/hr. 
The dozers will continue supplementing the loading production on a periodic basis 
 as described previously. 
The potential production 
level of combined 
machines is not projected 
to 
 be 
achieved 
until 
2024 
and 
not 
consistently 
until 
2027 
due 
to 
lack 
of 
sufficient 
working 
 areas. 
Sufficient reserves allow mining to continue to the year 2055. 
 The models assume 
that the operations 
will work two, 
10-hour production shifts, 
5 days per 
week 
 plus every 
other Saturday, 
with sufficient 
staffing 
to float 
vacation 
during the 
year. 
A total 
of 82 
 employees are assumed for the surface mines at full production. 
 Coals from 
the surface 
operations 
are hauled 
to the 
loadout for 
direct ship 
or to 
the preparation 
 plant for washing ultimately to be blended to shipment s 
specifications. 
Saleable product from the 
 surface 
operations 
is 
projected 
to 
be 
sold 
primary 
into 
the 
thermal 
coal 
market 
on 
a 
raw 
basis; 
 however, 
some production is planned to be washed for the metallurgical 
coal market. 

 The three 
areas planned 
for highwall 
mining are 
assumed to 
be mined 
by a 
contractor; 
therefore, 
 the contractor 
costs included 
in the 
financial model 
assume that 
the contractor 
is responsible 
for 
 staffing those operations along with providing 
necessary equipment capital. 
 Spoil for 
final highwall 
reclamation is 
expected to 
come from 
strategic 
placement of 
spoil on 
pre-
 existing benches by 
haul trucks 
such that 
they are within 
the push 
distance of the 
reclamation dozer.

 Surface Mines and Highwall Miners 
 Three surface resource areas were modeled. 
Mining operations are projected to utilize area 
mining 
 as well as contour mining CTR) methods with an emphasis on creating highwall for highwall mining 
 activity. 
The projected operations will 
employ two existing 
front-end loaders capable 
of a 
combined 
 production rate 
of approximately 
8,900 bcm/hr with 
supplemental assistance 
of 6 dozers 
that can 
 generate an additional 700 bcm/hr providing their spoil placement does not interfere with planned 
 highwall 
mining 
activity. 
The 
older, 
higher-hour 
front 
end 
loader 
will 
be replaced

 with 
a

production 
hydraulic 
excavator 
that 
will 
increase 
the 
capability 
of 
the 
loading 
 machines to 
11,300 bcm/hr. 
The dozers 
will continue 
supplementing the loading 
production on 
a 
 periodic basis as described previously. 
The potential production level of combined machines is not 
 projected to be achieved until 2024 and not 
consistently until 2027 due to lack of sufficient working 
 areas. 
Sufficient reserves allow mining to continue to the year 2055.
 The models assume 
that the operations 
will work two, 
10-hour production shifts, 
5 days per 
week 
 plus every 
other Saturday, 
with sufficient 
staffing 
to float 
vacation 
during the 
year. 
A total 
of 82 
 employees are assumed for the surface mines at full production. 
 It 
is 
assumed 
that 
most 
of 
the 
spoil 
movement 
goes 
through 
a 
shovel 
or 
loader 
bucket 
and 
is 
 eventually returned to the pit for final 
reclamation. 
The dozer s primary responsibility is cutting the 
 initial benches for the drill and shaping the reclaimed contour highwall. 

 All highwall 
mining is assumed 
to be performed 
by a contractor. 
The contractor 
is responsible for 
 staffing those operations along with providing 
necessary equipment capital. 
 Spoil for 
final highwall 
reclamation is 
expected to 
come from 
strategic 
placement of 
spoil on 
pre-
 existing benches by 
haul trucks 
such that 
they are within 
the push 
distance of the 
reclamation dozer.

 Toney 
Fork 
 Toney 
Fork surface mining operations are projected to be mined from 2028 to 2055, with emphasis 
 placed on preparing space 
for HWM operations. 
Expected production for 
the operations averages 
 approximately 232,000 marketable 
tonnes. 
 The 
Toney

HWM 
operates 
from

auger/HWM 
production 
is 
projected 
to 
finish 
in

 Description or Flowsheet 
 The Logan 
County Division 
includes the 
Saunders Preparation 
Plant in 
addition to 
the mines. 
The 
 plant site includes raw coal storage, clean coal storage, a railroad loadout, and refuse disposal area. 

 The 
plant has 
a feed 
rate 
capacity 
of 1,088 
raw 
tonnes 
per hour. 
Primary separation 
equipment 
 includes 
a 
heavy 
media 
vessel, 
heavy 
media 
cyclones, 
classifying cyclones, 
spirals, 
flotation 
cells, 
 and 
column 
flotation, 
supported 
by 
the 
requisite 
screens, 
centrifuges, 
vacuum 
filters, 
sumps, 
 pumps, 
and 
distribution 
systems. 
Coarse 
and 
fine 
refuse 
are 
disposed 
separately 
in 
an 
adjacent 
 refuse area which incorporates slurry cells. 
 Processes and 
equipment are 
typical of 
those used in 
the coal 
industry and are 
in use in 
nearly all 
 plants in the Central Appalachian Basin.

 Personnel 
have 
historically 
been 
sourced 
from 
the 
surrounding

 current mines. 
As mining is 
common in 
the surrounding 
areas, the 
workforce 
is generally 
familiar 
 with mining practices and is comprised of a strong talent pool of experienced miners. 
 Water 
is sourced 
locally from 
Buffalo Creek 
Public Service 
District and/or 
locally from 
streams via 
 water 
withdrawal 
permits, and 
electricity 
is sourced 
from 
AEP. 
The 
service industry 
in the 
areas 
 surrounding the 
mine complex 
has historically provided 
supplies, equipment 
repairs and fabrication, 
 etc. 

 15
 Infrastructure 
 The 
Coronado-owned 
Saunders 
Preparation 
Plant 
services the 
mines. 
The 
ROM 
coal 
is delivered 
 from 
the 
Lower 
War 
Eagle 
Mine 
via 
overland 
conveyor, 
all 
remaining 
production 
is 
or 
will 
be 
 delivered to the plant site by truck. 
 The CSX rail line serves as the main means of transport from the mine complex/loadout. 
 As an active operation, the necessary support infrastructure for 
Logan is in place. 
 As new areas 
are developed, the 
infrastructure requirements will change. 
These changes have 
been 
 considered in the LOM plans and financial model. 
 Most of the 
seams lie below 
drainage; however, several metallurgical coal seams are situated above 
 drainage. 
The 
underground 
mining 
resource 
areas 
which 
are 
located 
above-drainage 
require 
an 
 access road 
and mine 
access development 
along the 
outcrop, whereas 
below-drainage 
mines are 
 accessed based on other 
proposed surface infrastructure locations and/or surface property control. 

 In some cases, the 
access and face-up 
may be developed as 
part of surface 
mining activities. 
A mine 
 transformer 
and water tank 
are located 
at the face-up, 
along with the mine 
fan, stacker 
conveyor, 
 supply facilities, shop, office, and bath house. 
 The 
surface 
mining 
mobile 
equipment 
spreads 
advance 
the 
contour 
and 
area 
mining 
pits 
while 
 systematically reclaiming the trailing side of pits where coal has 
been removed. 
The coal haul roads 
 are extended and 
maintained as 
the pits 
advance. 
Support facilities are 
maintained nearby 
but away 
 from the active mining, and include storage areas for blasting 
agents, fuel and lubricants, and mine 
 supplies along with maintenance facilities and offices. 
 The HWM equipment advances along with the contour mining pits. 
The rate of advance of contour 
 mining is 
somewhat constrained by 
the advancement rate 
of the 
HWM. 
A diesel-powered generator 
 trails 
the 
highwall 
miner 
and 
powers 
the 
continuous 
mining 
unit. 
Other 
support 
facilities 
are 
 provided along with the contour mining support facilities. 

 A map of the existing facilities in 
 Figure 15-1
 
shows the layout of the required infrastructure.

 Market Studies 
 16.1
 Market Description 
 The quality 
characteristics for 
the subject 
coal resources 
and coal 
reserves have 
been reviewed 
in 
 detail by MM A. 
The drill hole data was utilized to develop average 
coal quality characteristics for 
 the 
mining 
site. 
These 
average 
coal 
quality 
characteristics 
were 
then 
utilized 
as 
the 
basis 
for 
 determining the various markets into which the saleable coal will likely 
be placed. 

 The projected quality specifications for the Logan products 
are as shown in

 Price Forecasts 
 Coronado provided 
MM A with 
price forecasts 
for its 
active operations. 
Customer coal 
pricing is 
 derived 
from 
market 
observed 
forward 
estimates 
based 
on 
global economic 
supply 
and 
demand 
 analysis 
which 
is 
applied 
to 
mine 
plan 
sales 
volumes 
and 
product 
mix 
and 
is 
supplemented 
with 
 Coronado s in-house knowledge of applicable rail transportation charges, ocean 
freight charges and 
 port charges. 
MM A utilized this data for price forecasting 
in financial modeling. 
Concurrent with 
 aforementioned-quality 
parameters 
in 
the 
preceding 
section, 
production 
from 
the 
proposed 
 operations 
is 
assumed 
to 
be 
primarily 
sold 
in 
metallurgical 
markets 
with 
limited 
thermal 
sales. 

 Pricing was provided through calendar year 2056. 

 Coal price forecasts 
for the Logan products 
were provided by 
Coronado for various 
coal markets in 
 terms of US nominal dollars per metric tonne. 

 16.3
 Contract Requirements 
 Some 
contracts 
are 
necessary 
for 
successful 
marketing 
of 
the 
coal. 
For 
Logan, 
since 
all 
mining, 
 preparation and marketing is done in-house, the remaining 
contracts required are: 
 > 
 Transportation
 
 The Mine contracts with the CSX Railroad to transport the coal to either the 
 domestic customers or to the Pier 9 and Dominion terminals at Norfolk, Virginia 
for overseas 
 shipment. 
 > 
 Sales 
 Sales contracts are a mix of spot and contract sales. 
With the volatility of the market, 
 long-term contracts are not typically written.

 Environmental Studies, Permitting and Plans, 
 Negotiations or Agreements with Local Individuals 
 17.1
 Results of Studies 
 MM A completed a Limited Phase I Environmental Site Assessment ESA) on the Logan Property in 
 May 2017 
on behalf of 
Coronado. 
Coronado reports 
not having 
conducted such 
a study 
since the 
 MM A 
studies. 
The 
ESA
 
completed 
by 
MM A 
included 
a 
site 
inspection, 
review 
of 
historical 
 records, 
a 
database 
search 
of 
State 
and 
Federal 
regulatory 
records 
and 
interviews 
to 
identify 
 potential 
recognized 
environmental 
conditions RECs) 
that 
may 
create 
environmental 
liability 
for 
 the sites. 
MM A concluded that no long-term liabilities existed at the time of these ESAs. 
 Based on these former ESAs completed by MM A, it is the QPs 
 
opinion that Logan has a generally 
 typical coal industry record of compliance with 
applicable mining, water quality, and environmental 
 laws. 
Estimated costs for mine closure, including water 
quality monitoring during site reclamation, 
 are included in the financial models. 
 17.2
 Requirements and Plans for Waste 
Disposal 
 The original 
design for 
the North 
Fork Refuse 
Area North Fork) at 
the Logan 
Property projected 
a 
 crest 
to 
elevation 
686 
meters. 
The 
present 
elevation 
of 
the 
deck 
is 
 685meters. 
In 
2018 
MSHA 
 approved an expansion plan to raise 
the cross-valley crest to 
elevation 802 meters, and from 
there 
 converting 
to 
a 
sidehill 
fill. 
This 
will 
allow 
for 
a 
total 
volume 
of 
50 
million 
CM 
which 
would 
be 
 sufficient 
capacity for 
all the 
refuse generated 
by the 
LOM plan 
that underpins 
the current 
Logan 
 County Division reserves. 
Further plans for 
the North Fork 
site call for conversion of 
the fill 
to a total 
 cross-valley configuration, predicated 
on completion of surface mining on the ridge between North 
 Fork and Middle Fork. 
This has the potential of providing an additional 10 million CM of capacit
 y. 
 17.3
 Permit Requirements and Status 
 All 
mining 
operations 
are 
subject 
to 
federal 
and 
state 
laws 
and 
must 
obtain 
permits 
to 
operate 
 mines, coal preparation and related facilities, 
haul roads, and other incidental surface disturbances 
 necessary for 
mining to 
occur. 
Permits 
generally 
require 
that 
the 
permittee 
post 
a 
performance 
 bond in 
an amount 
established by the 
regulatory program to provide 
assurance that any 
disturbance 
 or liability 
created during 
mining operations 
is properly 
restored 
to an 
approved post-mining 
land 
 use and 
that all 
regulations and 
requirements 
of the 
permits are 
fully satisfied 
before 
the bond 
is 
 returned 
to 
the 
permittee. 
Significant 
penalties 
exist 
for 
any 
permittee 
who 
fails 
to 
meet 
the 
 obligations 
of 
the 
permits 
including 
cessation 
of 
mining 
operations, 
which 
can 
lead 
to 
potential 
 forfeiture 
of the 
bond. 
Any company, 
and its 
directors, 
owners and 
officers, which 
are subject 
to 
 bond forfeiture can be denied future permits under the program.

 New permits 
or permit 
revisions will occasionally 
be necessary 
to facilitate the 
expansion or 
addition 
 of new 
mining areas 
on the 
properties, such 
as amendments 
to existing 
permits and 
new permits 
 for mining 
of reserve 
areas. 
Exploration permits 
also are 
required. 
Property under 
lease includes 
 provisions 
for 
exploration 
among 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
lease. 
New 
or 
modified 
mining 
permits 
are 
 subject 
to 
a 
public 
advertisement 
process 
and 
comment 
period, 
and 
the 
public 
is 
provided 
an 
 opportunity 
to 
raise 
objections 
to 
any 
proposed 
mining 
operation. 
MM A 
is 
not 
aware 
of 
any 
 specific 
prohibition 
of 
mining 
on 
the 
subject 
property 
and 
given 
sufficient 
time 
and 
planning, 
 Coronado should 
be able 
to secure 
new permits 
to maintain 
its planned mining 
operations within 
 the context of current regulations. 
Necessary permits are in 
place to support current production on 
 the properties, but future permits are required to maintain and expand 
production. 
Portions of the 
 properties 
are 
located 
near local 
communities. 
Regulations 
prohibit 
mining activities 
within 91.4 
 meters 
of a 
residential dwelling, 
school, church, 
or similar 
structure unless 
written consent 
is first 
 obtained 
from 
the 
owner 
of 
the 
structure. 
Where 
required, 
such 
consents 
have 
been 
obtained 
 where mining is proposed beyond the regulatory limits. 
 Coronado 
has 
obtained 
all 
mining 
and 
discharge 
permits 
to 
operate 
its 
mines 
and 
processing, 
 loadout 
or 
related 
facilities. 
MM A 
is 
unaware 
of 
any 
obvious 
or 
current 
Coronado 
permitting 
 issues 
that 
are 
expected 
to 
prevent 
the 
issuance 
of 
future 
permits. 
Logan, 
along 
with 
all 
coal 
 producers, 
is subject 
to a 
level of 
uncertainty regarding

 Local Plans, Negotiations or Agreements 
 MM A found no indication of agreements beyond the scope of Federal 
or State Regulations. 
 17.5
 Mine Closure Plans 
 Applicable 
regulations 
require 
that 
mines 
be 
properly 
closed, 
and 
reclamation 
commenced 
 immediately 
upon 
abandonment. 
In 
general, 
site 
reclamation 
includes 
removal 
of 
structures, 
 backfilling, regrading, 
and revegetation 
of disturbed 
areas. 
For surface 
mines, the 
majority of the 
 expense for 
backfilling and regrading 
is completed as part 
of ongoing mining operations, 
with only 
 reclamation 
of 
final 
pits 
and 
HWM 
benches 
required 
at 
end-of-mine 
life. 
Sediment 
control 
is 
 required 
during the 
establishment 
of vegetation, 
and bond 
release generally 
requires 
a minimum 
 five-year 
period 
of 
site 
maintenance, 
water 
sampling, 
and 
sediment 
control 
following 
mine 
 completion. 
This requirement 
is reduced 
to two 
years 
for 
certain operations 
involving re 
-mining. 

 Reclamation 
of underground 
mines includes 
closure and 
sealing of 
mine openings 
such as 
portals 
 and shafts in addition to the items listed above. 

 Estimated 
costs 
for 
mine closure, 
including water 
quality monitoring 
during site 
reclamation, 
are 
 included in 
the financial 
models. 
As with 
all mining 
companies, an 
accretion calculation is 
performed 
 annually 
so the 
necessary Asset 
Retirement 
Obligations ARO) can 
be shown 
as 
a Liability 
on the 
 Balance Sheet. 
 17.6
 Qualified Person s Opinion 
 The Logan complex 
is an operating 
facility; all necessary permits 
for current 
production have 
been 
 obtained. 
The QPs 
know
 
of no reason 
that any 
permits revisions 
that may 
be required 
cannot be 
 obtained. 

 Estimated expenditures for site 
closure and reclamation are included in the financial model for this 
 site.

 Capital and Operating Costs 
 18.1
 Capital Cost Estimate 
 The production sequence selected for 
a property must consider the proximity 
of each reserve area 
 to 
coal 
preparation 
plants, 
river 
docks 
and 
railroad 
loading 
points, 
along 
with 
suitability 
of 
 production equipment to coal seam conditions. 
The in-place infrastructure was evaluated, and any 
 future needs were planned to a level suitable for a Preliminary Feasibility Study and included in the 
 Capital Forecast. 
 Coronado provided MM A with an inventory of operating equipment available 
at Logan. 
MM A s 
 capital schedules 
assume that 
major equipment 
rebuilds occur 
over the 
course of 
each machine s 
 remaining 
assumed 
operating 
life. 
Replacement 
equipment 
was 
scheduled 
based 
on

 Operating Cost Estimate 
 Coronado 
provided 
historical 
and 
a 
preliminary 
5-year 
projection 
of operating 
costs 
for 
MM A s 
 review. 
MM A used the historical and/or budget cost information 
as a reference and developed a 
 personnel 
schedule 
for 
the 
mine. 
Hourly 
labor 
rates 
and 
salaries 
were 
based 
upon 
information 
 contained in Coronado s financial summaries. 
Fringe benefit costs were developed 
for vacation and 
 holidays, 
federal 
and 
state 
unemployment 
insurance, 
retirement, 
workers 
compensation 
and 
 pneumoconiosis, 
casualty 
and 
life 
insurance, 
healthcare 
and 
bonuses. 
A 
cost 
factor 
for 
mine 
 supplies was developed that 
relates expenditures 
to mine advance rates 
for roof 
control costs 
and 
 other 
mine 
supply 
costs 
experienced 
at 
underground 
mines. 
Other 
factors 
were 
developed 
for 
 maintenance and repair costs, rentals, mine power, 
outside services and other direct mining costs. 

 Other 
cost 
factors 
were 
developed 
for 
coal 
preparation 
plant 
processing, 
refuse 
handling, 
coal 
 loading, property 
taxes, 
and insurance 
and bonding. 
Appropriate 
royalty 
rates 
were 
assigned for 
 production 
from 
leased coal 
lands 
and 
sales taxes 
were 
calculated 
for 
state 
severance 
taxes, 
the 
 federal black lung excise tax, 
and federal and state reclam 
ation fees. 
 Mandated Sales Related Costs such as Black Lung Excise are 
summarized in

 Economic Analysis 
 19.1
 Assumptions, Parameters and Methods 
 A pre-feasibility LOM plan 
was prepared by 
MM A for the 
Logan operations. 
MM A prepared mine

 was carried 
out from 
2023 to 
depletion (exhaustion) 
of the 
coal reserve 
areas, which 
is projected 
 for the year 2056. 
All costs and prices are based on 2022 nominal United States dollars. 
 The Mine 
plan, productivity 
expectations and cost 
estimates generally reflect 
historical performance 
 by 
Coronado 
and 
efforts 
have 
been 
made 
to 
adjust 
plans 
and 
costs 
to 
reflect 
future 
conditions. 

 MM A is confident 
that the mine 
plan and 
financial model 
are reasonably representative to provide 
 an accurate estimation of coal reserves. 
 Capital 
schedules were 
developed by 
MM A for 
mine development, 
infrastructure, 
and on-going 
 capital 
requirements 
for 
the 
life 
of the 
mine. 
Staffing 
levels 
were 
prepared, 
and operating 
costs 
 estimated 
by 
MM A. 
MM A 
utilized 
historical 
cost 
data 
provided 
by 
Coronado 
and 
its 
own 
 knowledge and experience to estimate direct and indirect operating 
costs. 

 The 
preliminary 
feasibility 
financial 
model, 
prepared 
for 
this 
TRS, 
was 
developed 
to 
test 
the 
 economic viability of 
the coal reserve 
area. 
The results of 
this financial model 
are not intended 
to 
 represent 
a 
bankable 
feasibility 
study, 
required 
for 
financing 
of 
any 
current 
or 
future 
mining 
 operations, 
but 
are 
intended 
to 
prove 
the 
economic 
viability 
of the 
estimated 
coal 
reserves. 
All 
 costs and prices are based on 2022 nominal United States dollars assuming a 2 inflation rate. 
 On an unlevered basis, the NPV of the project cash flows after taxes was 
estimated for the purpose 
 of 
classifying 
coal 
reserves. 
The 
project 
cash 
flows, 
excluding 
debt 
service, 
are 
calculated 
by 
 subtracting direct 
and indirect 
operating expenses 
and capital 
expenditures from 
revenue. 
Direct 
 costs include labor, drilling and 
blasting, operating supplies, 
maintenance and repairs, 
facilities costs 
 for 
materials 
handling, 
coal 
preparation, 
refuse 
disposal, 
coal 
loading, 
sampling 
and 
analysis 
 services, 
reclamation 
and 
general 
and 
administrative 
costs. 
Indirect 
costs 
include 
statutory 
and 
 legally 
agreed 
upon 
fees 
related 
to 
direct 
extraction 
of 
the 
mineral. 
The 
indirect 
costs 
are 
the 
 Federal 
black 
lung 
tax, 
Federal 
and 
State 
reclamation 
taxes, 
property 
taxes, 
local 
transportation 
 prior to delivery at rail or barge loading sites, coal production royalties, sales and use taxes, income 
 taxes 
and 
State 
severance 
taxes. 
Coronado s 
historical 
costs 
provided 
a 
useful 
reference 
for 
 MM A s 
cost estimates. 
 Sales revenue is based on 
the metallurgical coal price information provided to MM A 
by Coronado. 
 Projected 
debt 
service 
is 
excluded 
from 
the 
P L 
and 
cash 
flow 
model 
in 
order 
to 
determine 
 Enterprise Value. 
 The financial model expresses coal sales prices, operating costs, and capital expenditures in current 
 day 
dollars 
without 
adjustment 
for 
inflation. 
Capital 
expenditures 
and 
reclamation 
costs 
are 
 included based 
on engineering 
estimates for 
each mine 
by year. 
The Coronado 
division s 
existing 
 allocations of administrative costs are 
continued in the future projections. 
 Coronado will pay royalties for the various current and projected operations. 
The royalty rates vary 
 by mining method and location. 
The royalty rates for Logan are estimated to be 5 to 9 
of the sales 
 revenue.

losses 
are 
 carried over to offset future taxable 
income. 
The terms cash flows and project cash flows used 
 in this report refer to after tax 
cash flows. 
 Consolidated cash flows are driven 
by annual sales 
tonnage, which at steady-state level ranges from 
 a peak of 3.3 million 
tonnes in 2028 to 
a low of 1.0 million tonnes 
in 2054. 
Projected consolidated 
 revenue ranges from 151.9 million to 480.3 million 
at a steady state. 
Revenue totals 11.4 billion 
 for the project s life. 
 Consolidated cash flow from operations is positive throughout the projected operating period, with 
 the 
exception 
of post 
-production 
years, 
due to 
end-of-mine 
reclamation 
spending. 
Consolidated 
 cash flow from operations 
peaks at 110.1 million in 
2038 and totals 2.5 billion over 
the project s 
 life. 
Capital 
expenditures 
total 
 190.2 
million 
from 
2023 
through 
2027 and 
 1.2 
billion 
over 
the 
 project s life. 

 Coal price forecasts for coal 
products were prepared by Coronado 
for its proposed operations. 
Such 
 prices 
were 
used 
for 
the 
revenue 
input 
into 
the 
financial 
model. 
Sales 
variable 
costs 
such 
as 
 production royalties and severance 
taxes were based upon the revenue 
input.

 Results 
 The 
pre-feasibility 
financial 
model, 
prepared 
by 
MM A 
for 
this 
TRS, 
was 
developed 
to 
test 
the 
 economic viability of 
each coal resource 
area. 
The results of 
this financial model 
are not intended 
 to represent 
a bankable feasibility 
study, 
as may be 
required for 
financing of any 
current or future 
 mining operations contemplated but are intended 
to prove the economic viability of the estimated 
 coal reserves. 
Optimization of the LOM plan was outside the scope of the engagement. 
 Figure 19-1
 
shows the annual variance of cash costs per ton. 

 Table 19-1
 
shows LOM tonnage, P L, 
 and EBITDA for Logan.

 Other Relevant Data and Information 
 MM A performed 
a previous 
audit of 
all the 
Properties in 
year 2017 
for 
Coronado 
based on 
SEC 
 Industry 
Guide 7 
standards. 
In addition, 
MM A completed 
a Limited 
Phase I 
Environmental 
Site 
 Assessment ESA) 
on 
the 
Property 
in 
2017 
on 
behalf 
of 
Coronado. 
MM A 
has 
subsequently 
 conducted Joint Ore Reserve Committee JORC) compliant resource and reserve assessments of the 
 Logan County 
assets as of: 
(1) December 31, 
2017, (2) December 
31, 2020, and 
(3) December 31, 
 2021. 
By 
assignment, 
the 
JORC 
assessment 
included 
a 
preliminary 
feasibility 
level 
study 
of 
the 
 subject coal reserves, encompassing detailed 
mine planning and cost analysis through 
depletion of 
 Logan s 
JORC-compliant coal 
reserves. 
MM A utilized these 
former preliminary 
feasibility studies 
 as the basis of an updated study which meets those standards set forth by the SEC.

 Interpretation and Conclusions 
 22.1
 Conclusion 
 Sufficient data 
has been obtained 
through various 
exploration and 
sampling programs 
and mining 
 operations 
to 
support 
the 
geological 
interpretations 
of 
seam 
structure 
and 
thickness 
for 
coal 
 horizons 
situated 
on the 
Property. 
The data 
is of 
sufficient 
quantity 
and reliability 
to 
reasonably 
 support the coal resource and coal reserve estimates in this TRS. 
 The 
geological 
data 
and 
preliminary 
feasibility 
study, 
which 
consider 
mining 
plans, 
revenue, 
and 
 operating 
and 
capital 
cost 
estimates 
are 
sufficient 
to 
support 
the 
classification 
of 
coal 
reserves 
 provided herein. 
 This geologic evaluation conducted in conjunction with the preliminary feasibility study is sufficient 
 to 
conclude 
that 
the 
70.6 
Mt 
of 
marketable 
coal 
reserves 
identified 
on 
the 
Property 
are 
 economically 
mineable 
under 
reasonable 
expectations 
of 
market 
prices 
for 
metallurgical 
coal 
 products, estimated operation costs, 
and capital expenditures.

 Risk Factors 
 Risks have 
been identified 
for 
operational, 
technical and

 process 
are 
modelled 
to 
that 
presented 
in 
the 
Australian 
and 
New 
Zealand 
Standard 
on 
Risk 
 Management (AS/NZS 4360). 

 The 
purpose 
of 
the 
characterization 
of 
the 
project 
risk 
components 
is 
to 
inform 
the 
project 
 stakeholders 
of 
key 
aspects 
of 
the 
Coronado 
projects 
that 
can 
be 
impacted 
by 
events 
whose 
 consequences can affect 
the success of the venture. 
The significance of an impacted 
aspect of the 
 operation 
is 
directly 
related 
to 
both 
the 
probability 
of 
occurrence 
and 
the 
severity 
of 
the 
 consequences. 
The initial risk for 
a risk factor 
is herein defined 
as the risk level 
after the potential 
 impact 
of 
the 
risk 
factor 
is 
addressed 
by 
competent 
and 
prudent 
management 
utilizing 
control 
 measures readily available. 
Residual risk for a risk factor is herein defined as the risk 
level following 
 application 
of 
special 
mitigation 
measures 
if 
management 
determines 
that 
the 
initial 
risk 
level 
is 
 unacceptable. 
Initial risk and residual risk can be quantified numerically, 
derived by the product of 
 values assigned to probability and consequence ranging from very low risk to very high risk. 

 The probability and consequence 
parameters are subjective numerical estimates made 
by practiced 
 mine engineers and 
managers. 
Both are 
assigned values 
from 1 to 
5 for which 
the value 
1 represents 
 the 
lowest 
probability 
and least 
consequence, 
and the 
value 
5 represents 
the highest 
probability 
 and greatest consequence. 
The products which define the Risk Level are classified 
from very low to 
 very high.

 Risk aspects 
identified and 
evaluated 
during this 
assignment total 
13. 
No residual 
risks are 
rated 
 Very High. 
One (1) residual risk is rated 
High. 
Eight (8) of the risk aspects could be associated 
with 
 Moderate residual risk. 
Four (4) of the risk aspects were attributed Low or Very 
Low residual risks.

 Governing Assumptions 
 The listing of the aspects is 
not presumed to be exhaustive. 
Instead that listing is 
presented based 
 on the experiences of the contributors to the TRS. 

 1.
 The probability and consequence ratings are subjectively assigned, and it is assumed that 
 this subjectivity reasonably reflects the condition of the active and projected mine 
 operations. 
 2.
 The Control Measures shown in the matrices presented in this chapter 
are not exhaustive. 

 They represent a condensed collection of activities that the author of the risk assessment 
 section has observed to be effective in coal mining scenarios.

The 
 measures listed, however, 
have been observed by the author to be effective.

 The monetary values used in ranking the consequences are generally-accepted quantities 
for 
 the coal mining industry. 
 22.2.2
 Limitations 
 The risk assessment proposed in 
this report is subject to 
the limitations of the information currently 
 collected, tested, and interpreted 
at the time of the writing of the report. 
 22.2.3
 Methodology 
 The 
numerical 
quantities 
(i.e., 
risk 
levels) 
attributable 
to 
either 
 initial 
or 
 residual 
risks 
are 
 derived 
by the 
product 
of values 
assigned to 
probability 
and consequence 
ranging 
from 
very low 
 risk to very high risk. 
 R = P x C 
 Where: 
 R = Risk Level 
 P = Probability of Occurrence 
 C = Consequence of Occurrence 
 The Probability (P) and 
Consequence (C) parameters recited in the 
formula are subjective numerical 
 estimates 
made 
by 
practiced 
mine 
engineers 
and 
managers. 
Both 
P 
and 
C 
are 
assigned 
integer 
 values 
ranging 
from 
1 
to 
5 
for 
which 
the 
value 
1 
represents 
the 
lowest 
probability 
and 
least 
 consequence, 
and the 
value 5 
represents 
the highest 
probability 
and greatest 
consequence. 
The 
 products (R = P x C) which define the Risk Level, are 
thereafter classified from very low to very high. 
 Risk Level Table 
 Risk Level (R) 
 Very Low (1 to 2) 
 Low (3 to 5) 
 Moderate (6 to 11) 
 High (12 to 19) 
 Very High (20 to 25) 
 Very 
high 
initial 
risks 
are 
considered 
to 
be 
unacceptable 
and 
require 
corrective 
action 
well 
in 
 advance of project 
development. 
In short, 
measures must be 
applied to reduce 
very high initial 
risks 
 to a tolerable level. 

 As 
shown 
and 
discussed 
above, 
after 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
operational, 
technical, 
and 
 administrative actions that have been 
applied or 
are available for action 
when required, the 
residual 
 risk can be determined. 
The residual risk provides 
a basis for the 
management team to 
determine 
 if the residual risk 
level is acceptable or tolerable. 
If the risk level 
is determined to be unacceptable, 
 further actions should be considered to reduce the residual risk to acceptable or tolerable 
levels to 
 provide justification for continuation 
of the proposed operation.

 Description of the Coal Property 
 The Logan Mine Complex Logan) is located in Logan, Boone, and Wyoming Counties, West 
Virginia 
 is an 
active operation 
with four 
underground 
mines and 
one surface 
mine. 
Active underground 
 operations within the Logan Mine Complex all utilize continuous mining production sections. 
Large 
 mining operations are conducted 
at the 
Muddy Bridge, Eagle 
No. 1 
Mine and Lower 
War Eagle Mine. 

 Coronado 
also operates 
a single 
section active 
underground 
room-and-pillar section 
in the 
North 
 Fork 
Winifrede 
Mine. 
Other 
operations 
are 
projected 
on 
relatively 
small 
reserve 
blocks 
to 
be 
 developed 
sequentially 
to 
sustain 
production 
levels 
as 
each 
reserve 
is 
depleted.

 provides continuity, 
preserving skilled work groups 
and enabling effective 
utilization of production 
 equipment. 
Mines located 
above drainage 
have access 
via drift 
entries. 
A few 
of the 
coal seams 
 are below drainage and are accessed with slopes and shafts or box cuts. 
 The Logan 
Mine Complex 
also includes 
one active 
surface mine 
(Toney 
Fork) and 
one idle 
surface 
 mine (Elklick). 
Both area and contour 
surface mining are employed. 
Highwall mining is conducted 
 by contract 
operators. 
The 
surface 
operations 
are 
relatively 
small and 
developed 
sequentially to 
 sustain production 
levels. 
Similar to the 
underground operations, 
the method provides 
continuity 
 while 
preserving 
skilled 
work 
groups 
and 
enabling 
effective 
utilization 
of 
production 
equipment. 

 The surface mining methods selected utilize hydraulic shovels, front-end loaders, large tractors and 
 rock trucks for overburden removal.

 Summary of Residual Risk Ratings 
 Each 
risk factor 
is numbered, 
and 
a 
risk level 
for 
each 
is determined 
by 
multiplying 
the 
assigned 
 probability by 
the assigned 
consequence. 
The risk 
levels are 
plotted 
on a 
risk matrix 
to provide 
a 
 composite 
view 
of 
the 
Coronado 
risk 
profile. 
The

 22.2.8.1
 Geological and Coal Resource 
 Coal 
mining 
is 
accompanied 
by 
risk 
that, 
despite 
exploration 
efforts, 
mining 
areas 
will 
be 
 encountered 
where geological 
conditions render 
extraction 
of the 
resource to 
be uneconomic, 
or 
 that coal quality characteristics disqualify the product for sale into 
target markets. 
 Offsetting the geological and 
coal resource risk 
are the massive 
size of the 
controlled property which 
 allows large areas to be mined sufficiently away from 
areas where coal quality and mineability may 
 be 
less 
favorable. 
In 
addition, 
several 
mines 
are 
designed 
to 
operate 
with 
multiple 
production 
 sections, which lessens 
the immediate 
impact when one section 
encounters difficulties. 
The large 
 reserve areas also provide 
a mitigation strategy 
of developing an additional (spare) section 
at each 
 mine, 
or 
additional 
mines, 
which 
can 
be 
activated 
when 
adverse 
conditions 
are 
encountered, 
 thereby 
maintaining 
consistent 
production 
and 
quality. 
The 
spare 
section 
or 
mines 
require 
 additional mine extension cost but increase flexibility and performance consistency. 
 The 
larger 
reserve 
areas 
will 
be 
developed 
with 
multiple 
production 
sections 
and 
the 
small, 
 replacement production reserve areas 
provide ready access 
to alternative locations if 
geological and 
 coal resource characteristics require 
abandonment of an active production area.

 Mining Plan 
 Occupational health and 
safety risks are inherent 
in mining 
operations. 
Comprehensive training and 
 retraining 
programs, 
internal 
safety 
audits 
and 
examinations, 
regular 
mine 
inspections, 
safety 
 meetings, along 
with support 
of trained 
fire brigades 
and mine 
rescue teams 
are among 
activities 
 that 
greatly 
reduce 
accident 
risks. 
Employee 
health monitoring 
programs 
coupled 
with dust 
and 
 noise monitoring and abatement reduce health risks to miners. 

 As 
underground 
and 
surface 
mines 
are 
developed 
and 
extended, 
observation 
of 
geological, 
 hydrogeological and geotechnical conditions leads to modification of mine plans and procedures to 
 enable safe work within the mine environments. 
 Highlighted 
below 
are 
selected 
examples 
of 
safety 
and 
external 
factors 
relevant 
to 
Coronado 
 operations. 
 22.2.8.5.1
 Methane Management 
 Coalbed methane is 
present in coal 
operations below 
drainage. 
Often the methane 
concentration 
 in shallow coal seams is at such low levels that it can be readily managed with frequent testing 
and 
 monitoring, 
vigilance 
and 
routine 
mine 
ventilation. 
Very 
high 
methane 
concentrations 
may 
be 
 present 
at 
greater 
depths. 
High

 Mine Fires 
 Mine 
fires, 
once 
common 
at 
mine operations, 
are 
rare 
today. 
Most 
active 
coal 
miners 
have 
not 
 encountered a mine 
fire. 
Vastly improved mine power and 
equipment electrical systems, along 
with 
 safe 
mine 
practices 
reduce 
mine 
fire 
risks. 
Crew 
training 
and 
fire 
brigade 
support 
and 
training 
 improve response for containment and 
control if a 
fire occurs. 
Spontaneous combustion within coal 
 mines, which is the source of most fires that occur today, is not expected to commonly occur at the 
 Logan 
property. 
When spontaneous 
combustion 
conditions 
are 
present, 
monitoring 
systems 
are 
 employed for 
early detection 
and mine plans 
are designed to 
facilitate 
isolation, containment 
and 
 rapid extinguishment.

highwall 
failure. 
The 
highwall 
can 
be 
designed 
to 
incorporate 
safety 
 precautions to address geotechnical and hydrogeological concerns. 
Drilling and blasting design can 
 be modified to 
fit soil and 
strata 
conditions to 
enhance highwall stability. 
Foremen and 
crews are 
 trained to examine the highwalls frequently to observe changes and indications of failure. 
Highwall 
 designs incorporate adequate web thickness and safety 
pillar width to assure highwall stability.

This will require the concurrent collection and storage 
 of preliminary economic, mining, metallurgical, environmental, 
legal and 
 social data and other information for use in the estimation 
of MRMR. 

 The Resource Database will include both primary (observation and

 Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data 
 Criteria
 JORC Code explanation
 Commentary
 Sampling techniques 
 > 
 Nature and quality of sampling (e.g. cut channels, random chips, or specific specialised 
 industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such as 
 downhole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc.). These examples should not be taken 
 as limiting the broad meaning of sampling. 
 > 
 Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the 
 appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used. 
 > 
 Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the Public Report. In 
 cases where industry standard work has been done this would be relatively simple (e.g. reverse 
 circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 
 g charge for fire assay ). In other cases, more explanation may be required, such 
as where there is 
 coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation 
types 
 (e.g. submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information. 
 > 
 Most of the coal samples have been obtained from the Properties by subsurface exploration 
 using core drilling techniques. 
The protocol for preparing and testing the samples has varied over time 
 and is not well documented for the older holes drilled on the Properties. 
 > 
 Typical USA core drilling sampling technique is for the coal core sample, once recovered from 
 the core barrel, to be described then wrapped in a sealed plastic sleeve and placed into a covered core 
 box, which is the length of the sample so that the core can be delivered to a laboratory in relatively 
 intact condition and with original moisture content. 
 > 
 It is reasonable to assume, given the sophistication level of the previous operators, that 
 these samples were generally collected and processed under industry best-practices. 
This assumption is 
 based on MM A s familiarity with the operating companies and the companies used to perform the 
 analysis. 

 > 
 Some of the drill holes were air rotary bored and no coal core samples were collected. 
Seam 
 thickness for rotary-drilled bore holes is verified by calibrated downhole gamma-density logs. 

 > 
 Coal samples that were deemed by MM A geologists to be unrepresentative were not used 
 for statistical analysis of coal quality, as documented in the tabulations. A representative group of drill 
 hole samples from the Properties were then checked against the original drill laboratory reports to 
 verify accuracy and correctness. 

 Drilling techniques 
 > 
 Drill type (e.g. core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, 
 Bangka, sonic, etc.) and details (e.g. core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, 
 face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc.). 
 > 
 The Properties have been extensively explored by subsurface drilling efforts carried out by 
 numerous entities, most of which were completed prior to acquisition by Coronado. 
The majority of the 
 drilling was accomplished using vertical continuous (diamond) coring or air rotary methods. 
 > 
 Core drilling methods utilize NX-size (5.4 centimeter) or similar-sized core cylinders to 
 recover core samples, which can be used to delineate geologic characteristics, and for coal quality 
 testing and geotechnical logging. 

 > 
 Data for the rotary drilled holes is mainly derived from downhole geophysical logs, which are 
 used to interpret coal and rock thickness and depth since logging of the drill cuttings is not reliable. 
 > 
 Geophysical logging was performed on many of the holes, either by Geological Logging 
 Systems (a division of MM A), other geophysical logging contractors, and on those properties acquired 
 from CONSOL geophysical logging was often performed by CONSOL s in-house logging services. 
 Drill sample recovery 
 > 
 Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and results 
 assessed. 
 > 
 Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure representative nature of the 
 samples. 
 > 
 Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and whether sample 
 bias may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material. 
 > 
 Where available, core recovery thickness of coal samples was reconciled with the thickness 
 interpreted from geophysical logs. 
 > 
 Core recovery of the older coal samples lacking geophysical logs is sometimes not well-
 documented: however, when the laboratory results for such holes had anomalous values, the data was 
 disqualified and not used.

 Logging 
 > 
 Whether core and chip samples have been geologically and geotechnically logged to a 
 level of detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies and 
 metallurgical studies. 
 > 
 Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature. Core (or costean, channel, etc.) 
 photography. 
 > 
 The total length and percentage of the relevant intersections logged. 
 > 
 A wide variety of core-logging techniques exist for the properties. 
For many of the core 
 holes, the primary data source is a generalized lithology description by the driller, in some cases 
 supplemented by a more detailed core log completed by a geologist. 

 > 
 The logging of core thickness and depth is quantitative. 
With the exception of the coal 
 seams, logging of rock strata type is more subjective and best considered as qualitative. 
 Sub-sampling 
 techniques and sample 
 preparation 
 > 
 If core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, half or all core taken. 
 > 
 If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split, etc. and whether sampled wet 
 or dry. 
 > 
 For all sample types, the nature, quality and appropriateness of the sample preparation 
 technique. 
 > 
 Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-sampling stages to maximise 
 representivity of samples. 
 > 
 Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is representative of the in situ material 
 collected, including for instance results for field duplicate/second-half sampling. 
 > 
 Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the material being sampled. 
 > 
 Typical US practice in the Appalachian Basin is that core samples for deep mineable core 
 samples are not sawn or subsampled (since seams are not of great thickness and the entire seam is 
 mined and co-mingled). 
 > 
 Oftentimes, core for surface-mineable coal seams are bench sampled separately by the 
 various coal and rock layers (plies). 
 > 
 MM A has exercised diligence to use only those analyses that are representative of the coal 
 quality parameters for the appropriate mining type for each sample. 
 Quality of assay data 
 and laboratory tests 
 > 
 The nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and laboratory procedures 
 used and whether the technique is considered partial or total. 
 > 
 For geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld XRF instruments, etc., the parameters 
 used in determining the analysis including instrument make and model, reading times, calibrations 
 factors applied and their derivation, etc. 
 > 
 Nature of quality control procedures adopted (e.g. standards, blanks, duplicates, 
 external laboratory checks) and whether acceptable levels of accuracy (i.e. lack of bias) and 
 precision have been established. 
 > 
 Sample analysis was typically carried out by accredited US laboratories. 

 > 
 Standard procedure upon receipt of core samples by the testing laboratory is to log the 
 depth and thickness of the sample, then perform testing as specified by a representative of the 
 operating company. 
Each sample is then analyzed in accordance with procedures defined under 
 ASTM 
 International ASTM)
 
standards including, but not limited to; washability (ASTM D4371); ash (ASTM 
 D3174); sulfur (ASTM D4239); Btu/lb. (ASTM D5865); volatile matter (ASTM D3175); Free Swell Index 
 FSI) (ASTM D720). 
 > 
 Geophysical tools are calibrated by the logging company and where possible, validated using 
 a calibration hole. 
 Verification of 
 sampling and assaying 
 > 
 The verification of significant intersections by either independent or alternative 
 company personnel. 
 > 
 The use of twinned holes. 
 > 
 Documentation of primary data, data entry procedures, data verification, data storage 
 (physical and electronic) protocols. 
 > 
 Discuss any adjustment to assay data.

 All coal intersection data used to generate the geologic model has been cross referenced 
 with the lithological and geophysical logs by MM A. 
 > 
 Laboratory quality was adjusted from dry basis to reflect the anticipated marketable product 
 moisture. 
 > 
 Coal quality results were verified by spot-check with laboratory analysis sheets by MM A 
 before inclusion into the geologic model and use in the resource estimate.

 Location of data points 
 > 
 Accuracy and quality of surveys used to locate drill holes (collar and down-hole 
 surveys), trenches, mine workings and other locations used in Mineral Resource estimation. 
 > 
 Specification of the grid system used. 
 > 
 Quality and adequacy of topographic control. 
 > 
 Due to the long history of exploration by various parties on the Properties, a wide variety of 
 survey techniques exist for documentation of data point locations. 
Many of the older exploration drill 
 holes appear to have been located by ground survey; more recently completed drill holes are often 
 located by high-resolution Global Positioning System GPS) units. 
 > 
 Grid systems used are typically the State Plane Coordinate System pertinent to each 
 property. 

 > 
 Topography is based on either the USGS topographic 7.5-minute quadrangle maps or on 
 recent aerial photogrammetry as necessary (subject to availability). 
 Data spacing and 
 distribution 
 > 
 Data spacing for reporting of Exploration Results. 
 > 
 Whether the data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish the degree of 
 geological and grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve 
 estimation procedure(s) and classifications applied. 
 > 
 Whether sample compositing has been applied. 
 > 
 Spacing and distribution of data point information may vary from seam to seam within each 
 mining area. 
The areas estimated for coal resource and coal reserve tonnes have been limited so that 
 the data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish the degree of geological continuity 
 appropriate for the estimation and classification of the coal tonnes. 

 > 
 All of the coal resource tonnes are in the measured, indicated, and inferred categories, and 
 all of the coal reserve tonnes are in the proved and probable categories in accordance with the JORC 
 Code and SEC standards. 

 Orientation of data in 
 relation to geological 
 structure 
 > 
 Whether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of possible structures 
 and the extent to which this is known, considering the deposit type. 
 > 
 If the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation of key 
 mineralised structures is considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this should be assessed 
 and reported if material. 
 > 
 Drill holes have been vertically drilled. 
No downhole deviation logs have been collected and 
 it is therefore not known if the drill holes have deviated away from vertical. 
Based on the relatively 
 shallow seam depths, any deviation is expected to be insignificant and immaterial to the geologic 
 characterization of the Property. 
 > 
 The dip of the coal seams is relatively minor and not a material issue for representation of 
 seam thickness or quality. 
 Sample security 
 The measures taken to ensure sample security. 
 > 
 Sample handling procedures employed by explorationists follow typical US protocol and 
 should be adequate to insure sample security. 
 Audits or reviews 
 The results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques and data. 
 > 
 MM A has reviewed all available geological information for the Properties in developing the 
 geologic model. 
Only that data deemed suitable has been used for the purpose of generating the 
 resource and reserve estimates.

 MM A has not carried out separate title verification for the coal properties and has not 
 verified leases, deeds, surveys or other property control instruments pertinent to the subject resources. 

 > 
 Coronado has represented to MM A that it controls the mining rights to the coal deposits as 
 shown on its property maps, and MM A has accepted these as being a true and accurate depiction of 
 the mineral rights controlled by Coronado. 
The TRS assumes the properties are developed under 
 responsible and experienced management.

 collar 
 
 dip and azimuth of the hole 
 
 down hole length and interception depth 
 
 hole length.

 If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is not 
 Material and this exclusion does not detract from the understanding of the report, the Competent 
 Person should clearly explain why this is the case.

 MM A reviewed and entered all pertinent data into a digital geologic database for each 
 Coronado property. 
The database consists of thousands of data records, which include drill hole and 
 supplemental coal seam thickness measurements from outcrop and mine exposures.

 Data aggregation 
 methods 
 > 
 In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or 
 minimum grade truncations (e.g. cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material 
 and should be stated. 
 > 
 Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high grade results and longer 
 lengths of low grade results, the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and some 
 typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail. 
 > 
 The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should be clearly 
 stated. 
 > 
 Where a coal seam has been bench sampled (typically for surface mining) the individual 
 analyses for the coal plies are normally weight-averaged to represent the total of recoverable coal. 
 > 
 Coal quality summary results have been documented in the TRS. 
Average coal quality on a 
 per-seam basis is used to represent the coal resources within a given mining area. 
 > 
 Average coal quality for each Coronado complex is provided in Tables 1-1, 1-2 and 1-3 of this 
 TRS. 

 > 
 No other data aggregations methods are used. 
 Relationship between 
 mineralisation widths 
 and intercept lengths 
 > 
 These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration Results. 
 > 
 If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole angle is known, its 
 nature should be reported. 
 > 
 If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a clear 
 statement to this effect (e.g. down hole length, true width not known ). 
 > 
 Coal thickness values from all coal intersections and down hole geophysical logs are 
 considered to be vertical thicknesses. 
Seam dip of approximately 2.0 to 3.0 degrees has little effect on 
 the vertical thickness of the seam. 
 Diagrams 
 > 
 Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be 
 included for any significant discovery being reported These should include, but not be limited to a 
 plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views. 
 > 
 Diagrams and maps showing the coal seam intercepts are presented in the TRS. 
 Balanced reporting 
 > 
 Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, 
 representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to avoid 
 misleading reporting of Exploration Results. 
 > 
 All of the available, qualified exploration data has been included within the tabulations, 
 maps, and diagrams for this TRS. 
 > 
 Both coal thickness and quality data are deemed by MM A to be reasonably sufficient within 
 the resource areas. Therefore, there is a reasonable level of confidence in the geologic interpretations 
 required for coal resource determination based on the available data and the techniques applied to the 
 data. 
 Other substantive 
 exploration data 
 > 
 Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but 
 not limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; 
 bulk samples size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density, 
 groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating 
 substances. 
 > 
 Informational material available from the U.S. Geological Survey and the respective State 
 Surveys was used to assist in the Resource estimate. 

 Further work

 The factors affecting continuity both of grade and geology. 
 > 
 Due to the relative structural simplicity of the deposits and the reasonable continuity of the 
 tabular coal beds, the principal geological interpretation necessary to define the geometry of the coal 
 deposits is the proper modeling of their thickness and elevation. 

 > 
 Both coal thickness and quality data are deemed by MM A to be reasonable within the

 These cut-off parameters have been developed by MM A based on its experience with the 
 Coronado properties and other mining operations of the Central Appalachian coal basin. 
This experience 
 includes technical and economic evaluations of numerous properties in the region for the purposes of 
 determining the economic viability of the subject coal reserves. 
 Mining factors or 
 assumptions 
 > 
 Assumptions made regarding possible mining methods, minimum mining dimensions and 
 internal (or, if applicable, external) mining dilution. It is always necessary as part of the process of 
 determining reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction to consider potential mining 
 methods, but the assumptions made regarding mining methods and parameters when estimating 
 Mineral Resources may not always be rigorous. Where this is the case, this should be reported with 
 an explanation of the basis of the mining assumptions made. 
 > 
 Mining factors such as dilution, mining and washing recovery are variable and have been 
 applied at the coal deposits at each operation based on site-specific characteristics. 
 > 
 Details of the factors are cited within the TRS. 
 > 
 Factors that would typically preclude conversion of a coal resource to coal reserve include the 
 following: inferred resource classification; absence of coal quality; poor mine recovery; lack of access; 
 insufficient exploration; or uncontrolled surface property for areas of proposed for surface mining. 

 > 
 While such factors were used to preclude the conversion of a very limited number of coal 
 resources to coal reserves in this report, the extensive history of mining on the Properties would suggest 
 that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extractions of all coal resources under 
 favorable market conditions. 
 Metallurgical factors 
or 
 assumptions 
 > 
 The basis for assumptions or predictions regarding metallurgical amenability. It is always 
 necessary as part of the process of determining reasonable prospects for eventual economic 
 extraction to consider potential metallurgical methods, but the assumptions regarding metallurgical 
 treatment processes and parameters made when reporting Mineral Resources may not always be 
 rigorous. Where this is the case, this should be reported with an explanation of the basis of the 
 metallurgical assumptions made. 
 > 
 The products mined from coal resources controlled by Coronado can be sold into high-, mid-, 
 and low-volatile metallurgical coal markets because of their inherent quality characteristics. 

 > 
 Run-of-mine production is washed at the coal preparation plants as needed for quality control. 

 > 
 Coronado may blend production from multiple sources to manage ash and sulfur content along 
 with the rheological and petrographic characteristics of the shipped products. 

 Environmental factors 
or 
 assumptions 
 > 
 Assumptions made regarding possible waste and process residue disposal options. It is 
 always necessary as part of the process of determining reasonable prospects for eventual economic 
 extraction to consider the potential environmental impacts of the mining and processing operation. 

 While at this stage the determination of potential environmental impacts, particularly for a 
 greenfields project, may not always be well advanced, the status of early consideration of these 
 potential environmental impacts should be reported. Where these aspects have not been considered 
 this should be reported with an explanation of the environmental assumptions made.

 The room-and-pillar mining method was selected to model the underground mining resources, 
 utilizing continuous miners for coal extraction, shuttle cars for production section haulage and roof 
 bolters for roof control, with the exception that the Buchanan Mine also uses longwall shearers, 
 armored face conveyors, and hydraulic self-advancing roof support. 
The resource areas located above 
 drainage are relatively small and often have irregular boundaries.
 The Buchanan Mine in Buchanan 
 County, Virginia is the only active longwall mine currently being operated by Coronado. 
 > 
 The Coronado underground mining resource areas which are located above-drainage require an 
 access road and mine access development along the outcrop, whereas below-drainage mines are 
 accessed via shaft or slope based on other proposed surface infrastructure locations and/or surface 
 property control.

 The surface mining method selected utilizes highly productive hydraulic shovels, front-end loaders, 
 large tractors and rock trucks for overburden removal. 
The mobile equipment spreads adapt readily to 
 winding coal outcrops for contour surface mining and are effective for point-removal

No mining is projected when the interval between overlying and underlying reserves is less than 
 12 meters. 
 > 
 Surface Mining Resources: 
For classification as a surface-mineable resource, a seam must be at 
 least 0.3 meters in thickness as a stand-alone (principle) seam and 0.15 meters in thickness when less 
 than 0.8 meters from a principal seam. 
The maximum cumulative area mining strip ratio is generally 
 20:1 for thermal coal and 30:1 for metallurgical coal. 
Some areas were assessed for their economic 
 viability at higher ratios, and were included as reserves if deemed economic. 
For contour surface 
 mining, a minimum of 38-meter bench is provided to support HWM. 
 > 
 HWM and Auger Mining Resources: HWM cut depth (penetration) is established at a maximum of 
 244 meters. 
The minimum mineable coal thickness is limited at 0.6 meters. For coal seams less than 
 0.8 meters thick, roof and/or floor characteristics must allow OSD cutting to maintain a 0.8-meter 
 minimum cutting height.
 Auger mining cut depth is established at an average of 91 meters. 
The 
 minimum mineable coal thickness is limited at 0.5 meters.

 Underground Mining Reserves: 
The planning model assigns minimum mining heights of 1.4 to 1.8 
 meters for mains and panel development. 
At the Buchanan Mine, a minimum mining height of 1.8 
 meters was used due to the longwall mining method being employed. 
For coal seams thinner than the 
 assigned mining height, the difference between the coal seam height and assigned mining height 
 consists of OSD. 
In all cases a minimum of 0.05 meters of OSD was assumed, with the exception of the 
 Mon Valley mines, where a minimum 0.15 meters of OSD was assumed due to weaker floor strata. 
 > 
 Surface Mining Reserves: 
Area mining is generally limited to a cumulative overburden ratio of 30:1 
 and a 15:1 ratio for contour mining. 
Exceptions were considered for mining of metallurgical grade coal 
 where deemed economical. 
It is assumed that careful cleaning of exposed coal pits will result in 
 minimal OSD. 
 > 
 HWM and Auger Mining Reserves: 
The mining plan assumes that the HWM cutting height is a 
 minimum of 76 to 99 centimeters for clearance purposes. 
When the coal seam is less than 76 to 99 
 centimeters thick, OSD assumed and included in the ROM product.
 Because the auger has very limited 
 OSD cutting ability, it is assumed that an appropriate auger diameter will be chosen based on the coal 
 seam thickness and that OSD will be minimal.

 Underground Mining Reserves: 
Mine recovery generally varies between 40 and 60 percent for 
 continuous mining panels, and 100 percent for longwall.

 Surface Mining Reserves: 
Mining recovery is 90 percent for virgin areas. 
Mining recovery is 
 reduced where second mining is projected in previously underground and auger mined areas.

 Underground Mining Resources: 
The continuous mining method provides for the extraction of 
 coal from the production faces using continuous miners (and longwall shearing machine at Buchanan) 
 and haulage using shuttle cars or battery haulers to a feeder-breaker located at the tail of the section 
 conveyor belt. 
The feeder-breaker crushes large pieces of coal and rock and regulates coal feed onto 
 the mine conveyor. 
A chain conveyor is used to remove coal from the longwall face at the Buchanan 
 Mine for placement onto the conveyor belt which is ultimately delivered to an underground storage 
 bunker. 
Roof-bolting machines are used to install roof bolts, and battery scoops are available to clean 
 the mine entries and assist in delivery of mine supplies to work areas. 
Surface ventilation fans are 
 installed as needed to provide a sufficient volume of air to ventilate production sections, coal haulage 
 and transport entries, battery charging stations, and transformers in accordance with approved plans. 
 > 
 Coronado currently operates three coal preparation plants, one each at the Buchanan, Logan 
 County and Greenbrier Divisions. 
The Buchanan Plant operates at a feed rate of approximately 907 raw 
 tonnes per hour tph), whereas the Saunders Plant (Logan County Division) has a nominal feed rate of 
 816 tph, and the Mountaineer Plant (Greenbrier Division) operates at 544 tph.
 MM A has included 
 capital estimates for construction of additional coal preparation plants at the Russell County and Mon 
 Valley Complex for the purposes of this TRS.

 Surface Mining Resources: The surface mining mobile equipment spreads advance the contour and 
 area mining pits while systematically reclaiming the trailing side of pits where coal has been removed. 

 The coal haul roads are extended and maintained as the pits advance. 
Support facilities are maintained 
 nearby but away from the active mining, and include storage areas for blasting agents, fuel and 
 lubricants, and mine supplies along with maintenance facilities and offices. 
Most of the surface mine 
 production is transported to a loading point for crushing, blending and direct-shipment to customers. 

 > 
 HWM and Auger Resources: The HWM equipment advances along with the contour mining pits. 

 The rate of advance of the contour mining is governed by the advancement rate of the HWM. 
A diesel-
 powered generator trails the highwall miner and powers the continuous mining unit. 
Other support 
 facilities are provided along with the contour mining support facilities.

 Coronado provided historical and 5-year budget operating costs for its active mines for MM A s 
 review. 
MM A used the historical and/or budget cost information as a reference and developed 
 personnel schedules for each mine. 
Hourly labor rates and salaries were based upon information 
 contained in Coronado s financial summaries. 
Fringe benefit costs were developed for vacation and 
 holidays, federal and state unemployment insurance, retirement, workers compensation and 
 pneumoconiosis, casualty and life insurance, healthcare and bonuses. 
A cost factor for mine supplies 
 was developed that relates expenditures to mine advance rates for roof control costs and other mine 
 supply costs at underground mines. 
Other factors were developed for maintenance and repair costs, 
 rentals, mine power, outside services and other direct mining costs. 
 > 
 Surface mine direct operating costs were developed as a function of overburden ratio for repair 
 and maintenance supplies, diesel fuel, explosives and blasting, and miscellaneous supplies and 
services. 

 Operating costs for highwall mines are based on costs per ROM tonne estimates. 
Other cost factors 
 were developed for coal preparation plant processing, refuse handling, coal loading, trucking, property 
 taxes, and insurance and bonding. 
Appropriate royalty rates were assigned for production from leased 
 coal lands and sales taxes were calculated for state severance taxes, 
the federal black lung excise tax, 
 and federal and state reclamation fees.

 For example, the application of statistical or geostatistical procedures to quantify the relative

 The statement should specify whether it relates to global or local estimates, and, if local, 
 state the relevant tonnages, which should be relevant to technical and economic evaluation. 
 Documentation should include assumptions made and the procedures used.

 Proved and probable coal reserve were derived from the defined in-situ coal resource considering 
 relevant processing, economic (including independent estimates of capital, revenue and cost), 
 marketing, legal, environmental, socioeconomic, and regulatory factors on a global scale as current 
 local data reflects the global assumptions. 
 > 
 Accuracy and confidence discussions should extend to specific discussions of any applied 
 Modifying Factors that may have a material impact on Ore Reserve viability, or for which there 
 are remaining areas of uncertainty at the current study stage. 
 The major risk factors for the active Coronado mines and future resource development are summarized 
 below: 
 > 
 Mine Accidents 
 > 
 Highwall Failure. 
Highwall failures are likely to result in a temporary mine closure and should not 
 have a material impact on the mine sustainability. 
The risk is considered to be probable. 

 > 
 Adverse Geological Conditions. 
Adverse geological conditions include such conditions as faults and 
 sandstone washouts. 
The risk is considered to be probable. 
The impact is expected to be temporary 
 with little material impact on mine sustainability. 
 > 
 Environmental Risk. 
Numerous federal and state permits are required to operate coal mines and 
 mine surface facilities. Permitting rules are complex and may change over time, making compliance 
 difficult or impossible. 
 > 
 Water Quality. 
Permit requirements to fulfill Clean Water Act obligations are subject to 
 modification. 
The probability of water quality changes having a material impact on mine operations is 
 possible. 
As a contemporary example, the selenium discharge issue that affects western Canadian and 
 Central Appalachian Basin operators has only recently emerged as a concern and its ultimate impact 
 has not been determined. 
 > 
 New Permits. 
Permit protests by environmental groups and individuals can contribute to permit 
 delays or denial and increase the cost of permitting and delay development. 
Surface mining activities, 
 coal refuse disposal and construction of access roads in mountainous terrain often require storage of 
 material in valley fills. 
Authority to dispose of fill material into waters of the United States must be 
 granted by the 
 United States Army Corps of Engineers COE)
 . 
COE permits are increasingly difficult to 
 obtain. 
 > 
 Regulatory Requirements. 
Adverse impact from regulatory changes is considered to be probable. 

 The impact will likely affect the broader industry and is not expected to result in mine closure. 
 > 
 Market Risk. 
Metallurgical and thermal coal markets ultimately depend upon the global steel and 
 thermal coal demand and are considered to be volatile. 
Currently, the US coal market has seen a 
 decline in demand for thermal coal due to thermal plant closures, as a result of new air and water 
 pollution regulations, and competition from other commodities used for power generation such as 
 natural gas. 
This has resulted in an overall decline in CAPP coal production. 
Continued regulatory 
 changes and declining demand could result in material changes in domestic and global coal markets. 

 The impact cannot be predicted at this time; however, while MM A expects the coal reserve within 
 this TRS to remain economically viable throughout the life of the projected mines, the LOM financial 
 model is very sensitive to changes in coal sales price and therefore market risk is not insignificant.

 > 
 Labor Risk. 
Work stoppage due to organized labor protests is considered to be unlikely and not 
 likely to lead to permanent mine closure. 
The mines are likely to suffer the loss of key supervisors and 
 skilled employees due to retirement as the workforce ages. 
The problem is industry-wide and the 
 impact is expected to be temporary and have no sustained impact on coal production. 
 > 
 Availability of Equipment and Supplies. 
Risk of equipment and supply availability is likely to be 
 temporary and should not have a sustained adverse impact on the production of coal. 
 > 
 Transportation Delay. 
Interruption of coal transport services by river or rail is considered to be 
 probable but unlikely to have a sustained impact on coal production. 
 > 
 It is recognised that this may not be possible or appropriate in all circumstances. These 
 statements of relative accuracy and confidence of the estimate should be compared with 
 production data, where available. 
 > 
 Mine plans, productivity expectations and cost estimates generally reflect historical performance 
 and efforts have been made to adjust plans and costs to reflect future conditions.

 Executive Summary 
 1.1
 Property Description 
 Coronado Global Resources 
Inc. Coronado) 
 authorized 
 Marshall Miller 
Associates, Inc. MM A) 
 to prepare this Technical Report Summary TRS) of its controlled coal 
resources and reserves for the 
 Mon Valley 
Complex in southwestern 
Pennsylvania (Mon 
Valley 
or the 
 Property). 
An updated 
TRS 
 was 
prepared 
in February 
2023 
due to 
material 
differences 
in the 
key 
financial modifying 
factors 
 including coal 
sales price 
assumptions, operating 
costs and 
capital costs 
from December 
31, 2021 
 to December 31, 2022. 
Coal sales price assumptions are discussed in
 
Sections 12 and 16
 
of the TRS, 
 while operating 
costs and 
capital costs 
are discussed 
in 
 Sections 18 and 
19
 
of the TRS. 
The report 
 provides 
a 
statement 
of 
coal 
resources 
and 
coal 
reserves 
for 
Coronado, 
as 
defined 
under 
the 
 Australasian Code for 
Reporting of Exploration 
Results, Mineral Resources 
and Ore 
Reserves
 JORC 
 Code) as 
well as 
under Subpart 
1300 of 
Regulation 
S-K (Regulation 
S-K 1300) 
promulgated 
by the 
 United 
States 
Securities 
and 
Exchange 
Commission SEC)
 .
 
This 
report 
was 
also 
prepared 
in 
 accordance 
with 
the 
 Australasian 
Code 
for 
Public 
Reporting 
of 
Technical 
Assessments 
and 
 Valuations of Mineral Assets 
 VALMIN Code). 
 The Mon 
Valley 
property is 
comprised of 
three separate 
reserve holdings, 
namely, 
the Pangburn, 
 Shaner 
and 
Fallowfield 
proposed 
underground 
mines 
in 
the 
Upper 
Freeport 
seam. 
All 
three 
 respective 
reserve 
areas 
are 
greenfield 
sites 
and 
are 
undeveloped. 
The 
three 
mines 
have 
been 
 projected 
to 
operate 
independently, 
with 
production 
initially 
beginning 
at 
Pangburn. 
Shaner 
is 
 projected 
to 
come 
online 
as 
replacement 
production 
for 
Pangburn, 
and 
Fallowfield 
represents 
 expanded Mon Valley 
production after Pangburn 
is in full production. 
In addition to the individual 
 mine/plant sites, 
a barge 
loading dock on 
the Monongahela 
River adjacent 
to the 
Pangburn site 
is 
 proposed and will 
be used to 
ship clean coal 
for all three 
mines. 
Each mine site 
will include a 
coal 
 preparation plant and all necessary surface facilities. 
 Coal 
resources 
and 
coal 
reserves 
are 
herein 
reported 
in 
metric 
units 
of 
measurement 
and 
are 
 rounded to millions of metric tonnes Mt). 

 The Mon 
Valley 
properties are 
located approximately 
16 kilometers 
to 32 
kilometers southeast 
of 
 Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania 
(see 
 Figure 1-1). 
The property 
is composed 
of 41,615 
total 
hectares, 
of 
 which 1,339 are leased from private landholders under two leases, and 40,276 hectares 
are owned 
 by 
Coronado. 
Subject to 
Coronado s 
exercising 
its 
renewal 
rights thereunder, 
both 
of the 
leases 
 expire upon exhaustion of the relevant 
coal reserves, which is expected to occur in 2100.

 Ownership 
 Mineral rights for 
the Property were 
formerly controlled by 
 Consolidation Coal 
Company CONSOL)
 . 

 Coronado acquired the Mon Valley 
properties from CONSOL in March 2016. 
 1.3
 Geology 
 There are currently no active operations in 
the Mon Valley complex. 
Strata of economic interest for 
 this TRS are of the Pennsylvanian-age Allegheny Formation, and the subject 
Upper Freeport seam is 
 the 
principal 
coal 
seam 
of 
interest 
for 
Coronado. 
The 
Upper 
Freeport 
seam 
has 
been 
mined 
 extensively in the region. 
The seam is situated below drainage throughout the Property and will be 
 accessed by constructed mine shafts and slopes.

 Exploration Status 
 The 
Property 
has 
been 
explored 
extensively, 
largely 
by 
drilling 
using 
continuous 
coring 
method, 
 rotary 
drilling, and 
by downhole 
geophysical 
methods. 
The majority 
of the 
data 
was 
acquired 
or 
 generated 
by previous 
owners of 
the Property. 
These sources 
comprise the 
primary data 
used in 
 the evaluation of the coal resources 
and coal reserves on the Property. 
MM A examined the data 
 available 
for the 
evaluation 
and incorporated 
all pertinent 
information into 
this TRS. 
Where data 
 appeared 
to be 
anomalous or 
not representative, 
that information 
was excluded 
from the 
digital 
 databases and subsequent processing by MM A. 

 Ongoing exploration has been carried out by Coronado since acquiring 
the Mon Valley properties.

no active 
operations 
in the 
Mon Valley 
complex. 
The mines 
will produce 
 coal that is suitable for the high-volatile metallurgical 
coal markets. 
 The 
preliminary 
design 
for 
the 
Pangburn 
mine 
surface 
facilities 
was 
provided 
by 
Coronado. 
The 
 facilities 
include 
offices, 
warehouses, 
shops, 
a 
bathhouse 
for 
personnel, 
a 
preparation 
plant 
to 
 process run-of-mine ROM) coal, a refuse area with a designed capacity 
of approximately 35 million 
 refuse 
tonnes, 
raw 
coal 
storage 
at 
the 
plant 
totaling 
approximately 
100,000 
tonnes, 
clean 
coal 
 storage 
at the 
plant site 
of approximately 
54,000 tonnes, 
and three 
clean coal 
stockpiles adjacent 
 to the 
dock loading facility 
on the Monongahela 
River. 
The three 
river stockpiles 
have a 
designed 
 capacity of 
approximately 
266,000 tonnes. 
Processes are 
expected 
to be 
typical of 
those used 
at 
 operating 
coal-processing plants 
and the 
coal industry 
in general. 
The river 
dock is 
anticipated to 
 also 
support 
production 
from 
the 
planned 
Fallowfield 
and 
Shaner 
operations. 
Room-and-pillar 
 mining will be employed at these properties.

the in-situ resource 
 tonnes 
presented 
in 
 Table

 , 
and 
not 
in 
addition 
to 
coal 
resources. 
Proven 
and 
probable 
coal 
 reserves 
were 
derived 
from 
the 
defined 
coal 
resource 
considering 
relevant 
mining, 
processing,

economic 
(including 
estimates 
of 
capital, 
revenue, 
and 
cost), 
marketing, 
legal, 
 environmental, 
socio-economic 
and regulatory 
factors. 
The 
Resource 
estimate 
has been 
used 
as 
 the basis 
for this Reserve 
calculation, which utilizes 
a reasonable Preliminary 
Feasibility Study, a Life-
 of Mine LOM) Mine Plan and practical recovery factors. 
Production modeling was completed with 
 an effective start date 
of May 1, 2032. 

 Factors 
that 
would 
typically 
preclude 
conversion 
of 
a 
coal 
resource 
to 
coal 
reserve 
include 
the 
 following: 
inferred 
resource 
classification; 
absence 
of 
coal 
quality; 
poor 
mine 
recovery; 
lack 
of 
 access; 
geological 
encumbrances 
associated 
with 
overlying 
and underlying 
strata; 
seam thinning; 
 structural 
complication; 
and 
insufficient 
exploration 
have 
all 
been 
considered. 
Reserve 
 consideration 
excludes 
those 
portions 
of 
the 
resource 
area 
which 
exhibit 
the 
aforementioned 
 geological and operational encumbrances.

Note: Marketable reserve tonnes are reported on a moist basis, including a combination of surface and inherent moisture. 
The combination of 
 surface and inherent moisture is modeled at 6-percent. 
Actual product moisture is dependent upon multiple geological factors, operational 
 factors, and product contract specifications and can exceed 8-percent. 
As such, the modeled moisture values provide a level of conservatism 
 for reserve reporting. 
Life-of-mine sulfur for Pangburn is an estimated 1.21 ; however, overall 
Mon Valley Complex reserve average is 
 1.36 sulfur. 
 In summary, Coronado controls a total of 134.4 
Mt (moist basis) of 
marketable coal reserves at Mon 
 Valley, 
as of December 
31, 2022. 
Of that total, 58 percent are proven, and 
42 percent are probable. 

 There are 133.4 Mt 
of owned coal reserves 
and 1.0 Mt 
of leased coal reserves.

 Capital Summary 
 The 
MM A 
financial 
model 
includes 
provisions 
for 
operating 
equipment 
at 
the 
proposed 
Mon 
 Valley operations. 
MM A s capital schedules assume that major 
equipment rebuilds occur 
over the 
 course 
of 
each 
machine s 
remaining 
assumed 
operating 
life. 
Replacement 
equipment 
was 
 scheduled 
based 
on 
MM A s 
experience 
and 
knowledge 
of 
mining 
equipment 
and 
industry 
 standards with respect to the useful life of 
such equipment. 
A summary of 
the estimated capital for 
 the Property is provided in 
 Figure 1-2
 
below.

 Operating Costs 
 MM A used the Coronado historical and/or budget cost information 
for comparable operations as 
 a reference 
and developed 
personnel 
schedules for 
the mine 
and support 
facilities. 
Hourly labor 
 rates 
and 
salaries 
were 
based 
upon 
information 
contained 
in 
Coronado s 
financial 
summaries. 

 Fringe 
benefit 
costs 
were 
developed 
for 
vacation 
and 
holidays, 
federal 
and 
state 
unemployment 
 insurance, 
retirement, 
workers 
compensation 
and 
pneumoconiosis, 
casualty 
and 
life 
insurance, 
 healthcare, and bonuses. 
A cost factor 
for mine supplies 
was developed that 
relates expenditures 
 to 
mine advance 
rates 
for 
roof 
control 
costs 
and other 
mine supply 
costs 
at underground 
mines. 

 Other 
factors 
were 
developed 
for 
maintenance 
and 
repair 
costs, 
rentals, 
mine 
power, 
outside 
 services and other direct mining costs.

 Economic Evaluation 
 The pre-feasibility financial 
model prepared for 
this TRS 
was developed to 
test the 
economic viability 
 of 
each 
coal 
resource 
area. 
The 
results 
of 
this 
financial 
model 
are 
not 
intended 
to 
represent 
a 
 bankable 
feasibility 
study, 
required 
for 
financing 
of 
any 
current 
or 
future 
mining 
operations 
 contemplated 
for the Coronado 
properties, but are 
intended to establish 
the economic viability 
of 
 the 
estimated 
coal 
reserves. 
Cash 
flows 
are 
simulated 
on 
an 
annual 
basis 
in 
nominal 
dollars 
 assuming a 2 inflation rate based on 
projected production from the coal reserves. 
The discounted 
 cash flow analysis presented herein is based on an effective 
date of January 1, 2023. 

 On an un-levered basis, the net 
present value NPV) of the project cash flow 
after taxes represents 
 the Enterprise 
Value of 
the project. 
The project cash 
flow, 
excluding debt 
service, is calculated 
by 
 subtracting direct 
and indirect 
operating expenses 
and capital 
expenditures from 
revenue. 
Direct 
 costs 
include 
labor, 
operating 
supplies, 
maintenance 
and 
repairs, 
facilities 
costs 
for 
materials 
 handling, 
coal 
preparation, 
refuse 
disposal, 
coal 
loading, 
reclamation 
and 
general 
and 
 administrative costs. 
Indirect costs include statutory and legally agreed 
upon fees related to direct 
 extraction 
of 
the 
mineral. 
The 
indirect 
costs 
are 
the 
Federal 
black 
lung 
tax, 
Federal 
reclamation 
 taxes, property taxes, 
coal production royalties, and income taxes.

 Financial model includes 0.9 million tonnes of inferred coal production. 
Inferred coal represents 0.6 of the total 
 production, and none of this coal was included in the estimate of reserves.
 Consolidated cash flows are driven by annual sales tonnage, which grows from 0.4 million 
tonnes in 
 2032 to a peak of 3.8 
million tonnes in 2060. 
Between years 2061 
and 2090, sales ranges from 
1.5 
 million to 2.7 
million tonnes and between 
years 2091-2100, 
sales range from 
0.4 million tonnes 
to 
 1.3 million tonnes. 
Projected consolidated 
revenue grows 
from 54.0 million 
in 2032 to 
a peak of 
 917.7 million in 2060. 
Revenue totals 37.6 billion for the project s 
life. 
 Consolidated cash flow from operations is positive throughout the projected operating period, with 
 the 
exception 
of post 
-production 
years, 
due to 
end-of-mine 
reclamation 
spending. 
Consolidated 
 cash flow from operations 
peaks at 374.3 million in 
2061 and totals 9.1 billion over 
the project s 
 life. 
Capital 
expenditures 
total 
 531.2 million 
during the 
first 
five 
years 
and 3.8 
billion over 
the 
 project s life. 

 1.10.1
 Discounted Cash Flow Analysis 
 Cash flow after 
tax, but before 
debt service, generated 
over the life 
of the project 
was discounted 
 to NPV 
at a 10.0 
discount rate, 
which represents 
Coronado s 
estimate of 
the nominal dollar, 
risk 
 adjusted 
weighted 
average 
cost 
of 
capital WACC) 
for 
likely 
market 
participants 
if 
the 
subject 
 reserves were offered for sale. 
On an un-levered basis, 
the NPV of 
the project cash 
flows represents 
 the 
Enterprise 
Value 
of 
the 
project 
and 
amounts 
to 
 168.3 
million. 
The 
pre-feasibility 
financial 
 model prepared for the 
TRS was developed to 
test the economic 
viability of 
each coal resource area. 

 The 
NPV 
estimate 
was 
made 
for 
purposes 
of 
confirming 
the 
economics 
for 
classification 
of 
coal 
 reserves and 
not for 
purposes of valuing 
Coronado or 
its Mon Valley 
assets. 
Mine plans were 
not 
 optimized, 
and 
actual 
results 
of 
the 
operations 
may 
be 
different, 
but 
in 
all 
cases, 
the 
mine 
 production plan assumes the properties are under competent management. 
 1.10.2
 Sensitivity Analysis 
 Sensitivity 
of the 
NPV 
results 
to 
changes 
in 
the 
key 
drivers 
is presented 
in the 
chart below. 
The 
 sensitivity study shows 
the NPV at 
the 10.0 discount rate 
when Base Case sales 
prices, operating 
 costs, and capital costs are increased and decreased in increments 
of 5 within a +/- 15 range.

 Permitting 
 Due 
to 
the 
projected 
start-up 
date 
of 
the 
Mon 
Valley 
mines, 
initial-stage 
permit 
work 
has 
been 
 completed 
to date; 
however, 
no permit 
applications have 
been submitted 
to the 
state 
or federal 
 regulatory agencies. 
The proposed mines are 
located in an area with 
a long history of coal 
mining, 
 with 
numerous 
permitted 
operations 
in 
close 
proximity. 
Coal 
mining 
permits 
are 
routinely 
 obtained; a 
2 to 
3-year lead 
time is 
recommended. 
Estimated 
expenditures for 
mine closure 
and 
 site reclamation are included in the financial model for each mine or plant site. 
MM A is unaware 
 of any obvious or 
current Coronado permitting 
issues that are expected 
to prevent the 
issuance of 
 future permits. 
All coal producers are subject to a level of uncertainty regarding future clean water 
 permits due to 
 United States 
Environmental 
Protection Agency
 EPA)
 
and 
 United States 
Fish and 
 Wildlife USFW)
 
involvement with state programs. 
 1.12
 Conclusion and Recommendations 
 Sufficient 
data 
has 
been 
obtained 
through 
various 
exploration, 
sampling 
programs, 
and 
mining 
 operations 
to 
support 
the 
geological 
interpretations 
of 
seam 
structure 
and 
thickness 
for 
coal 
 horizons situated 
on the Property. 
The data are 
of sufficient 
quantity and reliability 
to reasonably 
 support the coal-resource and coal-reserve estimates 
in this TRS.

An updated TRS 
was prepared 
in February 2023 
 due 
to 
material 
differences 
in 
the 
key 
financial 
modifying 
factors 
including 
coal 
sales 
price 
 assumptions, operating costs 
and capital costs 
from December 31, 
2021 to 
December 31, 
2022. 
Coal 
 sales price 
assumptions are 
discussed in
 
Sections 12 
and 16
 
of the 
TRS, while 
operating 
costs and 
 capital costs are discussed in 
 Sections 18 and 
19
 
of the TRS.

 MM A 
reviewed 
the 
provided 
data 
and 
found 
it 
to 
be 
reasonable 
prior 
to 
incorporating 
it 
into 
the 
TRS. 
The 
TRS 
contains 
 forward-looking 
 information including 
forecasts 
of productivity 
and annual 
coal production, 
operating and 
capital cost 
estimates, coals 
sales price 
forecasts, the 
 assumption that 
Coronado 
will 
continue 
to 
acquire 
necessary permits, 
and 
other assumptions. 
The 
TRS 
statements 
and 
conclusions 
are 
not 
a 
 guarantee of future performance and undue reliance should not be placed on them. 
The ability of Coronado to recover the estimated coal reserves 
 is dependent on multiple factors beyond the 
control of MM A including, but not 
limited to geologic factors, mining conditions, regulatory approvals, 
 and changes in regulations. 
In all cases, the plans assume the Property is under competent management.
 Coronado engaged MM A to conduct a coal resource and reserve evaluation 
of the Coronado coal 
 properties 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2022, 
the 
effective 
date 
of 
this 
TRS 
for 
Mon 
Valley. 
For 
the 
 evaluation, the following tasks were 
to be completed:

> 
 Conduct a site visit to the projected resource/reserve area; 
 > 
 Process the information supporting the estimation of 
coal resources and reserves into geological 
 models; 

 > 
 Develop life-of-reserve mine LOM) plans and financial models; 
 > 
 Hold discussions with Coronado company management; and 

 > 
 Prepare and issue a TRS providing a statement 
of coal resources and reserves which would 
 include: 
 -
 A description of the mines and facilities. 

 -
 A description of the evaluation process. 
 -
 An estimation

 Property Description 
 3.1
 Location 
 The Mon Valley 
Complex will include the 
Pangburn, Shaner, 
and Fallowfield underground 
mines in 
 the Upper Freeport coal 
seam. 
The properties are located approximately 22.5 kilometers southeast 
 of Pittsburgh. 

 The 
property 
is 
located 
in 
Allegheny, 
Washington, 
and 
Westmoreland 
Counties, 
Pennsylvania. 

 Mining operations 
here have 
not yet 
been initiated. 
The Property 
is located 
on portions 
of eight 
 United 
States 
Geological 
Survey 
 USGS) 
quadrangles: 
Irwin; 
Glassport; 
Monongahela; 
Donora; 
 Smithton; California; Ellsworth; and Hackett. 
The coordinate system and datum used for the model 
 of 
Mon 
Valley 
and 
the 
subsequent 
maps 
were 
produced 
in 
the 
Pennsylvania 
State 
Plane 
South 
 system, NAD 27. 
 3.2
 Titles, Claims or Leases 
 The 
property 
is 
composed 
of 
41,615 
total 
hectares, 
of 
which 
1,339 
are 
leased 
from 
private 
 landholders under two leases, and 40,276 hectares are owned by Coronado. 
Subject to Coronado s 
 exercising 
its renewal rights 
thereunder, 
both of the leases expire 
upon exhaustion of the 
relevant 
 coal 
reserves, 
which 
is 
expected 
to 
occur 
in 
2100. 
MM A 
has 
not 
carried 
out 
a 
separate 
title 
 verification 
for 
the coal 
properties 
and has 
not verified 
leases, deeds, 
surveys, or 
other property-
 control 
instruments 
pertinent 
to 
the 
subject 
resources. 
Tenure 
was 
separately 
reviewed 
by 
 Coronado s 
legal advisors. 
Coronado has 
represented 
to MM A 
that it 
controls the 
mining rights 
 to the reserves as shown on 
its property maps, and MM A has accepted 
these as being a true and 
 accurate 
depiction of 
the mineral 
rights controlled 
by Coronado. 
The TRS 
assumes the 
properties 
 are developed under responsible and experienced management. 

 3.3
 Mineral Rights 
 Coronado supplied property control maps to MM A related to properties for which mineral and/or 
 surface 
property 
are 
controlled 
by 
Coronado. 
While 
MM A 
accepted 
these 
representations 
as 
 being 
true 
and 
accurate, 
MM A 
has 
no 
knowledge 
of 
past 
property 
boundary disputes 
or 
other 
 concerns, through 
past knowledge 
of the 
Property, 
that would 
signal concern 
over future 
mining 
 operations or development potential.

 Property control 
in Appalachia can 
be intricate. 
Coal-mining properties 
are typically 
composed of 
 numerous property 
tracts which 
are owned 
and/or leased 
from both 
land-holding companies 
and 
 private 
individuals 
or 
companies. 
It 
is 
common 
to 
encounter 
severed 
ownership, 
with 
different 
 entities 
or individuals 
controlling 
the 
surface 
and mineral 
rights. 
Mineral 
control 
in the 
region 
is 
 typically characterized by leases or ownership of larger tracts of land, 
with surface control generally 
 comprised of smaller tracts, particularly in developed areas. 
 Legal mining rights may reflect a combination of fee or 
mineral ownership and fee or mineral leases 
 of coal lands through various surface and mineral lease agreements. 

 Control 
of 
the 
surface 
property 
is 
necessary 
to 
conduct 
surface 
mining 
but 
is 
not 
necessary 
to 
 conduct underground mining. 
Given that the vicinity of the Mon Valley properties has an extensive 
 history 
of 
coal 
mining, 
Coronado 
and 
its 
predecessors 
have 
a 
successful 
history 
of 
obtaining 
any 
 necessary rights and the associated permits to mine. 
 3.4
 Encumbrances 
 No Title Encumbrances are known. 
By assignment, MM A did 
not complete a query 
related to Title 
 Encumbrances. 

 3.5
 Other Risks 
 There is always risk 
involved in property control. 
Coronado and its predecessor, CONSOL, have both 
 had their legal teams examine the deeds and title control in order to 
minimize the risk.

 Access and Transport 
 There 
is 
general 
access 
to 
the 
Mon 
Valley 
property 
via 
a 
well-developed 
network 
of 
primary, 
 secondary, 
and 
unimproved 
roads. 
The 
Monongahela 
and 
Youghiogheny 
Rivers 
traverse 
the 
 Property from 
south to north. 
There are 
numerous four 
-lane limited-access 
roads situated 
within 
 or adjacent to the Property as well as a network of improved two-lane state and county roads. 
U.S. 
 Interstate 
70 
and 
Pennsylvania 
Route 
51 
traverse 
the 
Fallowfield 
and 
Pangburn 
properties, 
 respectively. 
Numerous 
secondary 
and 
unimproved 
roads 
provide 
direct 
access 
to 
the 
mine 
 property, some being state 
- 
and town- 
maintained. 
These roads typically stay open throughout the 
 year. 
There 
are 
numerous 
transportation/logistical 
options 
for 
shipping 
product. 
The 
primary 
 means 
of 
transport 
for 
produced 
coal 
would 
be 
by 
barge 
on 
the 
Monongahela 
River/Ohio 
River 
 system. 
Additionally, 
a 
CSX 
rail 
line 
located 
along 
the 
banks 
of 
the 
Monongahela 
River 
would 
 provide another option for the shipment of coal.

 Climate and Length of Operating Season 
 The climate of 
the region 
is classified 
as warm-summer 
humid continental with 
four distinct seasons: 

 warm summers, 
cold winters, 
and moderate 
fall and 
spring seasons. 
Precipitation in 
the region 
is 
 consistent throughout the year with the most 
rain falling in spring and 
the early months of 
summer. 

 Average 
yearly rainfall 
is 53.1 centimeters. 
Summer months typically begin 
in late May 
and end in 
 early September 
and range 
in average 
temperature 
from 51 
to 84 
degrees Fahrenheit 
(or 10.6 
to 
 28.9 
degrees 
Celsius). 
Winters 
typically 
begin 
in mid 
to 
late 
November 
and 
run 
until 
mid to 
late 
 March with average temperatures 
ranging from 22 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit 
(or -5.6 to 10 degrees 
 Celsius). 
Precipitation in the winter 
typically comes in 
the form of snowfall 
or as a 
wintery mix (sleet 
 and 
snow) 
with 
severe 
snowfall 
events 
occurring 
occasionally. 
Seasonal 
variations 
in 
climate 
 typically 
do 
not 
affect 
underground 
mining 
in 
Pennsylvania. 
However, 
weather 
events 
could 
 potentially 
negatively 
impact 
efficiency 
of 
surface

preparation 
plant 
operations 
on 
a 
very 
 limited basis, typically lasting less than a few days. 
 4.5
 Infrastructure 
 The Mon Valley property has sources 
of water, 
power, 
personnel, and supplies readily available for 
 use. 
Personnel 
have 
historically 
been 
sourced 
from 
the 
surrounding 
communities 
in 
Allegheny, 
 Washington, and 
Westmoreland Counties, and have 
proven to be adequate 
in numbers to operate 
 the mines. 
As mining is common in the 
surrounding areas, the workforce 
is generally familiar 
with 
 mining practices, and 
many are experienced 
miners. 
Water is 
expected to be 
sourced locally from 
 nearby public 
water sources or 
rivers.

 History 
 5.1
 Previous Operation 
 The 
property 
was 
formerly 
controlled 
by 
 Consolidation 
Coal 
Company 
 CONSOL).

Historic 
 underground 
operations 
were 
active 
in 
the 
area 
in 
the 
early 
1900 s 
and 
contour 
surface 
mining 
 operations 
were 
performed 
in 
the 
1950 
to 
1960 
era.

Coronado 
acquired 
the 
properties 
from 
 CONSOL in March 2016. 
 5.2
 Previous Exploration 
 The 
properties 
have 
been 
extensively 
explored 
by 
subsurface 
drilling 
efforts 
carried 
out 
by 
 numerous entities, 
most of which 
were completed 
prior to acquisition 
by Coronado. 
The majority 
 of the drilling was accomplished 
using vertical continuous (diamond) coring and air 
rotary methods. 
 Drill records 
indicate that 
independent contract 
drilling operators 
have been 
engaged periodically 
 to carry out 
exploration drilling on 
the properties. 
Geophysical logging on 
those properties acquired 
 from CONSOL was often performed by 
both CONSOL s in-house logging services and outside logging 
 firms. 

 6
 Geological Setting, Mineralization and Deposit 
 6.1
 Regional, Local and Property Geology 
 The property lies in the Northern Appalachian 
Coal basin in the Appalachian Plateau 
physiographic 
 province. 
The coal deposits in the eastern USA are the oldest and most extensively 
developed coal 
 deposits in the country. 
The coal deposits on the properties are 
Carboniferous in age, being of 
the 
 Pennsylvanian 
system. 
Overall, 
these 
Carboniferous 
coals 
contain 
roughly 
two-fifths 
of 
the 
 bituminous 
coal 
deposits 
in 
the 
United 
States 
and 
extend 
over 
1,448 
kilometers 
from 
northern 
 Alabama to Pennsylvania and are part of what is known as the 
 Appalachian Basin
 . 
The Appalachian 
 Basin 
is 
more 
than 
402 
kilometers 
wide 
and, 
in 
some 
portions, 
contains 
over 
60 
coal 
seams 
of 
 varying economic significance.

 Seams of economic significance typically range between 0.3 meters to 1.8 meters in thickness, with 
 relatively 
little 
structural 
deformation. 
Regional 
structure 
is 
typically 
characterized 
by 
gently 
 dipping strata to the northwest 
at less than one percent. 
 Seams of the Allegheny Formation have historically been mined in the Pennsylvania region with the 
 Upper 
Freeport 
seam being 
one of 
the principal 
seams in 
the formation. 
Coal from 
the area 
has 
 historically sold in thermal and metallurgical markets. 
 Future 
operations 
at the 
Mon Valley 
properties will 
extract 
the Upper 
Freeport coal 
seam, which 
 covers large areas of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, and West Virginia. 
The Upper Freeport seam is 
 situated 
at 
the 
top 
of 
the 
Allegheny 
Group 
of 
the 
middle 
Pennsylvanian 
period 
(307-315 
million 
 years ago). 
The top of the Upper Freeport 
seam is commonly used as the marker 
between the top 
 of 
the 
Allegheny 
Formation 
and 
the 
overlying 
Upper 
Pennsylvanian 
Conemaugh 
Group. 
The 
 Allegheny Formation is made up of laminated cyclothemic sequences of coal, shale, limestone, and 
 clay. 
The 
Upper 
Freeport 
seam 
lies 
generally 
around 
183 
meters 
below 
the 
Pittsburgh 
seam. 

 Deposits associated with the Upper Freeport are often irregular and dislocated deposits (formed 
in 
 domed peat swamps commonly referred 
to as peat islands ). 

 The 
primary 
structural 
controls 
on 
the 
Upper 
Freeport 
coal 
basin 
are 
localized 
syn-depositional 
 anticlines 
and 
synclines 
that 
directly 
influence 
the 
accumulation 
of 
peat 
bogs. 
These 
structures 
 create 
gently 
folded 
and 
rolling 
coal 
strata. 
The 
axis 
of 
the 
Waynesburg 
and 
Port 
Royal 
(Irwin) 
 synclines pass through the center and eastern portions of the properties with a trend and incline to 
 the Northeast. 
The Amity, Murrysville, and Belle Vernon 
anticlines (listed from west to east) reside 
 to the 
center and western 
portions of the 
properties. 
These anticlines 
often coincide 
with thicker 
 coal seams where peat accumulated 
in domes along the anticlinal crest. 
It is understood that local 
 anticlines 
represent 
the upthrown 
side of 
syn-depositionally 
active 
deep 
faults. 
Inversely, 
fluvial 
 channel sediments were deposited on the structural downthrown 
side within synclines. 

 Within the Pangburn, 
Shaner, 
and Fallowfield mine-plan 
areas, the Upper 
Freeport is typically 
183 
 meters to 
335 meters below 
the ground surface. 
Mine access is therefore 
to be provided 
by shaft 
 and slope development. 
The planned Pangburn shaft depth is 
approximately 195 meters 
in depth. 

 The 
shaft 
depths 
at 
the 
projected 
locations 
for 
the 
Shaner 
and 
Fallowfield 
shafts 
range 
from 
 approximately 232 meters to 
268 meters. 

 6.2
 Mineralization 
 The coal to be produced at The Mon Valley 
Complex is typically high volatile (>31 volatile matter) 
 bituminous coal.

 Historic 
underground 
mining 
has 
occurred 
in 
the 
overlying 
Pittsburgh 
Seam 
on 
this 
property. 

 Contour 
surface 
mining 
on 
the 
Pittsburgh 
and 
Redstone 
outcrop 
has 
occurred 
within 
the 
areas 
 projected 
for 
the coal 
refuse 
disposal area, 
the slope 
portal 
area and 
the preparation 
plant 
area. 

 The three 
proposed mines 
(Pangburn, Shaner, 
and Fallowfield) 
are all 
projected to 
be deep mines 
 in the Upper 
Freeport seam. 
Mining is projected 
in areas where 
the total seam 
thickness exceeds 
 1.2 meters. 
Areas of 
sandstone washout 
and seam thinning 
have been 
excluded from 
projections 
 by MM A personnel. 
Additional exploration could identify additional geologically 
limiting features, 
 which could alter the proposed mine plan. 
The Upper Freeport seam in the projected areas ranges 
 from 0.7 meters to 3.1 meters 
thick and averages 1.95 meters thick.

 Exploration 
 7.1
 Nature and Extent of Exploration 
 Extensive exploration in the form of subsurface drill efforts has been carried out on the Property by 
 numerous 
entities, 
most 
of 
which 
efforts 
were 
completed 
prior 
to 
the 
acquisition 
by 
Coronado. 

 Diamond 
core 
and 
rotary 
drilling 
are 
the 
primary types 
of exploration 
on the 
Property. 
Data 
for 
 correlation 
and mining 
conditions 
are 
derived 
from 
core 
descriptions 
and geophysical 
logging (e-
 logging). 
Coal quality analyses were also 
employed during the core 
exploration process. 
A total of 
 approximately 750 core and rotary 
holes have been drilled for exploration. 
 The location of the drilling is shown on the maps included in 
 Appendix B
 . 
 The 
concentration 
of 
exploration 
varies 
slightly 
across 
the 
Property. 
Drilling 
on 
the 
Property 
is 
 typically 
sufficient 
for 
delineation 
of 
potential 
underground 
mineable 
benches. 
Core 
logging 
is 
 carried out by professional 
geologists in cases where 
roof and floor strata 
are of particular interest 
 and in cases 
where greater resolution and 
geologic detail are 
needed. 
Generally speaking, however, 
 most drill 
hole data 
come from 
simplified driller s 
logs, which 
often lack 
specific details 
regarding 
 geotechnical 
conditions 
and 
specific 
geology, 
making 
correlations 
and 
floor 
and 
roof 
conditions 
 difficult to 
determine. 
Geophysical logging 
(e-logging) techniques, 
by contrast, 
document specific 
 details 
useful 
for 
geologic 
interpretation 
and 
mining 
conditions. 
Given 
the 
variability 
of 
data-
 gathering 
methods, 
 definitive
 
mapping 
of 
future 
mining 
conditions 
may 
not 
be 
possible, 
but 
 projections and assumptions can be made within a 
 reasonable
 
degree of certainty. 
 A significant effort 
was put into 
verifying the integrity 
of the database. 
Once this was established, 
 stratigraphic 
columnar 
sections 
were 
generated 
using 
cross-sectional 
analysis 
to 
establish 
or 
 confirm coal seam correlations. 
A typical cross-section is shown in 
 Figure 7-1

 Due to 
the long history 
of exploration 
by various 
parties on the 
Property, 
a wide 
variety of 
survey 
 techniques exist for 
documentation of data 
point locations. 
Many of 
the older 
exploration drill holes 
 appear to 
have been 
located by 
survey and 
more recently-completed 
drill holes 
are often 
located 
 by high-resolution Global 
Positioning System GPS) units. 
However, some holes appear 
to have been 
 approximately 
located 
using 
USGS 
topography 
maps 
or 
other 
methods 
which 
are 
less 
accurate. 

 Therefore, 
discretion 
had 
to 
be 
used 
regarding 
the 
accuracy 
for 
the 
location 
and 
ground 
surface 
 elevation of 
some of these 
older drill holes. 
In instances 
where a drill 
hole location 
(or associated 
 coal 
seam 
elevations) 
appeared 
to 
be 
inconsistent 
with 
the 
overall 
structural 
trend 
(or 
surface 
 topography 
for surface 
-mineable areas), 
the data 
point was 
not honored 
for 
geological modeling. 

 Others with apparently minor variances were adjusted 
and then used by MM A. 

 Surveying of the underground and surface mined areas has been performed by the mine operators 
 and/or 
their 
consulting 
surveyors. 
By 
assignment, 
MM A 
did 
not 
verify 
the 
accuracy 
or 
 completeness of supplied 
mine maps but 
accepted this information as 
being the 
work of responsible 
 engineers and surveyors. 
 MM A 
compiled 
comprehensive 
topographic 
map 
files 
by 
selecting 
the 
best 
available 
aerial 
 mapping for each area and filling any gaps with digital USGS topographic 
mapping. 
 7.2
 Non-Drilling Procedures and Parameters 
 All pertinent data used to characterize the 
coal resources and coal reserves have been acquired via 
 exploration-based drilling methods. 
The region has historically produced and sold Upper Freeport-
 based coal 
into metallurgical 
and thermal 
markets, enhancing 
the confidence 
of the 
marketability 
 and quality of the resource. 

 7.3
 Drilling Procedures 
 Core drilling methods 
utilize NX-size (~5.4 centimeter) or similar-sized core cylinders 
to recover core 
 samples, which 
can 
be used 
to 
delineate 
geologic characteristics, 
for 
coal-quality 
testing,

 geotechnical 
logging. 
With core 
holes, geophysical 
logs are 
especially useful 
in verifying 
the core 
 recovery of both the coal samples (for assurance that the sample is representative of the full seam) 
 and 
of 
the 
roof 
and 
floor 
rock 
samples 
(for 
evaluating 
ground 
control 
characteristics 
of 
deep 
 mineable coal 
seams). 
In addition 
to the 
core holes, 
rotary-drilled holes 
also exist 
on most 
of the 
 Property. 
Data 
for 
the 
rotary-drilled 
holes 
are 
mainly 
derived 
from 
downhole 
geophysical 
logs, 
 which are 
used to 
interpret coal 
and rock thickness 
and depth, 
since logging of 
the drill cuttings 
is 
 unreliable. 
Exploratory drilling generally requires drilling to depths of 
over 152 meters to penetrate 
 the target coal seam at Mon Valley 
. 
 A wide variety 
of core-logging techniques 
exist for 
the properties. 
For many of 
the core holes, the 
 primary data 
source is a 
generalized 
lithology description by 
the driller, 
typically supplemented 
by 
 a more detailed 
core log completed 
by a geologist. 
These drilling logs were 
provided to MM A 
as 
 a geological database. 
MM A geologists were 
not involved 
in the production 
of original core 
logs 
 but did perform a 
basic check of information within 
the provided database. 
Where geophysical logs 
 for such holes were available, 
they were used by MM A geologists to 
verify the coal thickness and 
 core recovery of seams. 

 7.4
 Hydrology 
 Based on 
historical successful 
production of 
Upper Freeport, 
and stratigraphically 
proximal 
seams 
 in the 
region, the Mon 
Valley Complex is not 
expected to have hydrologic concerns 
of material issue. 

 Future 
mining 
is projected 
to 
occur 
in areas 
exhibiting 
similar hydrogeological 
conditions 
as 
past 
 mining, 
including 
stream 
undermining 
and 
undermining 
of 
aquifers. 
Based 
upon 
the 
successful 
 history of 
mining in the 
region with 
regards to 
hydrogeological 
features, MM A 
assumes that 
the 
 operations will not be hindered by such issues. 
 The Pittsburgh seam has 
been mined extensively above 
the Upper Freeport seam on 
the Property. 

 The 
interval 
(approximately 
183 
meters) 
between 
the 
seams 
is 
anticipated 
to 
be 
adequate 
to 
 minimize inflow of water to the planned operations 
from the overlying Pittsburgh works.

 Mining

were

 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 
 8.1
 Prior to Sending to the Lab 
 Most 
of the 
coal 
samples have 
been obtained 
from 
the Property 
by subsurface 
exploration 
using 
 core drilling 
techniques. 
The protocol 
for preparing 
and testing 
the samples 
has varied 
over time 
 and is 
not well 
documented for the 
older holes 
drilled on 
the Property. 
Typical core-drilling sampling 
 methods for 
coal in 
the United 
States 
involves 
drilling through 
the seam, 
removing the 
core from 
 the 
barrel, 
describing the 
lithology, 
wrapping 
the 
sample in 
a 
sealed 
plastic 
sleeve 
and 
placing it 
 lengthwise into 
a covered core 
box, and carefully 
marking hole ID and depth 
intervals on each box 
 and 
lid, allowing 
the 
core 
to 
be delivered 
to 
a 
laboratory 
in correct 
stratigraphic 
order, 
and with 
 original 
moisture 
content. 
This 
process 
has 
been 
the 
norm 
for 
both 
historical 
and 
ongoing 
 exploration activities at the Property. 
 This 
work 
is 
typically 
performed 
by 
the 
supervising 
driller, 
geologist, 
or 
company 
personnel. 

 Samples 
are 
most 
often 
delivered 
to 
the 
company 
by 
the 
driller 
after 
each 
shift 
or 
acquired 
by 
 company personnel 
or representatives. 
Most of the 
coal core 
samples were obtained 
by previous 
 or 
current 
operators 
on the 
Property. 
MM A did 
not participate 
in the 
collection, 
sampling and 
 analysis of the core samples. 
However, 
it is reasonable to assume, given the consistency 
of quality 
 from previous operators, that these samples 
were generally collected and processed under 
industry 
 best practices. 
This assumption is based on MM A s 
familiarity with the operating companies 
and 
 the companies used to perform the analyses. 

 8.2
 Lab Procedures 
 Coal quality 
testing has 
been performed 
over many 
years 
by operating 
companies using 
different 
 laboratories and testing regimens. 
Some of the 
samples have raw analyses and 
washabilities on the 
 full seam (with coal and rock parting layers co-mingled) and are mainly useful for characterizing the 
 coal quality for projected production from underground 
mining. 
Other samples have coal and rock 
 analyzed 
separately, 
the 
results 
of 
which 
can 
be 
manipulated 
to 
forecast 
either 
surface 
or 
 underground mining quality. 
Care has been 
taken to use only 
those analyses 
that are representative 
 of 
the 
coal 
quality 
parameters 
for 
the 
appropriate 
mining 
type 
for 
each 
sample. 
Unlike 
many 
 Appalachian 
properties, 
Mon 
Valley 
only 
has 
interest 
in 
one 
deep 
seam; 
therefore, 
the 
analyses 
 have likely been completed following 
a consistent protocol. 
 Standard procedure 
upon receipt of 
core samples by the 
testing laboratory 
is to log the 
depth and 
 thickness 
of 
the 
sample, 
then 
perform 
testing 
as 
specified 
by 
a 
representative 
of 
the 
operating 
 company. 
Each 
sample 
is 
then 
analyzed 
in 
accordance 
with 
procedures 
defined 
under 
 ASTM

 Data Verification 
 9.1
 Procedures of Qualified Person 
 MM A reviewed the digital geologic 
database supplied by Coronado. 
The database consists of 
data 
 records, which 
include drill hole 
information for 
holes that 
lie within and 
adjacent to 
the Property 
 and records 
for numerous 
supplemental coal 
seam thickness measurements. 
Upon completion of 
 the database 
verification, 
copies of 
each entry 
were 
printed, 
and cross 
referenced 
to the 
original 
 document for 
verification. 
Once the initial 
integrity of the 
database was 
established, stratigraphic 
 columnar sections were 
generated using 
cross-sectional analysis to 
establish or confirm 
coal-seam 
 correlations. 
Geophysical 
logs 
were 
used 
wherever 
available 
to 
assist 
in 
confirming 
the 
seam 
 correlation and to verify proper seam thickness measurements and recovery 
of coal samples. 

 After establishing and/or verifying proper seam correlation, seam data control maps and geological 
 cross-sections were generated 
and again used to verify seam correlations and data 
integrity. 
Once 
 the database was fully vetted, seam thickness, base-of-seam elevation, roof and 
floor lithology, and 
 overburden maps were independently generated 
for use in the mine planning process. 
 9.2
 Limitations 
 As with any exploration program, localized anomalies 
cannot always be discovered. 
The greater the 
 density of 
the samples 
taken, 
the less 
the risk. 
Once an 
area is 
identified as 
being of 
interest 
for 
 inclusion 
in 
the 
mine 
plan, 
additional 
samples 
are 
taken 
to 
help 
reduce 
the 
risk 
in 
those 
specific 
 areas. 
In general, provision is made in the mine planning portion of the study to allow for localized 
 anomalies that are typically classed more as a nuisance than a hinderance. 

 9.3
 Opinion of Qualified Person 
 Sufficient data 
has been obtained 
through various 
exploration 
and sampling programs 
and mining 
 operations 
to 
support 
the 
geological 
interpretations 
of 
seam 
structure 
and 
thickness 
for 
coal 
 horizons 
situated 
on the 
Property. 
The data 
is of 
sufficient 
quantity 
and reliability 
to 
reasonably 
 support the coal resource and coal reserve estimates in this TRS.

 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
 10.1
 Testing 
Procedures 
 Separate 
tabulations 
have 
been 
compiled 
for 
basic 
chemical 
analyses 
(both 
raw 
and 
washed 
 quality), petrographic data, rheological data 
and chlorine, ash, ultimate and sulfur analysis. 

 Available coal quality data was tabulated by resource area in a Microsoft EXCEL workbook and the 
 details of that work are maintained on file at 
the offices of Coronado and MM A. 
These tables also 
 provide 
basic 
statistical 
analyses 
of the 
coal quality 
data 
sets, 
including average 
value; 
maximum 
 and minimum values; and the number of 
samples available to represent 
each quality parameter of 
 the seam. 
Coal samples that 
were deemed 
by MM A geologists 
to be unrepresentative 
were not 
 used 
for 
statistical 
analysis 
of 
coal 
quality, 
as 
documented 
in 
the 
tabulations. 
A 
representative 
 group of drill hole 
samples from the Property 
were then checked against the original 
drill laboratory 
 reports to verify accuracy and correctness. 
 The amount and areal extent of coal sampling 
for geological data is generally sufficient to represent 
 the quality characteristics of 
the coal horizons 
and allow for 
proper market placement of 
the subject 
 coal seams. 
For some of 
the coal deposits 
there are considerable laboratory data 
from core samples 
 that 
are representative 
of full 
extent 
of the 
resource 
area; 
and for 
others 
there are 
more 
limited 
 data 
to 
represent 
the 
resource 
area. 
For 
example, 
in 
the 
active 
operations 
with 
considerable 
 previous 
mining, there 
may 
be limited 
quality data 
within some 
of the 
remaining resource 
areas; 
 however, 
in those 
cases the 
core sampling 
data can 
be supplemented 
with operational 
data from 
 mining and shipped quality samples representative of the resource area. 
 10.2
 Relationship of Tests 
to the Whole 
 The extensive 
sampling and 
testing procedures 
typically followed 
in the 
coal 
industry result 
in an 
 excellent 
correlation 
between 
samples and 
marketable 
product. 
The Upper 
Freeport 
seam has 
a 
 long 
history 
of 
saleable 
production 
in 
the 
high-volatile 
metallurgical 
and 
thermal 
markets, 
 consistent 
with 
exploration 
results. 
Degradation 
of 
coking 
coal 
characteristics 
over 
time 
is 
not 
 anticipated to be an issue.

 Mineral Resource Estimates 
 MM A independently created 
a geologic model to define 
the coal resources at 
the Property. 
Coal 
 resources were estimated 
as of December 31, 2022. 
 11.1
 Assumptions, Parameters and Methodology 
 Geological 
data 
was 
imported 
into 
Carlson 
Mining

(formerly 
SurvCADD 
geological 
modelling 
 software 
in the 
form 
of Microsoft

Excel 
files incorporating, 
drill hole 
collars, 
seam and 
thickness 
 picks, bottom 
seam elevations 
and raw 
and washed 
coal quality. 
These data 
files were 
validated 
 prior to importing into the software. 
Once imported, a geologic model was created, reviewed, and 
 verified with 
a key 
element being 
a gridded model 
of coal 
seam thickness. 
Resource tonnes 
were 
 estimated by using the 
seam thickness grid 
based on each valid 
point of observation and 
by defining 
 resource confidence arcs around the 
points of observation. 
Points of observation for Measured 
and 
 Indicated 
confidence 
arcs 
were 
defined 
for 
all 
valid 
drill 
holes 
that 
intersected 
the 
seam 
using 
 standards 
deemed acceptable 
by MM A 
based on 
a detailed 
geologic evaluation 
and a 
statistical 
 analysis 
of 
all 
drill 
holes 
within 
the 
projected 
reserve 
areas 
as 
described 
in 
 Section 
11.1.1
 . 
The 
 geological 
evaluation 
incorporated 
an 
analysis 
of 
seam 
thickness 
related 
to 
depositional 
 environments, adjacent roof and floor lithologies, and structural influences. 
 After validating coal seam data and establishing correlations, the thickness and elevation for seams 
 of 
economic 
interest 
were 
used 
to 
generate 
a 
geologic 
model. 
Due 
to 
the 
relative 
structural 
 simplicity 
of 
the 
deposits 
and 
the 
reasonable 
continuity 
of 
the 
tabular 
coal 
beds, 
the 
principal 
 geological 
interpretation 
necessary 
to 
define 
the 
geometry 
of 
the 
coal 
deposits 
is 
the 
proper 
 modeling 
of 
their 
thickness 
and 
elevation. 
Both 
coal 
thickness 
and 
quality 
data 
are 
deemed 
by 
 MM A to be reasonably sufficient within the resource areas. 
Therefore, there is a reasonable level 
 of confidence in the geologic 
interpretations required for coal resource determination based on the 
 available data 
and the techniques applied to the data. 
 Table 11-1
 
below provides the geological mapping and 
coal tonnage estimation criteria used for the 
 coal resource

 To 
perform DHSA the data 
set was processed to remove 
any erroneous data points, 
clustered data 
 points, as 
well as 
directional trends. 
This was 
achieved through 
the use 
of histograms, 
as seen 
in 
 Figure 11-1
 , color coded scatter 
plots showing the geospatial positioning 
of the borings, 
 Figure 11-
 2
 , and trend analysis.

Seam Thickness 
 for the Upper Freeport Seam Present in the Mon 
 Valley Complex

 Thickness for the Upper Freeport Seam Present 
 in the Mon Valley Complex 
 Following the completion of 
data processing, a variogram 
of the data set was 
created, 
 Figure 11-3
 . 

 The 
variogram 
plots average 
square difference 
against 
the separation 
distance 
between 
the data 
 pairs. 
The 
separation 
distance 
is broken 
up into 
separate 
bins defined 
by a 
uniform 
lag distance 
 (e.g., for 
a lag 
distance of 
152 meters 
the bins 
would be 
0 
152 meters, 
153 
305 meters, 
etc.). 

 Each pair of data points that are less than one lag distance apart are reported in the first bin. 
If the 
 data 
pair 
is 
further 
apart 
than 
one 
lag 
distance 
but 
less 
than 
two 
lag 
distances 
apart, 
then 
the 
 variance is reported in the second bin. 
The numerical average for differences 
reported for each bin 
 is then plotted on the variogram. 
Care was taken to 
define the lag distance in such a way 
as to not 
 overestimate any nugget effect 
present in the data set. 
Lastly, modeled equations, often spherical, 
 gaussian, or 
exponential, are 
applied to 
the variogram 
in order 
to represent 
the data 
set across 
a 
 continuous spectrum.

 The estimation 
variance is 
then calculated 
using information 
from the 
modeled variogram 
as well 
 as 
charts 
published 
by 
Journel 
and 
Huijbregts 
(1978). 
This 
value 
estimates 
the 
variance 
from 
 applying 
a 
single 
central 
measurement 
to 
increasingly 
larger 
square 
blocks. 
Care 
was 
taken 
to 
 ensure any nugget effect present was added back 
into the data. 
This process was repeated for each 
 test block size. 
 The final step of the process 
is to calculate the 
global estimation variance. 
In this step the number 
 square 
blocks that 
would fit 
inside the 
selected study 
area is 
determined for 
each block 
size that 
 was 
investigated 
in the 
previous 
step. 
The estimation 
variance 
is then 
divided by 
the number 
of 
 blocks that 
would fit 
inside the 
study area 
for 
each test 
block size. 
Following this 
determination, 
 the data is then transformed back to represent 
the relative error in the 95
 th
 -percentile range. 
 Figure 11-4 
 shows the results 
of the 
DHSA performed on 
the Upper Freeport 
data for the 
Mon Valley 
 Complex. 
DHSA provides hole 
to hole 
spacing values, 
these distances need 
to be converted 
to radius 
 from a central point in order to 
compare to the historical standards. 
A summary of the radius data 
 is shown 
in 
 Table

DHSA prescribes

levels of relative error, 
respectively.

than

with 
regards

The Gaussian and Spherical 
models recommend using a radius 
of 
 0.72 kilometers 
for 
measured resources 
compared to 
the historical 
value of 
0.4 kilometers. 
With 
 respect 
to 
indicated 
resources 
the 
DHSA 
falls 
in 
line 
closely 
with 
the

The

kilometers, while the Spherical and Gaussian 
 models recommend a radius of 1.42 
kilometers, respectively. 
These values line up closely with the 
 historical radius 
of 1.2 kilometers. 
These results have 
led the QPs 
to report the 
data following 
the 
 historical classification standards, rather 
than use the results of the DHSA.

 Qualified Person s Opinion 
 While 
there 
is 
some 
level 
of 
stratigraphically 
controlled 
seam-thickness 
variability 
due 
to 
sand 
 channels, 
etc., 
the 
Upper 
Freeport 
coal 
seam 
on 
the 
mine 
property 
at 
Mon 
Valley 
demonstrate 
 reasonable thickness consistency 
according to 
the classification system 
of 
 measured
 
(0 kilometers 
 0.4 
kilometers), 
 indicated
 
(0.4 kilometers 
to 1.2 
kilometers), 
and 
 inferred
 
(1.2 kilometers 
to 4.8 
 kilometers). 
MM A geologists and 
engineers modeled 
the deposit 
and delineated 
mineable regions 
 to 
reflect 
the nature 
of each 
seam and 
the practicality 
of mining 
constraints. 
Based on 
MM A s 
 geostatistical 
analysis, 
it 
would 
be 
possible 
to 
extend 
the 
measured, 
indicated 
and 
inferred 
arcs 
 slightly beyond 
historically accepted 
practices due to 
consistent geological 
settings. 
The QPs have 
 again 
elected 
not 
to 
extend 
arc 
distances, 
introducing 
a 
level 
of 
conservatism 
in 
measured 
and 
 indicated coal classification. 
 Based on the data 
review, 
the attendant work 
done to verify the data 
integrity and the creation 
of 
 an 
independent 
geologic model, 
the 
QPs 
believe 
this 
is a 
fair 
and 
accurate 
representation 
of the 
 Mon Valley coal resources.

 Upon completion of delineation 
and calculation of coal 
resources, MM A generated a LOM plan 
for 
 each of the projected 
mines within the Mon Valley 
Complex. 
The footprint of 
each reserve area 
is 
 shown on the maps in 
 Appendix B
 . 
The mine plans were generated based on the 
forecast mine plan 
 and

plan 
provided 
by 
Coronado 
with 
modifications 
by 
MM A 
where

due 
to

or 
other 
factors 
determined 
 during the evaluation. 
 Carlson Mining 
software was 
used to 
generate 
the LOM

Mon Valley. 
The mine 
plan was 
 sequenced 
based 
on 
productivity 
schedules 
provided 
by

MM A 
determined 
the

 practice. 
 At 
the Mon

mines, a 
minimum mining 
height 
of 1.4 
meters 
was 
generally 
used due 
to the 
 continuous mining method 
being employed; 
however, Pangburn was mapped at 
a 0.92-meter cutoff 
 in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
Coronado 
mine 
plan. 
For

Mine 
recovery 
generally 
varies 
between

Plant recovery is 
a function 
of in-seam 
recovery, OSD and plant efficiency 
 factor, 
which is set at 95 percent. 
Typical entry width is 5.8 meters.

 The coal resource mapping and estimation process, described in the report, was 
used as a basis for 
 the coal reserve 
estimate. 
Proven and 
probable coal 
reserves were 
derived from 
the defined coal 
 resource 
considering 
relevant 
processing, 
economic 
(including 
technical 
estimates 
of 
capital, 
 revenue, and cost), marketing, 
legal, environmental, socio-economic, and 
regulatory factors and are 
 presented on a moist, recoverable 
basis. 
 As is customary 
in the USA, the categories 
for proven 
and probable coal reserves 
are based on the 
 distances 
from 
valid 
points 
of 
measurement 
as 
determined 
by 
the 
QPs 
for 
the 
area 
under 
 consideration. 
For this 
evaluation, measured 
resource, which 
may convert 
to a 
proven reserve, 
is 
 based on a 0.4-kilometer radius from a valid point of observation. 
 Points 
of observation 
include exploration 
drill holes, 
degas holes, 
and mine 
measurements which 
 have been fully vetted 
and processed into a 
geologic model. 
The geologic model is based on seam 
 depositional modeling, the 
interrelationship of overlying and 
underlying strata on seam mineability, 
 seam thickness trends, 
the impact of seam 
structure (i.e., faulting), 
intra-seam characteristics, 
etc. 

 Once 
the 
geologic 
model 
was 
completed, 
a 
statistical 
analysis, 
described 
in 
 Section 
11.1.1
 
was 
 conducted 
and 
a 
0.4-kilometer 
radius 
from 
a 
valid 
point 
of 
observation 
was 
selected 
to 
define 
 Measured Resources. 

 Likewise, 
the distance 
between 0.4 
and 1.2 of 
a kilometer 
radius was 
selected to 
define Indicated 
 Resources. 
Indicated Resources may convert 
to Probable Reserves 

 Inferred Resources (greater 
than a 1.2-kilometer radius from a valid point of observation) are to be 
 excluded from Reserve consideration. 
 12.2
 Qualified Person s Estimates 
 Reserve tonnage

 Table 11-3
 , and not in addition to coal resources. 
Coal reserves are presented on 
 a ROM basis in 
 Table

 . 
Proven and probable 
coal reserves were

coal 
 resource considering 
relevant mining, 
processing, infrastructure, 
economic (including estimates 
of 
 capital, revenue, and cost), marketing, legal, 
environmental, socio-economic and regulatory factors. 

 The coal reserves, as shown in

study 
of 
the 
coal 
deposits. 
The

to 
which 
the 
coal 
reserves 
may 
be 
 affected by any 
known environmental, permitting, legal,

Note: Marketable reserve tonnes are reported on a moist basis, including a combination of surface and inherent moisture. 
The combination of 
 surface and inherent moisture is modeled at 6-percent. 
Actual product moisture is dependent upon multiple geological factors, operational 
 factors, and product contract specifications and can exceed 8-percent. 
As such, the modeled moisture values provide a level of conservatism 
 for reserve reporting. 
 The 
results 
of 
this 
TRS 
define 
an 
estimated 
134.4 
Mt 
of 
proven 
and 
probable 
marketable 
coal 
 reserves. 
Of that total, 58 percent are proven, and 42 percent are probable. 
There are 133.4 Mt of 
 owned 
coal 
reserves 
and 
1.0 
Mt 
of 
leased 
coal 
reserves. 
All 
of 
the 
Mon

reserves 
are 
 considered 
to 
be 
suitable 
for 
the 
metallurgical 
coal 
market. 
All 
of 
the 
Mon

reserves 
are 
 unassigned.
 12.3
 Qualified Person s Opinion 
 The 
estimate 
of coal 
reserves was 
determined 
in accordance 
with the 
JORC 
Code along 
with SEC 
 Regulation S-K 1300. 
 The LOM 
mining plans 
for Mon 
Valley 
were prepared 
to the 
level of 
preliminary feasibility. 
Mine 
 projections 
were 
prepared, 
and 
timing 
scheduled 
to 
match 
production 
with 
coal 
seam 
 characteristics. 
Production timing 
was carried 
out from 
current locations 
to depletion 
of the 
coal 
 reserve 
area. 
Coal reserve 
estimates 
could be 
materially 
affected 
by the 
risk factors 
described in 
 Section 22.2
 . 
 Based on the Preliminary Feasibility Study 
and the attendant Economic Review, the QPs believe this 
 is a fair and accurate calculation of the Mon Valley 
coal reserves. 
 13
 Mining Methods 
 Three separate underground mine areas were modeled and tested economically 
for the Mon Valley 
 Complex. 
Once the Resources were calculated, 
mine plans were created to 
project operating each 
 resource 
area to 
depletion, with 
crews 
and equipment

 Geotech and Hydrology 
 Mining 
plans 
for 
potential 
underground 
mines 
were 
developed 
by 
Coronado 
and 
MM A. 
Pillar 
 stability 
was 
tested 
by MM A 
using the 
 Analysis of 
Coal Pillar 
Stability 
(ACPS)
 
program 
that 
was 
 developed by the 
 National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health NIOSH)
 . 
MM A reviewed 
 the results from the ACPS analysis and considered them in the development of the LOM plan. 
 Hydrology is not 
expected to be 
an issue of concern at 
Mon Valley. 
Extensive mining has occurred 
 in the Pittsburgh seam, 
183 meters above the Upper 
Freeport horizon. 
The Upper Freeport coal 
has 
 been mined 
in the 
region based on 
successful historical 
mining in 
comparable 
geologic settings, 
 material impacts related to hydrology 
are not anticipated to be of concern. 
 13.2
 Production Rates 
 The Mon Valley Complex is not 
yet active, with three 
distinct mines and preparation plants 
planned. 

 The 
mine 
plan 
and 
productivity 
expectations 
reflect 
historical 
performance 
of 
similar 
operations 
 and efforts have been made to adjust the 
plan to reflect future conditions. 
MM A is confident that 
 the mine plan 
is reasonably representative to provide 
an accurate estimation of 
coal reserves. 
Mine 
 development and operation has not been optimized within the TRS. 
 Production 
is 
scheduled 
for 
approximately 
273 
days 
each 
year, 
which 
represents 
production 
on 
 Monday through 
Friday plus 
every other 
Saturday with 
allowances for 
holidays. 
On each day, 
the 
 continuous mining 
sections produce coal 
on two shifts; 
the third shift 
is reserved for 
maintenance 
 and mine conveyor 
belt and power 
moves. 
The sections are 
configured as full 
super sections with 
 two continuous 
miners per 
section. 
Productivity is 
planned at 
the rate 
of 272 
meters 
of advance 
 per shift for 
the super sections. 
 Carlson Mining software was used 
by MM A to generate mine plans 
for the underground mineable 
 coal 
seam. 
Mine 
plans 
were 
sequenced 
based 
on 
productivity 
schedules 
provided 
by 
Coronado, 
 which 
were 
based 
on 
historically 
achieved 
productivity 
levels. 
All 
production 
forecasting 
ties 
 assumed production rates 
to geological models as 
constructed by MM A s 
team of geologists 
and 
 mining engineers. 
 As shown in 
 Table 
13-1
 , the areas 
planned for 
underground mines 
produce coal 
until 2100. 
Clean 
 coal production varies directly with coal thickness.

 Mining Related Requirements 
 A mine plan with 
sequenced mining projections was prepared for each logical 
mining unit. 
For each 
 mine 
plan, 
the 
appropriate 
number 
of 
production 
units 
is 
selected 
for 
the 
resource 
area, 
and 
a 
 productivity 
level 
assigned, 
expressed 
in 
meters 
of 
advance 
per 
unit-shift 
of 
production. 
The 
 productivity is 
based on 
the equipment 
and personnel 
configuration, 
mining height 
and expected 
 physical conditions. 
 13.4
 Required Equipment and Personnel 
 Production 
from 
the proposed 
Mon Valley 
Complex 
mines will 
be conducted 
using the 
room 
and 
 pillar method, 
utilizing continuous miners 
and haulage 
using shuttle cars 
to a 
feeder-breaker located 
 at the 
tail of 
the section 
conveyor 
belt. 
The feeder-breaker 
crushes large 
pieces of 
coal and 
rock 
 and regulates 
coal feed 
onto 
the mine 
conveyor. 
Roof-bolting 
machines are 
used to 
support the 
 roof 
on the 
continuous miner 
sections. 
Roof-bolting 
machines are 
used to 
install 
roof 
bolts, 
and 
 battery scoops are available to clean the 
mine entries and assist 
in delivery of mine 
supplies to work 
 areas. 
Other 
supplemental 
equipment, 
such 
as 
personnel 
carriers, 
supply 
vehicles, 
etc., 
are 
also 
 used daily. 
 Mine conveyors typically range in width 
up to 1.5 
meters. 
Multiple belt flights 
are arranged in series 
 to deliver raw coal to the underground storage. 
Along the main and sub-main entries and panels, a 
 travel way 
is provided for 
personnel and materials 
by rubber-tired 
equipment or on rail. 
The Mon 
 Valley 
mines will use 
conveyors 
to transport 
ROM coal from 
the underground 
production sections 
 to 
the 
surface 
where 
the 
coal 
may 
be 
sampled, 
crushed, 
washed 
in 
the 
preparation 
plant, 
and 
 stockpiled to await shipment. 

 Surface 
ventilation 
fans 
are 
installed 
as 
needed 
to 
provide 
a 
sufficient 
volume 
of 
air 
to 
ventilate 
 production sections, coal 
haulage and transport 
entries, battery charging stations, and 
transformers 
 in accordance with approved plans. 
High-voltage cables deliver power throughout the mine where 
 transformers reduce voltage for specific equipment 
requirements. 

 The Mine 
Improvement and New 
 Emergency Response Act of 2006
 MINER Act) requires that carbon monoxide detection systems be 
 installed 
along 
mine 
conveyor 
belts 
and 
that 
electronic 
two-way 
tracking 
and 
communications 
 systems 
be 
installed 
throughout 
underground 
mines. 
Water 
is 
required 
to 
control 
dust 
at 
 production sections and along conveyor 
belts, and to cool electric motors. 
Water is available 
from 
 nearby sources and is distributed within the mine by pipelines as required.

 Mine: 
Pangburn 
 The Pangburn mine is proposed to start in 2032 with 
three continuous mining sections. 
The Upper 
 Freeport 
seam 
will 
be 
accessed 
via

Each section 
is configured as 
full supersection 
with two 
continuous 
 miners available 
for production. 
Productivity is 
planned at 
the rate 
of 272 
meters of 
advance per 
 shift for the super sections. 
A total of 203 employees are assigned to the mine. 
 Principal production equipment on 
each section includes two continuous 
miners, two roof 
bolters, 
 four shuttle 
cars, and two 
scoops. 
Coal is extracted 
from the production 
face with the 
continuous 
 miner and hauled to the mine conveyor in shuttle cars. 
At the conveyor belt, the coal is discharged 
 from the shuttle cars onto a 
feeder breaker for transfer onto the conveyor. 
The conveyors carry the 
 coal outside, where 
it is transported 
via overland conveyor 
to the proposed 
Pangburn preparation 
 plant and barge load-out on the Monongahela River. 
Rail access is provided by a
 CSX rail line. 
 The proposed Pangburn mine will be located approximately 1.6 kilometers south of the community 
 of Elizabeth, 
Pennsylvania. 
Main paved 
roads exist 
both east 
and west 
of the 
site. 
The proposed 
 dock, located on the western boundary of the 
proposed Pangburn permit area, is currently used for 
 bulk material transshipment. 
The area has hosted 
both industrial and residential 
development for 
 an 
extensive 
time 
period. 
No 
extraordinary 
measures 
or 
expenses 
will 
be 
required 
to 
establish 
 infrastructure or utilities at the Pangburn site. 

 The 
preliminary 
design 
for 
the 
Pangburn 
mine 
surface 
facilities 
was 
provided 
by 
Coronado. 
The 
 facilities include offices, warehouses, 
shops, and a bathhouse for personnel; 
a preparation plant to 
 process ROM coal; a 
refuse area with 
a designed capacity 
of approximately 35 million 
refuse tonnes; 
 raw coal storage at the plant totaling 
approximated 100,000 tonnes, clean coal storage 
at the plant 
 site of 
approximately 
54,000 tonnes, 
and three 
clean coal 
stockpiles adjacent 
to the 
dock loading 
 facility 
on 
the 
Monongahela 
River. 
The 
three 
river 
stockpiles 
have 
a 
designed 
capacity 
of 
 approximately 266,000 tonnes. 
 A 
study 
completed 
and 
approved 
through 
the 
 Pennsylvania 
Department 
of 
Environmental 
 Protection
 
on behalf 
of Coronado 
has

a 
Preferred 
Site 
for 
refuse 
disposal 
at 
Pangburn 
 with 
capacity 
of 
22.6 
million 
cubic 
meters. 
MM A s 
estimated 
requirements 
for

 Mine: Fallowfield 
 The 
Fallowfield 
mine 
is 
proposed 
to 
start 
in 
2057 
with 
three 
production 
sections. 
The 
Upper 
 Freeport 
seam 
will 
be 
accessed 
via 
a 
decline 
slope 
and 
vertical 
shaft. 
This 
mine 
will 
be 
a 
 metallurgical coal operation on leased and owned mineral 
property. 
 Production 
is 
scheduled 
for 
approximately 
273 
days 
each 
year, 
which 
represents 
production 
on 
 Monday 
through 
Friday 
and 
every 
other 
Saturday. 
On 
each 
day, 
three 
production 
sections 
are 
 scheduled 
to 
produce 
coal 
on 
two 
shifts; 
the 
third 
shift 
is 
reserved 
for 
maintenance 
and 
mine 
 conveyor belt and power 
moves. 
The sections are 
configured as super sections 
with two continuous 
 miners available 
for production. 
Productivity is 
planned at 
the rate 
of 272 
meters of 
advance per 
 shift of operation. 
A total of 203 employees are assigned to the mine. 
 Principal production equipment includes 
two continuous miners, two roof bolters, four shuttle 
cars, 
 and two scoops. 
Coal is extracted from 
the production face with the 
continuous miner and hauled 
 to the mine 
conveyor in 
shuttle cars. 
At the conveyor 
belt, the coal 
is discharged from 
the shuttle 
 cars 
onto 
a feeder 
breaker 
for transfer 
onto the 
conveyor. 
The conveyors 
carry the 
coal outside, 
 where 
it 
is 
transported 
to 
the 
Fallowfield 
preparation 
plant 
and 
truck 
load-out 
via 
overland 
 conveyor.

 Requirements for Energy, 
Water, 
Material and Personnel 
 The Mon Valley property has sources 
of water, 
power, 
personnel, and supplies readily available for 
 use. 
Personnel 
have 
historically 
been 
sourced 
from 
the 
surrounding 
communities 
in 
Allegheny, 
 Washington, and 
Westmoreland Counties, and have 
proven to be adequate 
in numbers to operate 
 the mines. 
As mining is common in the surrounding 
areas, the workforce 
is generally familiar 
with 
 mining practices, and 
many are experienced 
miners. 
Water is 
expected to be 
sourced locally from 
 nearby public 
water 
sources or 
rivers. 
Electricity is 
anticipated 
to be 
sourced from 
West 
Penn
 or 
 Duquesne 
Light. 
The 
service 
industry 
in 
the 
areas 
surrounding 
the 
proposed 
mine 
complex 
has 
 historically 
provided 
supplies, 
equipment 
repairs 
and 
fabrication,

 Infrastructure 
 Due 
to 
the 
projected 
starting 
date 
for 
the 
Mon 
Valley 
mines, 
only 
conceptual 
design 
of 
 infrastructure and surface facilities has 
been completed to date. 

 The proposed Pangburn mine will be located approximately 1.6 kilometers south of the community 
 of Elizabeth, PA. 
Main paved roads exist both 
east and west of 
the site. 
The proposed dock, located 
 on the western boundary of the proposed Pangburn permit area, is currently used for bulk 
material 
 transhipment. 
The area 
has hosted 
both industrial 
and residential 
development 
for 
an extensive 
 time period. 
No extraordinary measures or expenses will be 
required to establish infrastructure 
or 
 utilities at the Pangburn site. 

 The Shaner 
mine will 
be located approximately 1.6 
kilometers north of 
the community 
of Sutersville, 
 PA, 
between the Youghiogheny 
and Monongahela Rivers. 
Numerous improved 
roads traverse 
the 
 Property. 
An additional 
shaft and 
slope will 
be required 
to access 
Upper Freeport 
seam reserves 
 west of the Monongahela 
River, 
accessed across the 1
 st
 
Street bridge and Douglass 
Run Road. 
The 
 immediate 
vicinity 
of 
the 
proposed 
Shaner 
surface 
facilities 
is 
well 
developed; 
no 
extraordinary 
 measures or expenses will be required to establish 
infrastructure or utilities at the Shaner site.

 Market Studies 
 16.1
 Market Description 
 The quality 
characteristics for 
the subject 
coal resources 
and coal 
reserves have 
been reviewed 
in 
 detail 
by MM A. 
The drill 
hole data 
were 
utilized to 
develop 
average 
coal quality 
characteristics 
 for 
the mining 
site. 
These average 
coal 
quality characteristics 
were 
then utilized 
as the 
basis for 
 determining the various markets into which the saleable coal will likely 
be placed. 

 The projected quality specifications for the Mon Valley 
products are as shown in 
 Table 16-1
 .

Life-of-
 mine sulfur for Pangburn is an estimated 1.21 ; however, 
 overall Mon Valley Complex reserve average is 1.36 
 sulfur. 
 All of the mine production is projected to serve the metallurgical markets. 
The metallurgical coal is 
 marketed 
as a 
high-volatile (typically 
greater 
than 31 
percent 
volatile matter 
content) product 
on 
 both the domestic and export markets. 
 16.2
 Price Forecasts 
 Coronado provided 
MM A with 
price forecasts 
for its 
active operations. 
Customer coal 
pricing is 
 derived 
from 
market 
observed 
forward 
estimates 
based 
on 
global economic 
supply 
and 
demand 
 analysis 
which 
is 
applied 
to 
mine 
plan 
sales 
volumes 
and 
product 
mix 
and 
is 
supplemented 
with 
 Coronado s in-house knowledge of applicable rail transportation charges, ocean 
freight charges and 
 port 
charges. 
MM A 
extrapolated 
the 
provided 
data 
for 
the 
greenfield 
Mon 
Valley 
operations. 

 Concurrent with aforementioned quality parameters 
in the preceding section, production from the 
 proposed operations 
is assumed to 
be sold in 
high volatile 
domestic and export 
coal markets 
with 
 respective percentages of 66 percent 
and 34 percent. 
The pricing data assumes HVB domestic and 
 export FOB-mine 
prices of approximately 
 130 and 114 
per metric tonne 
for calendar 
year 2028. 

 HVB domestic 
and export 
prices respectively 
increase to 
approximately 
 204 and 178 
per metric 
 tonne through year 2050, and then increased by 2 annual inflation thereafter.

 16.3
 Contract Requirements 
 Some contracts are necessary for successful marketing of the 
coal. 
For Mon Valley, since all mining, 
 preparation and marketing is done in-house, the remaining 
contracts required are: 
 > 
 Transportation
 
 The Mine contracts with barge transportation 
companies or with CSX Railroad 
 to transport the coal to either of the domestic customers 
ports for overseas shipments. 
 > 
 Handling
 
 Contracts for loading vessels for export 
sales are necessary. 
These are typically 
 handled by annual negotiations based on projected shipments. 
 > 
 Sales 
 Sales contracts are a mix of spot and contract sales. 
With the volatility of the market, 
 long-term contracts are not typically written.

 Permit Requirements and Status 
 All 
mining 
operations 
are 
subject 
to 
federal

laws 
and 
must 
obtain 
permits 
to 
operate 
 mines, coal preparation and related facilities, 
haul roads, and other incidental surface disturbances 
 necessary for 
mining to 
occur. 
Permits 
generally 
require 
that 
the 
permittee 
post 
a 
performance 
 bond in 
an amount 
established by the 
regulatory program to provide 
assurance that any 
disturbance 
 or liability 
created during 
mining operations 
is properly 
restored 
to an 
approved post-mining 
land 
 use and 
that all 
regulations and 
requirements 
of the 
permits are 
fully satisfied 
before 
the bond 
is 
 returned 
to 
the 
permittee.

 Mine Closure Plans 
 Applicable 
regulations 
require 
that 
mines 
be 
properly 
closed, 
and 
reclamation 
commenced 
 immediately 
upon 
abandonment. 
In 
general, 
site 
reclamation 
includes 
removal 
of 
structures, 
 backfilling, regrading, and revegetation of disturbed areas. 
Sediment control is required during the 
 establishment of vegetation, and 
bond release generally requires 
a minimum 
five-year period of 
site 
 maintenance, water sampling, and 
sediment control following 
mine completion. 
This requirement 
 is 
reduced 
to 
two 
years 
for 
certain 
operations 
involving 
re-mining. 
Reclamation 
of underground 
 mines includes 
closure and 
sealing of 
mine openings 
such as 
portals and 
shafts in 
addition to 
the 
 items listed above. 

 Estimated 
costs 
for 
mine closure, 
including water 
quality monitoring 
during site 
reclamation, 
are 
 included in the financial 
model. 
As with all 
mining companies, an accretion 
calculation is performed 
 annually 
so the 
necessary Asset 
Retirement

be shown 
as

 The QPs know
 
of no reason that any permits that may be required cannot be 
obtained.

 Capital and Operating Costs 
 18.1
 Capital Cost Estimate 
 The production sequence selected for 
a property must consider the proximity 
of each reserve area 
 to 
coal 
preparation 
plants, 
river 
docks 
and 
railroad 
loading 
points, 
along 
with 
suitability 
of 
 production equipment to coal seam conditions. 
The in-place infrastructure was evaluated, and any 
 future needs were planned to a level suitable for a Preliminary Feasibility Study and included in the 
 Capital Forecast. 
 MM A 
 developed 
capital 
spending 
estimates 
for 
the 
proposed 
operations 
in 
the 
Mon 
Valley 
 Complex. 
MM A s 
capital schedules assume that major equipment rebuilds occur over the course 
 of each 
machine s remaining assumed operating 
life. 
Replacement equipment was 
scheduled based 
 on MM A s 
experience and 
knowledge of 
mining equipment 
and industry 
standards with 
respect 
 to the useful life of such equipment.

 Operating Cost Estimate 
 Coronado 
provided 
a 
historical 
summary 
of 
operating 
costs 
for 
similar 
operations 
for 
MM A s 
 review. 
MM A used the historical and/or budget cost information 
as a reference and developed a 
 personnel 
schedule 
for 
the 
mine. 
Hourly 
labor 
rates 
and 
salaries 
were 
based 
upon 
information 
 contained in Coronado s financial summaries. 
Fringe benefit costs were developed 
for vacation and 
 holidays, 
federal 
and 
state 
unemployment 
insurance, 
retirement, 
workers 
compensation 
and 
 pneumoconiosis, 
casualty 
and 
life 
insurance, 
healthcare, 
and 
bonuses. 
A 
cost 
factor 
for 
mine 
 supplies was developed that 
relates expenditures 
to mine advance 
rates for 
roof control 
costs and 
 other 
mine 
supply 
costs 
experienced 
at 
underground 
mines. 
Other 
factors 
were 
developed 
for 
 maintenance and repair costs, rentals, mine power, 
outside services and other direct mining costs. 

 Other 
cost 
factors 
were 
developed 
for 
coal 
preparation 
plant 
processing, 
refuse 
handling, 
coal 
 loading, property 
taxes, 
and insurance 
and bonding. 
Appropriate 
royalty 
rates 
were 
assigned for 
 production from leased coal lands and sales 
taxes were calculated 
for federal black 
lung excise tax, 
 and 
federal 
reclamation 
fees. 
There 
are 
currently 
no 
state 
coal 
severance 
or 
reclamation 
taxes 
 required in Pennsylvania. 
 Mandated Sales Related Costs such as Black Lung Excise are 
summarized in

 Economic Analysis 
 19.1
 Assumptions, Parameters and Methods 
 A pre-feasibility LOM plan 
was prepared by 
MM A for 
the proposed Mon 
Valley operations. 
MM A 
 prepared 
mine 
projections 
and 
production 
timing 
forecasts 
based 
on 
coal 
seam 
characteristics. 

 Production 
timing was 
carried out 
from 2032 
to depletion 
(exhaustion) 
of the 
coal reserve 
areas, 
 which is projected for the year 
2100. 
All costs and prices are based on 2022 nominal United States 
 dollars. 
 The Mine 
plan, productivity 
expectations and cost 
estimates generally reflect 
historical performance 
 by 
Coronado 
and 
efforts 
have 
been 
made 
to 
adjust 
plans 
and 
costs 
to 
reflect 
future 
conditions. 

 MM A is confident 
that the mine 
plan and 
financial model 
are reasonably representative to provide 
 an accurate estimation of coal reserves.

 Capital 
schedules were 
developed by 
MM A for 
mine development, 
infrastructure, 
and on-going 
 capital 
requirements 
for 
the 
life 
of the 
mine. 
Staffing 
levels 
were 
prepared, 
and operating 
costs 
 estimated 
by 
MM A. 
MM A 
utilized 
historical 
cost 
data 
provided 
by 
Coronado 
and 
its 
own 
 knowledge and experience to estimate direct and indirect operating 
costs. 

 The 
preliminary 
feasibility 
financial 
model, 
prepared 
for 
this 
TRS, 
was 
developed 
to 
test 
the 
 economic viability of 
the coal reserve 
area. 
The results of 
this financial model 
are not intended 
to 
 represent 
a 
bankable 
feasibility 
study, 
required 
for 
financing 
of 
any 
current 
or 
future 
mining 
 operations, 
but 
are 
intended 
to 
prove 
the 
economic 
viability 
of the 
estimated 
coal 
reserves. 
All 
 costs and prices are based on 2022 nominal United States dollars assuming a 2 inflation rate. 
 On an unlevered basis, the NPV of the project cash flows after taxes was 
estimated for the purpose 
 of 
classifying 
coal 
reserves. 
The 
project 
cash 
flows, 
excluding 
debt 
service, 
are 
calculated 
by 
 subtracting direct 
and indirect 
operating expenses 
and capital 
expenditures from 
revenue. 
Direct 
 costs include labor, drilling and 
blasting, operating supplies, 
maintenance and repairs, 
facilities costs 
 for 
materials 
handling, 
coal 
preparation, 
refuse 
disposal, 
coal 
loading, 
sampling 
and 
analysis 
 services, 
reclamation 
and 
general 
and 
administrative 
costs. 
Indirect 
costs 
include 
statutory 
and 
 legally 
agreed 
upon 
fees 
related 
to 
direct 
extraction 
of 
the 
mineral. 
The 
indirect 
costs 
are 
the 
 Federal 
black 
lung 
tax, 
Federal 
reclamation 
taxes, 
property 
taxes, 
local 
transportation 
prior 
to 
 delivery 
at 
rail 
or 
barge 
loading 
sites, 
coal 
production 
royalties, 
sales 
and 
use 
taxes, 
and 
income 
 taxes. 
Coronado s historical 
costs provided a useful reference 
for MM A s 
cost estimates. 
 Sales revenue is based on 
the metallurgical coal price information provided to MM A 
by Coronado. 
 Projected 
debt 
service 
is 
excluded 
from 
the 
P L 
and 
cash 
flow 
model 
in 
order 
to 
determine 
 Enterprise Value. 
 The financial model expresses coal sales prices, operating costs, and capital expenditures in current 
 day 
dollars 
without 
adjustment 
for 
inflation. 
Capital 
expenditures 
and 
reclamation 
costs 
are 
 included based 
on engineering 
estimates for 
each mine 
by year. 
The Coronado 
division s 
existing 
 allocations of administrative costs are 
continued in the future projections. 
 Coronado will pay royalties for the various current and projected operations. 
The royalty rates vary 
 by 
mining method 
and location. 
The 
royalty 
rates 
for 
Mon 
Valley 
are estimated 
to be 
7 of 
the 
 sales revenue. 
 The 
projection 
model 
also 
includes 
consolidated 
income 
tax 
calculations 
at 
the 
Coronado 
level, 
 incorporating statutory 
depletion calculations, as well 
as state income 
taxes, and a 
federal tax rate 
 of 
21 . 
To 
the 
extent 
the 
mine 
generates 
net 
operating 
losses 
for 
tax 
purposes, 
the 
losses 
are 
 carried over to offset future taxable 
income. 
The terms cash flows and project cash flows used 
 in this report refer to after tax 
cash flows. 
 Consolidated cash flows are driven by annual sales tonnage, which grows from 0.4 million 
tonnes in 
 2032 to a peak of 3.8 
million tonnes in 2060. 
Between years 2061 
and 2090, sales ranges from 
1.5

Projected consolidated 
revenue grows 
from 54.0 million 
in 2032 to 
a peak of 
 917.7 million in 2060. 
Revenue totals 37.6 billion for the project s 
life. 
 Consolidated cash flow from operations is positive throughout the projected operating period, with 
 the 
exception 
of post 
-production 
years, 
due to 
end-of-mine 
reclamation 
spending. 
Consolidated 
 cash flow from operations 
peaks at 374.3 million in

 Results 
 The 
pre-feasibility 
financial 
model, 
prepared 
by 
MM A 
for 
this 
TRS, 
was 
developed 
to 
test 
the 
 economic viability of 
each coal resource 
area. 
The results of 
this financial model 
are not intended 
 to represent 
a bankable feasibility 
study, 
as may be 
required for 
financing of any 
current or future 
 mining operations contemplated but are intended 
to prove the economic viability of the estimated 
 coal reserves. 
Optimization of the LOM plan was outside the scope of the engagement.

 Sensitivity 
 Sensitivity 
of the 
NPV 
results 
to 
changes 
in 
the 
key 
drivers 
is presented 
in the 
chart below. 
The 
 sensitivity study shows 
the NPV at 
the 10.0 discount rate 
when Base Case sales 
prices, operating 
 costs, and capital costs are increased and decreased in increments 
of 5 within a +/- 15 range. 
 Figure 19-2: 
Sensitivity of NPV 
 As shown, NPV is quite sensitive to changes in sales price and operating cost estimates, and slightly 
 sensitive to changes in capital cost estimates.

 Other Relevant Data and Information 
 MM A 
performed 
a 
previous 
audit of 
the 
Property 
in 
2017 for 
Coronado 
based 
on 
SEC 
Industry 
 Guide 
7 
standards. 
MM A 
has 
subsequently 
conducted 
Joint 
Ore 
Reserve 
Committee JORC) 
 compliant resource and reserve 
assessments of the 
Mon Valley assets as 
of: 
(1) December 31, 
2017, 
 (2) December 31, 2020, and (3) December 31, 2021. 
By assignment, the JORC assessment included 
 a 
preliminary 
feasibility 
level 
study 
of 
the 
subject 
coal 
reserves, 
encompassing 
detailed 
mine 
 planning and cost analysis 
through depletion of Mon 
Valley s 
JORC-compliant coal reserves. 
MM A 
 utilized these 
former preliminary 
feasibility 
studies as 
the basis 
of an 
updated 
study which 
meets 
 those standards set forth by the JORC Code and SEC. 
 22
 Interpretation and Conclusions 
 22.1
 Conclusion 
 Sufficient data 
has been obtained 
through various 
exploration and 
sampling programs 
and mining 
 operations 
to 
support 
the 
geological 
interpretations 
of 
seam 
structure 
and 
thickness 
for 
coal 
 horizons 
situated 
on the 
Property. 
The data 
is of 
sufficient 
quantity 
and reliability 
to 
reasonably 
 support the coal resource and coal reserve estimates 
in this TRS. 
 The 
geological 
data 
and 
preliminary 
feasibility 
study, 
which 
consider 
mining 
plans, 
revenue, 
and 
 operating 
and 
capital 
cost 
estimates 
are 
sufficient 
to 
support 
the 
classification 
of 
coal 
reserves 
 provided herein. 
 This geologic evaluation conducted in conjunction with the preliminary feasibility study is sufficient 
 to conclude that the 
134.4 Mt of marketable 
underground coal reserves 
identified on the Property 
 are 
economically 
mineable under 
reasonable 
expectations 
of market 
prices for 
metallurgical 
coal

 Risk Factors 
 Risks have 
been identified 
for 
operational, 
technical and 
administrative 
subjects addressed 
in the 
 Pre-Feasibility 
Study. 
A risk 
matrix has 
been constructed 
to present 
the risk 
levels for 
all the 
risk 
 factors identified and quantified in 
the risk assessment process. 
The risk matrix and 
risk assessment 
 process 
are 
modeled 
to 
that 
presented 
in 
the 
Australian 
and 
New 
Zealand 
Standard 
on 
Risk 
 Management (AS/NZS 4360).

 The 
purpose 
of 
the 
characterization 
of 
the 
project 
risk 
components 
is 
to 
inform 
the 
project 
 stakeholders 
of 
key 
aspects 
of 
the 
Coronado 
projects 
that 
can 
be 
impacted 
by 
events 
whose 
 consequences can affect 
the success of the venture. 
The significance of an impacted 
aspect of the 
 operation 
is 
directly 
related 
to 
both 
the 
probability 
of 
occurrence 
and 
the 
severity 
of 
the 
 consequences. 
The initial risk for 
a risk factor 
is herein defined 
as the risk level 
after the potential 
 impact 
of 
the 
risk 
factor 
is 
addressed 
by 
competent 
and 
prudent 
management 
utilizing 
control 
 measures readily available. 
Residual risk for a risk factor is herein defined as the risk 
level following 
 application 
of 
special 
mitigation 
measures 
if 
management 
determines 
that 
the 
initial 
risk 
level 
is 
 unacceptable. 
Initial risk and residual risk can be quantified numerically, 
derived by the product of 
 values assigned to probability and consequence ranging from very low risk to very high risk. 

 The probability and consequence 
parameters are subjective numerical estimates made 
by practiced 
 mine engineers and 
managers. 
Both are 
assigned values 
from 1 to 
5 for which 
the value 
1 represents 
 the 
lowest 
probability 
and least 
consequence, 
and the 
value 
5 represents 
the highest 
probability 
 and greatest 
consequence. 
The products, which define 
the Risk Level, 
are classified from 
very low 
 to very high.

 Risk aspects 
identified and 
evaluated 
during this 
assignment total 
13. 
No residual 
risks are 
rated 
 Very High. 
Four (4) residual risks are rated High. 
Six (6) of the risk aspects could be associated with 
 Moderate residual risk. 
Three (3) of the risk aspects 
were attributed Low or Very Low residual risks. 

 22.2.1
 Governing Assumptions 
 The listing of the aspects is 
not presumed to be exhaustive. 
Instead that listing is 
presented based 
 on the experiences of the contributors to the TRS. 

 1.
 The probability and consequence ratings are subjectively assigned, and it is assumed that 
 this subjectivity reasonably reflects the condition of the active and projected mine 
 operations. 
 2.
 The Control Measures shown in the matrices presented in this chapter are 
not exhaustive. 

 They represent a condensed collection of activities that the author of the risk assessment 
 section has observed to be effective in coal mining scenarios. 

 3.
 Mitigation Measures listed for each 
risk factor of the operation are not exhaustive. 
The 
 measures listed, however, 
have been observed by the author to be effective. 

 4.
 The monetary values used in ranking the consequences are generally-accepted quantities 
for 
 the coal mining industry.

 Limitations 
 The risk assessment proposed in 
this report is subject to 
the limitations of the information currently 
 collected, tested, and interpreted 
at the time of the writing of the report. 
 22.2.3
 Methodology 
 The 
numerical 
quantities 
(i.e., 
risk 
levels) 
attributable 
to 
either 
 initial 
or 
 residual 
risks 
are 
 derived 
by the 
product 
of values 
assigned to 
probability 
and consequence 
ranging 
from 
very low 
 risk to very high risk. 
 R = P x C 
 Where: 
 R = Risk Level 
 P = Probability of Occurrence 
 C = Consequence of Occurrence 
 The Probability (P) and 
Consequence (C) parameters recited in the 
formula are subjective numerical 
 estimates 
made 
by 
practiced 
mine 
engineers 
and 
managers. 
Both 
P 
and 
C 
are 
assigned 
integer 
 values 
ranging 
from 
1 
to 
5 
for 
which 
the 
value 
1 
represents 
the 
lowest 
probability 
and 
least 
 consequence, 
and the 
value 5 
represents 
the highest 
probability 
and greatest 
consequence. 
The 
 products (R = P x C) which define the Risk Level, are 
thereafter classified from very low to very high. 
 Risk Level Table 
 Risk Level (R) 
 Very Low (1 to 2) 
 Low (3 to 5) 
 Moderate (6 to 11) 
 High (12 to 19) 
 Very High (20 to 25) 
 Very 
high 
initial 
risks 
are 
considered 
to 
be 
unacceptable 
and 
require 
corrective 
action 
well 
in 
 advance of project 
development. 
In short, 
measures must be 
applied to reduce 
very high initial 
risks 
 to a tolerable level. 

 As 
shown 
and 
discussed 
above, 
after 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
operational, 
technical, 
and 
 administrative actions that have been 
applied or 
are available for action 
when required, the 
residual 
 risk can be determined. 
The residual risk provides 
a basis for the 
management team to determine 
 if the residual risk 
level is acceptable or tolerable. 
If the risk level 
is determined to be unacceptable, 
 further actions should be considered to reduce the residual risk to acceptable or tolerable 
levels to 
 provide justification for continuation 
of the proposed operation. 
 22.2.4
 Development of the Risk Matrix 
 Risks have 
been identified for 
the technical, 
operational, and 
administrative 
subjects addressed 
in 
 the 
TRS. 
The 
risk 
matrix 
and 
risk 
assessment 
process 
are 
modeled 
to 
that 
presented 
in 
the 
 Australian and New Zealand Standard on Risk Management 
(AS/NZS 4360).

 Description of the Coal Property 
 The Mon Valley Reserve (including Pangburn, Shaner and Fallowfield Areas) is located 
in Allegheny, 
 Washington, 
and Westmoreland 
Counties, Pennsylvania. 
Mon Valley 
underground operations 
are 
 projected 
to 
commence 
in 
2032 
at 
the 
Mon 
Valley 
Complex 
in 
the 
large 
Upper 
Freeport 
seam 
 reserve area. 
Three mines are planned, 
and each will 
utilize continuous mining methods. 
The initial 
 operation is designated as the Pangburn Mine; 
subsequently, the Shaner Mine is projected for 2038 
 and followed 
by the 
Fallowfield Mine 
in 2057. 
The operations 
are projected 
to utilize 
continuous 
 mining production 
sections. 
The method 
provides 
continuity, 
preserving skilled 
work groups 
and 
 enabling effective utilization of production equipment. 
The Upper Freeport seam 
is below drainage 
 and therefore 
all mines will be accessed with slopes and shafts.

 Risk Factors 
 A 
high-level 
approach 
is 
utilized 
to 
characterize 
risk 
factors 
that 
are 
generally 
similar 
across 
a 
 number of 
the active 
and proposed 
mining operations. 
Risk factors 
that 
are 
unique to 
a specific 
 operation or are particularly noteworthy are 
addressed individually. 
 22.2.8.1
 Geological and Coal Resource 
 Coal 
mining 
is 
accompanied 
by 
risk 
that, 
despite 
exploration 
efforts, 
mining 
areas 
will 
be 
 encountered 
where geological 
conditions render 
extraction 
of the 
resource to 
be uneconomic, 
or 
 that coal quality characteristics disqualify the product for sale into 
target markets. 
 To 
illustrate these points, the Upper Freeport coal seam deposits at Mon Valley are examined. 
The 
 coal 
is 
deposited 
in 
large, 
elliptical 
pods. 
During 
deposition, 
the 
raised 
peat 
deposits 
were 
 surrounded 
by 
areas 
void 
of 
peat 
and 
deposited 
instead 
with 
dirt, 
clay, 
and 
stream 
channels. 

 Consequently, 
the perimeter 
of the 
peat, 
and consequent 
coal 
deposits may 
contain 
significantly 
 higher concentration of ash 
and sulfur, and reduced product yield. 
The perimeter deposits 
may also 
 be 
affected 
by 
immediate 
roof 
and 
floor 
conditions 
that 
adversely 
affect 
mining 
cost 
and 
 productivity. 
Meandering sandstone 
channels may 
reduce coal 
seam thickness by 
scouring action 
 at the top of the coal seam and support the migration of sulfur to the Upper Freeport seam.

 Offsetting the geological and 
coal resource risk 
are the massive 
size of the 
controlled property which 
 allows 
large 
areas 
to 
be 
mined 
in 
the 
three 
designated 
mine 
areas 
sufficiently 
away 
from 
areas 
 where coal quality 
and mineability 
are less 
favorable. 
In addition, 
the mines 
are designed to 
operate 
 with 
multiple 
production 
sections, 
which 
lessens 
the 
immediate 
impact 
when 
one 
section 
 encounters difficulties. 
The large reserve areas also 
provide a mitigation strategy 
of developing an 
 additional 
(spare) 
section 
at 
each 
mine 
which 
can 
be 
activated 
when 
adverse 
conditions 
are 
 encountered, 
thereby 
maintaining 
consistent 
production 
and quality. 
The 
spare 
section requires 
 additional mine extension cost but increases flexibility and performance consistency.

 The Mon Valley business plan assumes that 75 percent of production can be sold into the favorably 
 priced 
metallurgical 
market. 
The mining 
plan must 
minimize 
exposure 
to the 
perimeter reserves 
 where quality may not be suitable for the market plan and be flexible to manage exposure to 
areas 
 where coal quality fails to meet metallurgica

in mining 
operations. 
Comprehensive training and 
 retraining 
programs, 
internal 
safety 
audits 
and 
examinations, 
regular 
mine

safety 
 meetings, along 
with support 
of trained

are among 
activities 
 that 
greatly 
reduce

 As underground mines are developed and

lead 
to 
modification 
of

 Methane Management 
 Coalbed methane is 
present in coal 
operations below 
drainage. 
Often the methane 
concentration 
 is at such low levels that it can be readily managed with frequent testing and monitoring, vigilance, 
 and routine mine ventilation. 
Very high methane concentrations may be present at greater depths. 

 High methane concentrations may require 
degasification of the coal seam to assure safe mining.

 Mine Fires 
 Mine 
fires,

common 
at 
mine operations, 
are 
rare 
today. 
Most 
active 
coal 
miners 
have 
not 
 encountered a mine 
fire. 
Vastly improved mine power and

with 
 safe 
mine

reduce 
mine 
fire

Crew 
training 
and 
fire

 improve response for containment and

Spontaneous combustion within coal 
 mines, which is the source of most fires that occur today, is not expected to commonly occur at the 
 Coronado 
property. 
When 
spontaneous 
combustion 
conditions 
are 
present, 
monitoring 
systems 
 are employed 
for early 
detection and 
mine plans 
are designed 
to facilitate 
isolation, containment 
 and rapid extinguishment.

Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data 
 Criteria
 JORC Code explanation
 Commentary
 Sampling techniques 
 > 
 Nature and quality of sampling (e.g. cut channels, random chips, or specific specialised 
 industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such 
 as downhole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc.). These examples should not 
 be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling. 
 > 
 Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the appropriate 
 calibration of any measurement tools or systems used. 
 > 
 Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the Public Report. In 
 cases where industry standard work has been done this would be relatively simple (e.g. 
 reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised 
 to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay ). In other cases, more explanation may be required, 
 such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual 
 commodities or mineralisation types (e.g. submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure 
of 
 detailed information. 
 > 
 Most of the coal samples have been obtained from the Properties by subsurface exploration using 
 core drilling techniques. 
The protocol for preparing and testing the samples has varied over time 
 and is not well documented for the older holes drilled on the Properties. 
 > 
 Typical USA core drilling sampling technique is for the coal core sample, once recovered from the 
 core barrel, to be described then wrapped in a sealed plastic sleeve and placed into a covered core 
 box, which is the length of the sample so that the core can be delivered to a laboratory in relatively 
 intact condition and with original moisture content. 
 > 
 It is reasonable to assume, given the sophistication level of the previous operators, that these 
 samples were generally collected and processed under industry best-practices. 
This assumption is 
 based on MM A s familiarity with the operating companies and the companies used to perform 
 the analysis. 

 > 
 Some of the drill holes were air rotary bored and no coal core samples were collected. 
Seam 
 thickness for rotary-drilled bore holes is verified by calibrated downhole gamma-density logs. 

 > 
 Coal samples that were deemed by MM A geologists to be unrepresentative were not used for 
 statistical analysis of coal quality, as documented in the tabulations. A representative group of drill 
 hole samples from the Properties were then checked against the original drill laboratory reports to 
 verify accuracy and correctness. 

 Drilling techniques 
 > 
 Drill type (e.g. core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, 
 sonic, etc.) and details (e.g. core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, 
 face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc.). 
 > 
 The Properties have been extensively explored by subsurface drilling efforts carried out by 
 numerous entities, most of which were completed prior to acquisition by Coronado. 
The majority 
 of the drilling was accomplished using vertical continuous (diamond) coring or air rotary methods. 
 > 
 Core drilling methods utilize NX-size (5.4 centimeter) or similar-sized core cylinders to recover core 
 samples, which can be used to delineate geologic characteristics, and for coal quality testing and 
 geotechnical logging. 

 > 
 Data for the rotary drilled holes is mainly derived from downhole geophysical logs, which are used 
 to interpret coal and rock thickness and depth since logging of the drill cuttings is not reliable. 
 > 
 Geophysical logging was performed on many of the holes, either by Geological Logging Systems (a 
 division of MM A), other geophysical logging contractors, and on those properties acquired from 
 CONSOL geophysical logging was often performed by CONSOL s in-house logging services. 
 Drill sample recovery 
 > 
 Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and results assessed. 
 > 
 Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure representative nature of the 
 samples. 
 > 
 Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and whether sample bias 
 may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material. 
 > 
 Where available, core recovery thickness of coal samples was reconciled with the thickness 
 interpreted from geophysical logs. 
 > 
 Core recovery of the older coal samples lacking geophysical logs is sometimes not well-
 documented: however, when the laboratory results for such holes had anomalous values, the data 
 was disqualified and not used.

 A wide variety of core-logging techniques exist for the properties. 
For many of the core holes, the 
 primary data source is a generalized lithology description by the driller, in some cases 
 supplemented by a more detailed core log completed by a geologist.

 The logging of core thickness and depth is quantitative. 
With the exception of the coal seams, 
 logging of rock strata type is more subjective and best considered as qualitative.

 Typical US practice in the Appalachian Basin is that core samples for deep mineable core samples 
 are not sawn or subsampled (since seams are not of great thickness and the entire seam is mined 
 and co-mingled).

 trenches, mine workings and other locations used in Mineral Resource estimation. 
 > 
 Specification of the grid system used. 
 > 
 Quality and adequacy of topographic control. 
 > 
 Due to the long history of exploration by various parties on the Properties, a wide variety of survey 
 techniques exist for documentation of data point locations. 
Many of the older exploration drill 
 holes appear to have been located by ground survey; more recently completed drill holes are often 
 located by high-resolution Global Positioning System GPS) units. 
 > 
 Grid systems used are typically the State Plane Coordinate System pertinent to each property. 

 > 
 Topography is based on either the USGS topographic 7.5-minute quadrangle maps or on recent 
 aerial photogrammetry as necessary (subject to availability). 
 Data spacing and 
 distribution 
 > 
 Data spacing for reporting of Exploration Results. 
 > 
 Whether the data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish the degree of 
 geological and grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve 
 estimation procedure(s) and classifications applied. 
 > 
 Whether sample compositing has been applied. 
 > 
 Spacing and distribution of data point information may vary from seam to seam within each mining 
 area. 
The areas estimated for coal resource and coal reserve tonnes have been limited so that the 
 data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish the degree of geological continuity 
 appropriate for the estimation and classification of the coal tonnes. 

 > 
 All of the coal resource tonnes are in the measured, indicated, and inferred categories, and all of 
 the coal reserve tonnes are in the proved and probable categories in accordance with the JORC 
 Code and SEC standards. 

 Orientation of data in 
 relation to geological 
 structure 
 > 
 Whether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of possible structures and 
 the extent to which this is known, considering the deposit type. 
 > 
 If the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation of key mineralised 
 structures is considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this should be assessed and 
 reported if material. 
 > 
 Drill holes have been vertically drilled. 
No downhole deviation logs have been collected and it is 
 therefore not known if the drill holes have deviated away from vertical. 
Based on the relatively 
 shallow seam depths, any deviation is expected to be insignificant and immaterial to the geologic 
 characterization of the Property. 
 > 
 The dip of the coal seams is relatively minor and not a material issue for representation of seam 
 thickness or quality. 
 Sample security 
 The measures taken to ensure sample security. 
 > 
 Sample handling procedures employed by explorationists follow typical US protocol and should be 
 adequate to insure sample security. 
 Audits or reviews 
 The results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques and data. 
 > 
 MM A has reviewed all available geological information for the Properties in developing the 
 geologic model. 
Only that data deemed suitable has been used for the purpose of generating the 
 resource and reserve estimates.

 Drill hole Information

 A summary of all information material to the understanding of the exploration results 
 including a tabulation of the following information for all Material drill holes: 
 
 easting and northing of the drill hole collar 
 
 elevation or RL (Reduced Level elevation above sea level in metres) of the drill hole 
 collar 
 
 dip and azimuth of the hole 
 
 down hole length and interception depth 
 
 hole length. 
 > 
 If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is not 
 Material and this exclusion does not detract from the understanding of the report, the 
 Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the case. 
 > 
 MM A reviewed and entered all pertinent data into a digital geologic database for each Coronado 
 property. 
The database consists of thousands of data records, which include drill hole and 
 supplemental coal seam thickness measurements from outcrop and mine exposures. 

 > 
 All drill holes in the database are provided with a collar elevation and the State Plane Coordinate 
 System easting and northing coordinate. 
 > 
 After MM A confirmed proper coal seam thickness and correlation, the seam data was modelled 
 and compiled into coal resource maps. 
 > 
 The maps are provided in the TRS; however, a tabulation of the thousands of individual data 
 records is not practical to include. 
 Data aggregation 
 methods 
 > 
 In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or 
 minimum grade truncations (e.g. cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually 
 Material and should be stated. 
 > 
 Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high grade results and longer 
 lengths of low grade results, the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and 
 some typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail. 
 > 
 The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should be clearly stated. 
 > 
 Where a coal seam has been bench sampled (typically for surface mining) the individual analyses 
 for the coal plies are normally weight-averaged to represent the total of recoverable coal. 
 > 
 Coal quality summary results have been documented in the TRS. 
Average coal quality on a per-
 seam basis is used to represent the coal resources within a given mining area. 
 > 
 Average coal quality for each Coronado complex is provided in Tables 1-1, 1-2 and 1-3 of this TRS. 

 > 
 No other data aggregations methods are used. 
 Relationship between 
 mineralisation widths 
 and intercept lengths 
 > 
 These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration Results. 
 > 
 If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole angle is known, its nature 
 should be reported. 
 > 
 If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a clear 
 statement to this effect (e.g. down hole length, true width not known ). 
 > 
 Coal thickness values from all coal intersections and down hole geophysical logs are considered to 
 be vertical thicknesses. 
Seam dip of approximately 2.0 to 3.0 degrees has little effect on the 
 vertical thickness of the seam. 
 Diagrams 
 > 
 Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be included 
 for any significant discovery being reported These should include, but not be limited to a 
 plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views. 
 > 
 Diagrams and maps showing the coal seam intercepts are presented in the TRS. 
 Balanced reporting 
 > 
 Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, representative 
 reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading 
 reporting of Exploration Results. 
 > 
 All of the available, qualified exploration data has been included within the tabulations, maps, and 
 diagrams for this TRS. 
 > 
 Both coal thickness and quality data are deemed by MM A to be reasonably sufficient within the 
 resource areas. Therefore, there is a reasonable level of confidence in the geologic interpretations 
 required for coal resource determination based on the available data and the techniques applied 
 to the data.

 Description of the Mineral Resource estimate used as a basis for the conversion to an Ore 
 Reserve. 
 > 
 The coal resource estimate was prepared as part of the report Coronado Global Resources Inc. 
 Statement of Coal Resources and Reserves in Accordance with JORC Code and United States SEC 
 Standards as of December 31, 2022 Northern and Central Appalachian Coal Basins Virginia, 
 West Virginia and Pennsylvania, USA February 2023 prepared by MM A. 
 > 
 The resource estimation criteria were developed by MM A based on the capabilities of the mining 
 equipment used within the production model and on industry-accepted standards to assure that 
 the basic geologic characteristics of the coal resources are in reasonable conformity with those to 
 be mined and marketed by Coronado. 
 > 
 Clear statement as to whether the Mineral Resources are reported additional to, or inclusive 
 of, the Ore Reserves. 
 > 
 Coal resources generally are reported inclusive of the coal reserves. 
In some cases, resources are 
 reported in addition to coal reserves. 
Tables 1-1 and 11-3 of the TRS clearly identify resources 
 inclusive of mine plan from which coal reserves were estimated along with those resources 
 exclusive of mine plan from which no reserves were estimated. 

 Site visits 

 > 
 Comment on any site visits undertaken by the Competent Person and the outcome of those 
 visits. 
 > 
 MM A is very familiar with the Properties and has conducted multiple site visits throughout the 
 years.
 Study status 

 > 
 The type and level of study undertaken to enable Mineral Resources to be converted to Ore 
 Reserves. 
 > 
 A preliminary feasibility LOM plan was prepared by MM A for active and proposed mines. 

 > 
 The Code requires that a study to at least Pre-Feasibility Study level has been undertaken to 
 convert Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves. Such studies will have been carried out and will 
 have determined a mine plan that is technically achievable and economically viable, and that 
 material Modifying Factors have been considered. 
 > 
 This geologic evaluation conducted in accordance with JORC and SEC standards and in conjunction 
 with the preliminary feasibility study is sufficient to conclude that the surface, highwall miner and 
 underground coal reserves identified on the Properties are economically mineable under 
 reasonable expectations of market prices for thermal and metallurgical coal products, estimated 
 operation costs, and capital expenditures. 
 > 
 The pre-feasibility financial models, prepared by MM A for this TRS, was developed to test the 
 economic viability of each coal resource area. 
 > 
 Proved and probable coal reserve were derived from the defined in-situ coal resource considering 
 relevant processing, economic (including independent estimates of capital, revenue and cost, 
 marketing, legal, environmental, socioeconomic, and regulatory factors). 
 Cut-off parameters 

 > 
 The basis of the adopted cut-off grade(s) or quality parameters applied. 
 > 
 The cut-off parameters were tailored for each of the Coronado properties to be in accordance with 
 mining/ processing capabilities and market conditions prevalent at each operation. 
 > 
 Examples include minimum recoverable coal thickness, acceptable ash content and wash recovery, 
 and manageable overburden to coal ratio for surface mineable coal. 
 > 
 Details of the parameters are cited within the TRS and included in the table of Cut-off Parameters 
 listed in Section 11.1 of this TRS. 
 > 
 These cut-off parameters have been developed by MM A based on its experience with the 
 Coronado properties and are typical of mining operations in the Central Appalachian coal basin. 

 This experience includes technical and economic evaluations of numerous properties in the region 
 for the purposes of determining the economic viability of the subject coal reserves.

 > 
 The method and assumptions used as reported in the Pre-Feasibility or Feasibility Study to 
 convert the Mineral Resource to an Ore Reserve (i.e. either by application of appropriate 
 factors by optimisation or by preliminary or detailed design). 
 > 
 After validating coal seam data and establishing correlations, the thickness and elevation for seams 
 of economic interest were used to generate a geologic model. 
 > 
 A pre-feasibility LOM plan was prepared by MM A for active and proposed mines. 
MM A 
 prepared mine projections and production timing forecasts based on coal seam characteristics. 

 Production timing was carried out from 2023 to depletion (exhaustion) of the coal reserve areas. 
 > 
 The choice, nature and appropriateness of the selected mining method(s) and other mining 
 parameters including associated design issues such as pre-strip, access, etc. 
 > 
 The room-and-pillar mining method was selected to model the underground mining resources, 
 utilizing continuous miners for coal extraction, shuttle cars for production section haulage and roof 
 bolters for roof control, with the exception that the Buchanan Mine also uses longwall shearers, 
 armored face conveyors, and hydraulic self-advancing roof support. 
The resource areas located 
 above drainage are relatively small and often have irregular boundaries.
 The Buchanan Mine in 
 Buchanan County, Virginia is the only active longwall mine currently being operated by Coronado. 
 > 
 The Coronado underground mining resource areas which are located above-drainage require an 
 access road and mine access development along the outcrop, whereas below-drainage mines are 
 accessed via shaft or slope based on other proposed surface infrastructure locations and/or 
 surface property control. 

 > 
 The surface mining method selected utilizes highly productive hydraulic shovels, front-end loaders, 
 large tractors and rock trucks for overburden removal. 
The mobile equipment spreads adapt 
 readily to winding coal outcrops for contour surface mining and are effective for point-removal 
 and area mining applications. 
 > 
 Application of highwall and auger mining units is an effective method to recover coal resources not 
 suitable for underground mining and under excessive cover for surface mining.

 Coronado must obtain approved mining plans from 
 United States Department of Labor Mine 
 Safety and Health Administration MSHA) 
 that define safety parameters for the highwalls 
 developed during contour and area mining. 
MM A s planning model does not require input of 
 specific highwall design parameters, but provides for timing of mining within mine plan polygons 
 that is representative of the operation performance attained at Central Appalachia surface mines. 
 > 
 Highwall and auger mining is conducted under highwalls designed and constructed to meet MSHA 
 permit requirements. 
To better assure highwall stability and safety 
during highwall coal 
 extraction, MSHA requires that coal fenders, or stumps, be left in place between successive cuts. 
 Periodic barrier pillars must be left in place as an additional safeguard. 
MM A has adjusted the 
 expected mining recovery for highwall and auger mining resources to reflect highwall stability and 
 safety requirements.

 Underground Mining Resources: 
For metallurgical resources, minimum coal seam thickness 
 extends down to between 0.6 and 1.2 meters and a minimum overburden (depth of cover) of 30.5 
 meters. 
A 61-meter horizontal distance is maintained from abandoned mines and sealed or 
 pillared areas, and a 30-meter horizontal distance is maintained from planned highwall miner 
 panels. 
Mine recovery is reduced when a rider coal seam is present within a 1.5- to 3.0-meter

 interval above the coal seam. 
No mining is projected when the interval between overlying and 
 underlying reserves is less than 12 meters. 
 > 
 Surface Mining Resources: 
For classification as a surface-mineable resource, a seam must be at 
 least 0.3 meters in thickness as a stand-alone (principle) seam and 0.15 meters in thickness when 
 less than 0.8 meters from a principal seam. 
The maximum cumulative area mining strip ratio is 
 generally 20:1 for thermal coal and 30:1 for metallurgical coal. 
Some areas were assessed for their 
 economic viability at higher ratios, and were included as reserves if deemed economic. 
For 
 contour surface mining, a minimum of 38-meter bench is provided to support HWM. 
 > 
 HWM and Auger Mining Resources: HWM cut depth (penetration) is established at a maximum of 
 244 meters. 
The minimum mineable coal thickness is limited at 0.6 meters. For coal seams less 
 than 0.8 meters thick, roof and/or floor characteristics must allow OSD cutting to maintain a 0.8-
 meter minimum cutting height.
 Auger mining cut depth is established at an average of 91 meters. 

 The minimum mineable coal thickness is limited at 0.5 meters. 
 > 
 The mining dilution factors used. 
 > 
 Underground Mining Reserves: 
The planning model assigns minimum mining heights of 1.4 to 1.8 
 meters for mains and panel development. 
At the Buchanan Mine, a minimum mining height of 1.8 
 meters was used due to the longwall mining method being employed. 
For coal seams thinner than 
 the assigned mining height, the difference between the coal seam height and assigned mining 
 height consists of OSD. 
In all cases a minimum of 0.05 meters of OSD was assumed, with the 
 exception of the Mon Valley mines, where a minimum 0.15 meters of OSD was assumed due to 
 weaker floor strata. 
 > 
 Surface Mining Reserves: 
Area mining is generally limited to a cumulative overburden ratio of 30:1 
 and a 15:1 ratio for contour mining. 
Exceptions were considered for mining of metallurgical grade 
 coal where deemed economical. 
It is assumed that careful cleaning of exposed coal pits will result 
 in minimal OSD. 
 > 
 HWM and Auger Mining Reserves: 
The mining plan assumes that the HWM cutting height is a 
 minimum of 76 to 99 centimeters for clearance purposes. 
When the coal seam is less than 76 to 
 99 centimeters thick, OSD assumed and included in the ROM product.
 Because the auger has very 
 limited OSD cutting ability, it is assumed that an appropriate auger diameter will be chosen based 
 on the coal seam thickness and that OSD will be minimal. 
 > 
 The mining recovery factors used. 
 > 
 Underground Mining Reserves: 
Mine recovery generally varies between 40 and 60 percent for 
 continuous mining panels, and 100 percent for longwall. 
 > 
 Surface Mining Reserves: 
Mining recovery is 90 percent for virgin areas. 
Mining recovery is 
 reduced where second mining is projected in previously underground and auger mined areas. 
 > 
 HWM and Auger Mining Reserves: 
A mine recovery of 40 percent has been applied for HWM.
 A 
 mine recovery of 35 percent has been applied for auger mining.

 Underground Mining Resources: 
The continuous mining method provides for the extraction of 
 coal from the production faces using continuous miners (and longwall shearing machine at 
 Buchanan) and haulage using shuttle cars or battery haulers to a feeder-breaker located at the tail 
 of the section conveyor belt. 
The feeder-breaker crushes large pieces of coal and rock and 
 regulates coal feed onto the mine conveyor. 
A chain conveyor is used to remove coal from the 
 longwall face at the Buchanan Mine for placement onto the conveyor belt which is ultimately 
 delivered to an underground storage bunker. 
Roof-bolting machines are used to install roof bolts, 
 and battery scoops are available to clean the mine entries and assist in delivery of mine supplies to 
 work areas. 
Surface ventilation fans are installed as needed to provide a sufficient volume of air 
 to ventilate production sections, coal haulage and transport entries, battery charging stations, and 
 transformers in accordance with approved plans. 
 > 
 Coronado currently operates three coal preparation plants, one each at the Buchanan, Logan 
 County and Greenbrier Divisions. 
The Buchanan Plant operates at a feed rate of approximately 
 907 raw tonnes per hour tph), whereas the Saunders Plant (Logan County Division) has a nominal 
 feed rate of 816 tph, and the Mountaineer Plant (Greenbrier Division) operates at 544 tph.
 MM A 
 has included capital estimates for construction of additional coal preparation plants at the Russell 
 County and Mon Valley Complex for the purposes of this TRS. 

 > 
 Surface Mining Resources: The surface mining mobile equipment spreads advance the contour and 
 area mining pits while systematically reclaiming the trailing side of pits where coal has been 
 removed. 
The coal haul roads are extended and maintained as the pits advance. 
Support facilities 
 are maintained nearby but away from the active mining, and include storage areas for blasting 
 agents, fuel and lubricants, and mine supplies along with maintenance facilities and offices. 
Most 
 of the surface mine production is transported to a loading point for crushing, blending and direct-
 shipment to customers. 

 > 
 HWM and Auger Resources: The HWM equipment advances along with the contour mining pits. 

 The rate of advance of the contour mining is governed by the advancement rate of the HWM. 
A 
 diesel-powered generator trails the highwall miner and powers the continuous mining unit. 
Other 
 support facilities are provided along with the contour mining support facilities. 
HWM production 
 is all transported by truck to the coal preparation plant for washing.

was used by MM A to generate mine plans for underground- 
and surface-
 mineable coal seams. 
Underground mine plans were sequenced based on productivity schedules 
 provided by Coronado, which were based on historically achieved productivity levels. 
Surface mine 
 plans were generated under productivity assumptions (bank cubic yard per shift) as provided by 
 Coronado and reviewed by MM A, again based heavily on productivity levels achieved by 
 Coronado. 
All production forecasting ties assumed production rates to geological models as 
 constructed independently by MM A s team of geologists and mining engineers.

 Coronado provided MM A with price forecasts for all Properties. 
Customer coal pricing is derived 
 from market observed forward estimates based on global economic supply and demand analysis 
 which is applied to mine plan sales volumes and product mix and is supplemented with Coronado s 
 in-house knowledge of applicable rail transportation charges, ocean freight charges and port 
 charges. 
Coal price forecasts for the various products were provided by Coronado for various coal 
 markets in terms of US nominal dollars per metric tonne. 
MM A utilized this data for price 
 forecasting in financial modeling.

 On an unlevered basis, the NPV of the project cash flows after taxes was estimated for the purpose 
 of classifying coal reserves. 
The project cash flows, excluding debt service, are calculated by 
 subtracting direct and indirect operating expenses and capital expenditures from revenue. 
Direct 
 costs include labor, drilling and blasting, operating supplies, maintenance and repairs, facilities 
 costs for materials handling, coal preparation, refuse disposal, coal loading, sampling and analysis 
 services, reclamation and general and administrative costs. 
Indirect costs include statutory and 
 legally agreed upon fees related to direct extraction of the mineral. 
The indirect costs are the 
 Federal black lung tax, Federal and State reclamation taxes, property taxes, 
local transportation 
 prior to delivery at rail or barge loading sites, coal production royalties, sales and use taxes, income 
 taxes and State severance taxes. Coronado s 
historical costs provided a useful reference for 
 MM A s cost estimates.

 > 
 MM A performed a previous audit of the Properties in year 2017 for Coronado based on 
 U.S. 
 Securities and Exchange Commission SEC)
 
Industry Guide 7 standards. 
Earlier audits were 
 performed by various independent consultants for predecessors-in-title to Coronado and at 
 various levels of detail depending on the clients concerns and the allotted time for completion. 

 Previous audits and reviews defined the primary coal resource areas and estimated the 
 recoverable tonnes for each seam based on the expected mining methods.

 Additionally, MM A has performed proprietary evaluations for predecessors-in-title to Coronado, 
 which encompass portions of the Properties included in this TRS. 
 Discussion of relative 
 accuracy/ confidence

 Where appropriate a statement of the relative accuracy and confidence level in the Ore 
 Reserve estimate using an approach or procedure deemed appropriate by the Competent 
 Person. For example, the application of statistical or geostatistical procedures to quantify the 
 relative accuracy of the reserve within stated confidence limits, or, if such an approach is not 
 deemed appropriate, a qualitative discussion of the factors which could affect the relative 
 accuracy and confidence of the estimate. 
 > 
 Operations on the Properties by Coronado and its predecessors have been on-going for many 
 years. 

 > 
 MM A is confident that the mine plans and financial models are reasonably representative to 
 provide an accurate estimation of coal reserves. 
 > 
 Mine development and operation have not been optimized within the TRS. 
 > 
 The statement should specify whether it relates to global or local estimates, and, if local, 
 state the relevant tonnages, which should be relevant to technical and economic evaluation. 
 Documentation should include assumptions made and the procedures used. 
 > 
 Proved and probable coal reserve were derived from the defined in-situ coal resource considering 
 relevant processing, economic (including independent estimates of capital, revenue and cost), 
 marketing, legal, environmental, socioeconomic, and regulatory factors on a global scale as current 
 local data reflects the global assumptions. 
 > 
 Accuracy and confidence discussions should extend to specific discussions of any applied 
 Modifying Factors that may have a material impact on Ore Reserve viability, or for which 
 there are remaining areas of uncertainty at the current study stage. 
 The major risk factors for the active Coronado mines and future resource development are 
 summarized below: 
 > 
 Mine Accidents 
 > 
 Highwall Failure. 
Highwall failures are likely to result in a temporary mine closure and should not 
 have a material impact on the mine sustainability. 
The risk is considered to be probable. 

 > 
 Adverse Geological Conditions. 
Adverse geological conditions include such conditions as faults and 
 sandstone washouts. 
The risk is considered to be probable. 
The impact is expected to be 
 temporary with little material impact on mine sustainability. 
 > 
 Environmental Risk. 
Numerous federal and state permits are required to operate coal mines and 
 mine surface facilities. Permitting rules are complex and may change over time, making 
 compliance difficult or impossible.

 > 
 Water Quality. 
Permit requirements to fulfill Clean Water Act obligations are subject to 
 modification. 
The probability of water quality changes having a material impact on mine 
 operations is possible. 
As a contemporary example, the selenium discharge issue that affects 
 western Canadian and Central Appalachian Basin operators has only recently emerged as a 
 concern and its ultimate impact has not been determined. 
 > 
 New Permits. 
Permit protests by environmental groups and individuals can contribute to permit 
 delays or denial and increase the cost of permitting and delay development. 
Surface mining 
 activities, coal refuse disposal and construction of access roads in mountainous terrain often 
 require storage of material in valley fills. 
Authority to dispose of fill material into waters of the 
 United States must be granted by the 
 United States Army Corps of Engineers COE)
 . 
COE permits 
 are increasingly difficult to obtain. 
 > 
 Regulatory Requirements. 
Adverse impact from regulatory changes is considered to be probable. 

 The impact will likely affect the broader industry and is not expected to result in mine closure. 
 > 
 Market Risk. 
Metallurgical and thermal coal markets ultimately depend upon the global steel and 
 thermal coal demand and are considered to be volatile. 
Currently, the US coal market has seen a 
 decline in demand for thermal coal due to thermal plant closures, as a result of new air and water 
 pollution regulations, and competition from other commodities used for power generation such as 
 natural gas. 
This has resulted in an overall decline in CAPP coal production. 
Continued regulatory 
 changes and declining demand could result in material changes in domestic and global coal 
 markets. 
The impact cannot be predicted at this time; however, while MM A expects the coal 
 reserve within this TRS to remain economically viable throughout the life of the projected mines, 
 the LOM financial model is very sensitive to changes in coal sales price and therefore market risk is 
 not insignificant. 
 > 
 Labor Risk. 
Work stoppage due to organized labor protests is considered to be unlikely and not 
 likely to lead to permanent mine closure. 
The mines are likely to suffer the loss of key supervisors 
 and skilled employees due to retirement as the workforce ages. 
The problem is industry-wide and 
 the impact is expected to be temporary and have no sustained impact on coal production. 
 > 
 Availability of Equipment and Supplies. 
Risk of equipment and supply availability is likely to be 
 temporary and should not have a sustained adverse impact on the production of coal. 
 > 
 Transportation Delay. 
Interruption of coal transport services by river or rail is considered to be 
 probable but unlikely to have a sustained impact on coal production. 
 > 
 It is recognised that this may not be possible or appropriate in all circumstances. These 
 statements of relative accuracy and confidence of the estimate should be compared with 
 production data, where available. 
 > 
 Mine plans, productivity expectations and cost estimates generally reflect historical performance 
 and efforts have been made to adjust plans and costs to reflect future conditions.
