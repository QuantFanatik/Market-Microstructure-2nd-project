PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

General 

We are primarily a supplier of original designed and manufactured (ODM) products that include value-added engineering and turn-key solutions. We focus on providing original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and contract electronic manufacturers (CEMs) with ODM products for their multi-year turn-key projects ODM Projects and ODM electronic components ODM Components ). Our product offerings range from discrete semiconductors through small electronic devices. We also distribute brand name electronic components with a vast inventory available on hand. We are incorporated in California and were originally formed in 1989. We maintain two (2) divisions, in Taiwan and China. 

Our Taiwan and China locations provide support for inventory sourcing, purchases and coordinating the manufacture of our ODM Projects and ODM Components (collectively we refer to these as ODM Products ). In 2022 and 2021, we offered approximately 59 and 83, respectively, different ODM Products that are manufactured to specifications developed as a result of our engineering support services. Our China location also serves as the engineering center responsible for making component datasheets and test specifications, arranging pre-production and mass production at our manufacturer partners, preparing samples, monitoring the quality of shipments, performing failure analysis reports, and designing circuits with partners for ODM Projects. 

We have also developed a reputation for stocking a large selection of electronic component inventories to meet the rapid delivery requirements of our customers. At December 31, 2022, our inventory consisted of approximately 12,000 different products manufactured by more than 100 different suppliers. However, our core strategy has shifted to primarily focus on our ODM Products that require custom products designed for specific applications to OEM customers, and away from actively marketing our superstore strategy of maintaining a vast quantity of electronic components to fill customer orders immediately from available stock held in inventory. 

ODM Projects 

Our ODM Projects are custom made and are marketed in specific industries such as: wild animal feeders, timers for DC motors, public street light controllers, LED modules for swimming pools and water fountain lights, LED headlamps for vacuum cleaners, battery testers, universal remote-control devices and battery chargers. 

Our distribution of ODM Projects originates from our 50,000 square-foot facility located in Valencia, California. We utilize a computerized inventory control/tracking system which enables us to quickly access inventory levels and trace product shipments. See Item 2 - Properties.

ODM Product Industry 

ODM product providers have experienced rapid change and growth as an increasing number of OEMs outsource their manufacturing requirements. OEMs have continued to turn to outsourcing in order to reduce product cost; achieve accelerated time-to-market and time-to-volume production; access advanced design and manufacturing technologies; improve inventory management and purchasing power; and reduce their capital investment in manufacturing resources. This enables OEMs to concentrate on what they believe to be their core strengths, such as new product definition, design, marketing and sales. We believe further growth opportunities exist for ODM product providers to penetrate the worldwide market. By designing private brand products for our domestic OEM customers, we are able to expand export sales to overseas CEM customers. 

ODM Products Strategy 

We offer value-added ODM products to our existing OEM and CEM customers utilizing our engineering design center in Shanghai, China. The sales of our ODM Products were 8,282,000 and 8,434,000 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Strategic allies such as Teamforce Co. Ltd., Grand Shine Management and Zowie Technology Corporation (see Part II, Item 8: Note 5 Other Assets) provide us with engineering support services in our ODM projects in order to lower costs and to shorten the design cycle. 

By offering application engineering service to current customers, we are often involved in reviewing their bill of materials (BOMs) and circuit diagrams. Based upon their credit history, type of products, production volume, profitability of the industry and circuit schematics, we offer different solutions for quality improvement, additional functions and cost savings throughout the re-design processes such as component replacement, digital circuit instead of analog circuit, microprocessor instead of logic circuit, integrated circuit instead of discrete components. Our preference is to target low but increasing volume, high margin, stable demand, profitable and specialty products, and financially stable customers who know how to market their products. Our strengths are in microprocessor programming, power supply, power management, LED message sign, RF transmission and receiving, encoders and decoders, remote controllers, DC motor control and power amplifiers. In many cases, we have been able to take advantage of our component distribution capability by using current stock to reduce lead time and choosing the low-cost components we currently sell. We depend on our outsourcing partners in mold design, plastic injection, metal stamping, wire hardness and final assembly. We ask between 15 to 30 down payment before accepting a purchase order and offer customers 30 to 60 days payment terms. All purchasing orders must have a firm delivery schedule under a non-cancelable and non-returnable (NCNR) agreement. To reduce the manufacturing and handling cost, we arrange production of the same model once a year and keep product in our warehouse to be released according to the predetermined schedule. 

Superstore Marketing Strategy Change 

Since 1997, we have marketed ourselves as the discrete components superstore, with an in-depth focus on discrete semiconductors, passive and optoelectronic components and extensive inventory of a wide variety of these products. Our superstore strategy consists of carrying a large quantity and variety of components in inventory to meet the rapid delivery requirements of our customers. Our core strategy has shifted to primarily focus on our ODM Products that require custom services designed for specific applications to OEM customers, and away from actively marketing our superstore strategy of maintaining a vast quantity of electronic components to fill customer orders immediately from available stock held in inventory. We will continue offering our existing wide variety of components for resale, but these products will be more passively marketed and distributed online for clearance through our website shopping portal, instead of actively through traditional sales agents and distributors. 

Customers 

We market our ODM products to OEMs and our electronic components inventory to distributors, OEMs and CEMs. During each of 2022 and 2021, we distributed our products to approximately 200 customers, however our two largest customers combined accounted for approximately 70 (individually by approximately 46 and 24 of net sales during 2022 and approximately 59 (individually by approximately 41 and 18 during 2021. 

We believe that exceptional customer service and customer relations are key elements of our success, and train our sales force to provide prompt, efficient and courteous service to all customers. See Business - Sales and Marketing Channels. We have the ability to ship most orders the same day they are placed and, historically, most of our customers orders have been shipped within the requested delivery schedule.

Sales and Marketing Channels 

As of March 15, 2023, our sales and marketing department consisted of 6 employees. We have centralized our sales order processing and customer service department into our headquarters at Valencia, California. 

As a result of our marketing strategy change to focus primarily on ODM Products and away from our superstore inventory, we expect our remaining components inventory will be more passively marketed and distributed online for clearance through our internet sales portal, however at potentially lower rates due to the pricing pressures normally attributed with online shopping. 

Suppliers 

In connection with our ODM products, we have built strong collaborative relationships with a few selected system integration companies in China. These strategic relationships ensure the quality of the products and services and also provide a warranty on our finished products. Most of the projects involve multiple years of cooperation among components suppliers, overseas partners and the end customers in the US, and therefore, increase business stability and reduce the financial risk of excess inventory. 

We believe that it s important to develop and maintain good relationships with our discrete electronic component suppliers, since we do not have long-term supply, distribution or franchise agreements with any of our suppliers. Instead, we cultivate strong working relationships with each of our suppliers. 

Competition 

The ODM products we provide are available from many independent sources as well as from the in-house manufacturing capabilities of current and potential customers. Our competitors may be more established in the industry and have substantially greater financial, manufacturing, or marketing resources than we do. In addition, in recent years, original design manufacturers that provide design and manufacturing services to OEMs have significantly increased their share of outsourced manufacturing services provided to OEMs in the consumer electronic product market. Competition from ODMs may increase if our business in these markets grows or if ODMs expand further into these markets. We believe that our principal competitive advantages in our targeted markets are our engineering capabilities, product quality, flexibility, cost and timeliness in responding to design and schedule changes, reliability in meeting product delivery schedules, pricing, technological sophistication and geographic location. 

We operate our discrete electronic components business online in a highly competitive environment and face competition from numerous local, regional and national distributors (both in purchasing and selling inventory) and electronic component manufacturers, including some of our own suppliers. Many of our competitors are more established and have greater name recognition and financial and marketing resources than us. 

Management Information Systems 

We have made a significant investment in computer hardware, software and personnel. The Management Information Systems (MIS) department is responsible for software and hardware upgrades, maintenance of current software and related databases, and designing custom systems. We believe that our MIS department is crucial to our success and believe in continually upgrading our hardware and software. We also developed a vendor management inventory software program which allows participating customers to access and manage their own inventory through the internet. The web site also provides users with other current information about us. 

Warehouse Management System 

We utilize a wireless, fully bar-coded warehouse perpetual inventory tracking system that greatly enhances the processing speed, accuracy of product quantity and location control within the warehouse. It also reduces potential errors and accelerates the delivery of components to our customers. We continuously improve our warehouse management system with custom programming features. 

Foreign Trade Regulation 

A large portion of the products we distribute are manufactured in Asia, including Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, China, South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines. The purchase of goods manufactured in foreign countries is subject to a number of risks, including economic disruptions, including the ongoing consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, transportation delays and interruptions, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, imposition of tariffs and import and export controls, and changes in governmental policies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Table of Contents 

Sales to Asian customers were 3.6 and 9.8 of our total sales in 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

From time to time, protectionist pressures have influenced U.S. trade policy concerning the imposition of significant duties or other trade restrictions upon foreign products. We cannot predict whether additional U.S. customs quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions will be imposed upon the importation of foreign components in the future or what effect any of these actions would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. During 2022, we remained impacted by tariff costs on certain products imported from China, which went into effect as of July 6, 2018. However, we also have been able to pass along a portion of these costs to our customers to mitigate these costs. 

Our ability to remain competitive with respect to the pricing of imported components could be adversely affected by increases in tariffs or duties, changes in trade treaties, strikes in air or sea transportation, and possible future U.S. legislation with respect to pricing and import quotas on products from foreign countries. For example, it is possible that political or economic developments in China, or with respect to the United States relationship with China, could have an adverse effect on our business. Our ability to remain competitive also could be affected by other governmental actions related to, among other things, anti-dumping legislation and international currency fluctuations. While we do not believe that any of these factors adversely impact our business at present, we cannot assure that these factors will not materially adversely affect us in the future. Any significant disruption in the delivery of merchandise from our suppliers, substantially all of whom are foreign, could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 

Employees 

As of March 15, 2023, we had 15 employees, all of whom are employed on a full-time basis. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relations with employees to be good. 

Website Availability of Our Reports Filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 

We maintain a website (http://www.taitroncomponents.com), but we are not including the information contained on this website as a part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this annual report on Form 10-K. We make available free of charge through this website our annual reports, quarterly reports and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file that material with, or furnish the material to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 

Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, before deciding to invest in our common shares. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. 

If our suppliers fail to meet our component and manufacturing needs, it could delay our production and our product shipments to customers and negatively affect our operations. 

Our ODM Products comprise many components and subassemblies produced by outside suppliers. We depend greatly on these suppliers for items that are essential to the manufacture of our products, including printed circuit boards and integrated circuits. For certain items, we qualify only a single source, which magnifies the risk of shortages and decreases our ability to negotiate with that supplier on the basis of price. From time to time, we have been unable to obtain sufficient components that we have needed due to shortages or quality issues from some of our suppliers. If our suppliers fail to meet our manufacturing needs, it would delay our production and our product shipments to customers and negatively affect our operations. 

Our primary suppliers are located in Asia. If a manufacturer should be unable to deliver products to us on a timely basis or at all, our business could be adversely affected. Though we have had many years of favorable experience with these suppliers, there can be no assurance that circumstances might not change and compel one or more of these suppliers to curtail or terminate deliveries to us. Moreover, the use of contract manufacturers to provide components typically requires that we place production orders several months in advance of our expected need for the products. This in turn leads to risks that we may lack sufficient inventory to sell to our customers where our expectations were conservative, or that we may order excess product inventory where our expectations were optimistic. We have in the past, experienced shortages of some parts needed to manufacture our ODM Products.

In addition, since a significant number of the products we distribute are manufactured in Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, South Korea and the Philippines, we are subject to a number of risks associated with foreign operations, including economic disruptions, transportation delays and interruptions, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, imposition of tariffs and import and export controls and changes in governmental policies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

The company's lack of long-term sales contracts may have a material adverse effect on its business. 

Most of the company's sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts. The company generally works with its customers to develop non-binding forecasts for future orders. Based on such non-binding forecasts, the company makes commitments regarding the level of business that it will seek and accept, the inventory that it purchases, and the levels of utilization of personnel and other resources. A variety of conditions, both specific to each customer and generally affecting each customer's industry may cause customers to cancel, reduce, or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated, file for bankruptcy protection, or default on their payments. Generally, customers may cancel, reduce, or delay purchase orders and commitments without penalty. The company seeks to mitigate these risks, in some cases, by entering into noncancelable/nonreturnable sales agreements, but there is no guarantee that such agreements will adequately protect the company. Significant or numerous cancellations, reductions, delays in orders by customers, loss of customers, and/or customer defaults on payments could materially adversely affect the company's business. 

Changes in demand or downturns in the markets we serve could affect our business and operating results. 

The industries into which we market and sell our products are cyclical and may experience downturns. These industries also experience volatility, and future volatility as well as downturns, or any failure of these industries to recover from downturns, could materially harm our business and operating results. In addition, our business and financial position may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions that cause a decline in business and consumer spending in the markets served by our or our customers products. 

The competitive pressures the company faces, such as pricing and margin reductions, could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. 

The company operates in a highly competitive international environment. The company competes with other large multinational and national electronic components and enterprise computing solutions distributors, as well as numerous other smaller, specialized competitors who generally focus on narrower market sectors, products, or industries. The company also competes for customers with its suppliers. The size of the company's competitors varies across market sectors, as do the resources the company has allocated to the sectors in which it does business. Therefore, some of the company's competitors may have a more extensive customer and/or supplier base than the company in one or more of its market sectors. There is significant competition within each market sector and geography that creates pricing and margin pressure and the need for constant attention to improve service and product offerings and increase market share. Other competitive factors include rapid technological changes, product availability, credit availability, speed of delivery, ability to tailor solutions to changing customer needs, and quality and depth of product lines and training, as well as service and support provided to the customer. The company also faces competition from companies in the logistics and product fulfillment, catalog distribution, and e-commerce supply chain services markets. The company expects to encounter increased competition from its current and/or new competitors, making it more difficult for the company to retain its market share. There is no guarantee that the company's response to competition will be successful. The company's failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could have a material adverse effect on its business. 

A small number of suppliers and customers account for a significant portion of the company s business. 

Grand Shine Electronics and Zowie Technology (see also Item 8 - Note 5 Other Assets) together accounted for approximately 49.1 and 45.7 of our net purchases for each of the fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. We do not regard any one supplier as essential to our operations, since equivalent replacements for most of our products are available from one or more of our other suppliers or are available from various other sources at competitive prices. However, a change in supplier may delay the delivery of our inventory and adversely impact our results of operations. 

In 2022, we had two customers accounting for more than 10 of our net sales, for approximately 46 and 24 . In 2021, we had two customers accounting for more than 10 of our net sales, for approximately 41 and 18 . As of December 31, 2022, we had one customers accounting for more than 10 of our trade accounts receivable, net of allowances, of approximately 78 and as of December 31, 2021 we had two customers of approximately 39 and 37 . In the event our largest customers were to decrease their demand for our products or in the event such customers ceased to purchase products from us, our operations would be materially and adversely impacted.

The company may not be able to adequately anticipate, prevent, or mitigate damage resulting from criminal and other illegal or fraudulent activities committed against it. 

Global businesses are facing increasing risks of criminal, illegal, and other fraudulent acts. The evolving nature of such threats, considering new and sophisticated methods used by criminals, including phishing, misrepresentation, social engineering and forgery, is making it increasingly difficult for the company to anticipate and adequately mitigate these risks. In addition, designing and implementing measures to defend against, prevent, and detect these types of activities are increasingly costly and invasive into the operations of the business. As a result, the company could experience a material loss in the future to the extent that controls and other measures implemented to address these threats fail to prevent or detect such acts. 

Products sold by the company may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty and/or product liability claims may be asserted against the company, which may have a material adverse effect on the company. 

The company's business could be materially adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in the products or components sold by the company. Despite our efforts to revise and update our manufacturing and test processes, we may not be able to control and eliminate manufacturing flaws adequately. These flaws may include undetected software or hardware defects associated with new products, existing products or products that haves been integrated into a system or apparatus with the products of other vendors. If we fail to adequately monitor, develop and implement appropriate test and manufacturing processes we could experience a rate of product failure that results in substantial shipment delays, warranty costs or damage to our reputation. Product flaws may also consume our limited engineering resources and interrupt our development efforts. Significant product failures would increase our costs and result in the loss of future sales and be harmful to our business. 

Declines in value of the company's inventory could materially adversely affect its business. 

The market for the company's products and services is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in end-market demand, evolving customer expectations, oversupply of product, and regulatory requirements, which can contribute to the decline in value or potential obsolescence of inventory. Many of the company's suppliers will not allow products to be returned after they have been held in inventory beyond a certain amount of time, and, in most instances, the return rights are limited to a certain percentage of the amount of product the company purchased in a particular time frame. As we continue to shift our primary focus to our ODM Products and away from actively marketing our superstore strategy of maintaining a vast quantity of electronic components to fill customer orders immediately from available stock held in inventory, we expect the value of our existing inventory to decline. We had inventory balances in the amount of 3,900,000 and 5,261,000 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which is presented net of valuation allowances of 5,069,000 and 4,892,000 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Further declines in the value of the company s inventory could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. 

Tariffs may result in increased prices and could adversely affect the company's business and results of operations. 

Recently, the U.S. government imposed tariffs on certain products imported into the U.S. and the Chinese government imposed tariffs on certain products imported into China, which have increased the prices of many of the products that the company purchases from its suppliers. The tariffs, along with any additional tariffs or trade restrictions that may be implemented by the U.S., China or other countries, could result in further increased prices. While the company intends to pass price increases on to its customers, the effect of tariffs on prices may impact sales and results of operations. Retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods have not yet had a significant impact, but the company cannot predict further developments. The tariffs and the additional operational costs incurred in minimizing the number of products subject to the tariffs could adversely affect the operating profits of the company and customer demand for certain products which could have an adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations. 

The company is subject to U.S. and certain foreign export and import controls, sanctions, embargoes, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. In the event of non-compliance, the company can face serious consequences, which can harm its business. 

The company is subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations EAR ), U.S. Customs regulations, various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Controls OFAC ). Products the company sells which are either manufactured in the United States or based on U.S. technology ("U.S. Products") are subject to the EAR when exported and re-exported to and from all international jurisdictions, in addition to the local jurisdiction's export regulations applicable to individual shipments. Licenses or proper license exemptions may be required by local jurisdictions' export regulations, including EAR, for the shipment of certain U.S. Products to certain countries, including China, and other countries in which the company operates. Non-compliance with the EAR, OFAC regulations, or other applicable export regulations can result in a wide range of penalties including the denial of export privileges, fines, criminal penalties, and the seizure of inventories. In the event that any export regulatory body determines that any shipments made by the company violate the applicable export regulations, the company could be fined significant sums and/or its export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.

Further, the company is also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. 201, and other state and national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which it conducts business. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, contractors, and other collaborators from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything else of value to recipients in the public or private sector. The company engages third parties to provide services. The company can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of its employees, agents, and contractors, even if it does not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. Any violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences to the company. 

The company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could materially adversely affect its business. 

A number of jurisdictions in which the company's products are sold have enacted laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, and other related matters. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of the company's products and impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters. Failure to comply with these laws or any other applicable environmental regulations could result in fines or suspension of sales. Additionally, these directives and regulations may result in the company having non-compliant inventory that may be less readily salable or have to be written off. Some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from the company's currently or formerly owned, leased, or operated property, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination. The presence of environmental contamination could also interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect the company's ability to sell or lease its properties. The discovery of contamination for which the company is responsible, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existing regulations are enforced, could require the company to incur costs for compliance or subject it to unexpected liabilities, which could be material. 

The company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources. 

The company requires cash for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital, acquisitions, and capital expenditure needs. At December 31, 2022, the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 5.2 million. The company believes that funds generated from operations, existing cash balances and, if necessary, related party short-term loans, are likely to be sufficient to finance its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future. If these funds are not sufficient, the company may need to secure new sources of asset-based lending on accounts receivables or issue debt or equity securities. In the event the company requires additional capital to meet its business needs, there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. 

The company s revenues and operating results may fluctuate unexpectedly from quarter to quarter, which may in turn affect its stock price. 

The company s quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past, and are likely to vary in the future due to the various factors, including: 

General economic conditions affecting spending and the rates of growth or decline in the markets the company services; including changes caused by COVID-19 and variants of the virus, rising inflation, and the ongoing war in Europe. 

Variations in product order backlogs, and reductions in the size, delays in the timing, or cancellation of significant customer orders; 

The timing of introductions and marketplace acceptance of new or enhanced products by the company or its competitors; 

Expansions or reductions in the company s relationships with its OEM customers; 

Unforeseen warranty costs that exceed established reserves; 

Timing and levels of the company s operating expenses; or 

Emerging new technologies that change the nature of or need for the company s products and components held in inventory. 

We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be reliable indicators of our future performance. It is likely that in some future period our operating results will not meet your expectations or those of public market analysts. Any unanticipated change in revenues or operating results is likely to cause the company s stock price to fluctuate since such changes reflect new information available to investors and analysts. New information may cause investors and analysts to revalue the company s stock and this, in the aggregate, may cause fluctuations in the company s stock price.

If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discovers material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on its business. 

An effective internal control environment is necessary for the company to produce reliable financial reports, safeguard assets, and is an important part of its effort to prevent financial fraud. The company is required to annually evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internal controls over financial reporting. Based on these evaluations, the company may conclude that enhancements, modifications, or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable. While management evaluates the effectiveness of the company's internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment. In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate financial statement risk. If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or the company's independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in the company's internal controls, it may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. In addition, the company may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or NASDAQ. Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of the company's financial statements, which could cause the market price of its common stock to decline or limit the company's access to capital. 

The company's success depends upon its key executives. 

Any failure to attract and retain necessary talent may materially and adversely affect the company's business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. The company's success depends, to a significant extent, on the capability, expertise, and continued services of its senior management team. The company relies on the expertise and experience of certain key executives in developing business strategies, business operations, and maintaining relationships with customers and suppliers. If the company were to lose any of its key executives, it may not be able to find a suitable replacement with comparable knowledge and experience. The company may also need to offer better remuneration and other benefits to attract and retain key executives and therefore cannot be assured that costs and expenses will not increase significantly as a result of increased talent acquisition and retention cost. 

Cyber security and privacy breaches may hurt the company's business, damage its reputation, increase its costs, and cause losses. 

The company's information technology systems could be subject to invasion, cyber-attack, or data privacy breaches by employees, others with authorized access, and unauthorized persons. Such attacks could result in disruption to the company's operations and/or loss or disclosure of, or damage to, the company's or any of its customer's or supplier's data, confidential information, or reputation. The company's information technology systems security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or suppliers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the company's data and information technology systems. Any such breach could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to the company's reputation, loss of competitive advantage, and a loss of confidence in the security of the company's information technology systems that could potentially have an impact on the company's business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade, or sabotage the company's information technology systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched, the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Further, third parties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services for the company's operations, could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure. 

The company makes investments seeking to address risks and vulnerabilities, including ongoing monitoring, updating networks and systems, and personnel awareness training of potential cybersecurity threats to help ensure employees remain diligent in identifying potential risks. In addition, the company has deployed monitoring capabilities to support early detection, internal and external escalation, and effective responses to potential anomalies. As part of the company's review of potential risks, the company analyzes emerging cyber security threats as well as the company's plan and strategies to address them. Although the company has developed systems and processes that are designed to protect information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach, such measures cannot provide absolute security. Such breaches, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in the company incurring costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, defending against litigation, including litigation brought by governmental authorities, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, or taking other remedial steps. Also, global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment. The company's failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others and other fines or penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business.

The company relies heavily on its internal information systems, which, if not properly functioning, could materially adversely affect the company's business. 

The company's current global operations reside on multiple technology platforms. The size and complexity of the company's computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, and random attack. To date, the company has not experienced any identifiable significant issues. Failure to properly or adequately address any unaccounted for or unforeseen issues could impact the company's ability to perform necessary business operations, which could materially adversely affect the company's business. 

The company may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees and could limit the company's ability to use certain technologies in the future. 

Certain of the company's products and services include intellectual property owned primarily by the company's third party suppliers and, to a lesser extent, the company itself. Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the business in which the company operates. From time to time, third parties (including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents not for the purpose of developing technology but with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers) may assert patent, copyright and/or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company's business. In some cases, depending on the nature of the claim, the company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that the company is fully protected against such claims. In addition, the company is exposed to potential liability for technology that it develops itself or when it combines multiple technologies of its suppliers for which it may have limited or no indemnification protections. In any dispute involving products or services that incorporate intellectual property from multiple sources or is developed, licensed by the company, or obtained through acquisition, the company's customers could also become the targets of litigation. The company may be obligated in certain instances to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the company sells are alleged to infringe any third party's intellectual property rights. Any infringement claim brought against the company, regardless of the duration, outcome, or size of damage award, could result in substantial cost to the company; divert management s attention and resources, be time consuming to defend, result in substantial damages or awards or cause product shipment delays. 

Additionally, if an infringement claim is successful, the company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase the company's operating expenses and harm the company's operating results and financial condition. Also, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all. The company may have to stop selling certain products or using technologies, which could affect the company's ability to compete effectively. 

Public health threats could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results. 

Public health threats, including COVID-19, could adversely affect the company s ongoing business operations. The outbreak of COVID-19 has severely impacted global economic activity and caused significant volatility in financial markets. The global impact of the outbreak has been rapidly evolving and many countries, including the United States, have reacted by instituting quarantines, mandating business and school closures and restricting travel. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting almost every industry directly or indirectly. The company cannot predict the scope and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions, including any future shutdowns relating to COVID-19, but if the company or any of the third parties with whom it engages, including its suppliers, were to experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, the company s ability to conduct its business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and its results of operation and financial condition. 

Trading in the company s stock has historically been limited and the company s stock price has been volatile, which may affect your ability to sell your shares. 

The average trading volume in the company s stock has been historically low, with little or no trading at all on some days. This, as well as other factors, has caused the price of the company s stock to be volatile. Consequently, it may be difficult to sell your shares of the company s stock at the price you paid for them or at a price equal to that quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market. In addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume volatility recently. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many smaller public companies for reasons frequently unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the specific companies. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements as a result of many important factors, including those set forth in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption Risk Factors. Please see Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in Part I above. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Annual Report. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, appearing in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Use of Estimates We have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. These estimates have a significant impact on our valuation and reserve accounts relating to the allowance for sales returns and allowances, doubtful accounts, inventory reserves and deferred income taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized at the point at which control of the underlying products are transferred to the customer. Satisfaction of our performance obligations occur upon the transfer of control of products, either from our facilities or directly from suppliers to customers. We consider customer purchase orders to be the contracts with a customer. All revenue is generated from contracts with customers. Reserves for sales allowances and customer returns are established based upon historical experience and our estimates of future returns. Sales returns for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 0 and 1,000, respectively. The allowance for sales returns and allowances and doubtful accounts at December 31, 2022 and 2021 aggregated 7,000. We review the actual sales returns and bad debts for our customers and establish an estimate of future returns and an allowance for doubtful accounts. 

Inventory - Inventory, consisting principally of products held for resale, is recorded at the lower of cost (determined using the first in-first out method) and net realizable value. We had inventory balances in the amount of 3,900,000 and 5,261,000 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which is presented net of valuation allowances of 5,069,000 and 4,892,000 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We increased our reserves by 180,000 and 150,000 during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, while also applying 3,000 and 17,000 of our existing reserves to the underlying inventory values during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We evaluate inventories to identify excess, high-cost, slow-moving or other factors rendering inventories as unmarketable at normal profit margins. Due to the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing and maintaining a large inventory of product offerings, estimates are made regarding adjustments to the cost of inventories. If our assumptions about future demand change, or market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional write-downs of inventories may be required. In any case, actual amounts could be different from those estimated. 

Deferred Taxes If determined that it is more likely than not that we will not realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets, which allowance will be charged to income tax expense in the period of such determination. We also consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies and future taxable income in assessing if deferred tax assets could be realized. We also consider the weight of both positive and negative evidence in determining whether a valuation allowance is needed. However, we have fully reduced by 1,915,000 the entire valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets during the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily as a result of our recent history of net income. In prior years, due to a period of consistent losses through December 31, 2016 coupled with the current uncertainty with COVID-19 and recent world events, we had fully reserved a 1,915,000 allowance against our net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2021. 

Overview 

We are primarily focused on supplying ODM products for our OEM customer s multi-year turn-key projects. We also distribute discrete semiconductors, commodity Integrated Circuits (ICs), optoelectronic devices and passive components to other electronic distributors, CEMs and OEMs, who incorporate them in their products. 

Our core strategy has shifted to primarily focus on higher margin ODM Projects that require custom products designed for specific applications to OEM customers, and away from actively marketing our superstore strategy of maintaining a vast quantity of electronic components to fill customer orders immediately from available stock held in inventory. As a result, we expect our components inventory will be more passively marketed and distributed online for clearance through our internet sales portal, however at potentially lower rates due to the pricing pressures normally attributed with online shopping. In 2022, we recorded a 180,000 increase to our inventory reserves. 

15

Table of Contents 

In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have classified inventory as a current asset in our December 31, 2022, consolidated financial statements representing approximately 32.6 of current assets and 22.8 of total assets. However, if all or a substantial portion of the inventory was required to be immediately liquidated, the inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included or classified as a current asset, such as cash. We cannot assure you that demand in the discrete semiconductor market will increase and that market conditions will improve. Therefore, it is possible that further declines in our carrying values of inventory may result. 

Our gross profit margins are subject to a number of factors, including product demand, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, provisions for inventory reserves, our ability to purchase inventory at favorable prices and our sales product mix. 

Results of Operations 

The Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021 

Net sales were 8,423,000 and 8,643,000 in 2022 and 2021, respectively, representing a decrease of 220,000 or 2.5 . The decrease was primarily in ODM Projects and owing to lower demand. Key customers of our ODM Projects have variable life cycles and production demands. As some projects are accelerating and others approach end of life, the timing of new production creates a fluctuation in sales. In 2023, we expect sales to decline, due to some of our customers building inventory during the pandemic which has reduced demand. 

Gross profit was 4,393,000 and 4,121,000 in 2022 and 2021, respectively, which represented 52.2 and 47.7 of net sales for those periods. During 2022, we remained impacted by tariff costs on certain products imported from China, which went into effect as of July 6, 2018. However, we continue to pass along a portion of these costs to our customers to mitigate these costs. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses were 2,158,000 and 2,029,000 in 2022 and 2021, respectively, which represented 25.6 and 23.5 of net sales for those periods. The year-over-year increase of 129,000 was primarily due to personnel costs. 

Operating income was 2,235,000 and 2,092,000 in 2022 and 2021, respectively, which represented 26.5 and 24.2 of net sales for those periods. 

Net interest income, primarily earned from certificates of deposits in banks was 40,000 and 19,000 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Income tax benefit(provision) was 1,382,000 and 388,000) in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease was primarily due fully reducing by 1,915,000 the entire valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. 

As result of the foregoing, we recognized net income of 3,208,000 and 2,010,000 in 2022 and 2021, respectively, which represented 38.1 and 23.3 of net sales for those periods. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We historically have satisfied our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations, short-term commercial loans, subordinated related party promissory notes and issuance of equity securities. A summary of our cash flows resulting from our operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:

Cash provided by operating activities decreased to 1,691,000 during 2022, as compared to 1,741,000 in the prior year. The 50,000 decrease was primarily due to changes in inventory, accounts receivable, deferred income taxes, accounts payable and net income.

Table of Contents 

Cash used for investing activities was 968,000 during 2022, as compared to 1,523,000 in the prior year. The decrease was from purchase of short-term investments (see also Item 8 - Note 1 Short-term Investments). 

Cash used in financing activities was 1,495,000 during 2022, as compared to 889,000 in the prior year. In 2022, we made dividend payments of 1,703,000 and received proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 208,000. In 2021, we made dividend payments of 965,000 and received proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 76,000. 

We believe that funds generated from operations, existing cash balances and short-term investments and, if necessary, related party short-term loans, are likely to be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future. If these funds are not sufficient, we may secure new sources of asset-based lending on accounts receivables or issue debt or equity securities. Otherwise, we may need to liquidate assets to generate the necessary working capital. 

Inventory is included and classified as a current asset. As of December 31, 2022, inventory represented approximately 32.6 of current assets and 22.8 of total assets. However, it is likely to take over one (1) year for the inventory to turn and therefore is likely not saleable within a one (1) year time frame. Hence, inventory would not be as readily marketable or liquid as other items included in current assets, such as cash.

We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are likely to have, a current or future material effect on our operations.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Board of Directors 

Taitron Components Incorporated 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statement 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Taitron Components Incorporated (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, shareholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended and the related notes to consolidated financial statements (collectively, the consolidated financial statements ). 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Security and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical audit matters 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Assessment of reserves for slow-moving or potential obsolescence 

As discussed in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company assesses the valuation of its inventories, which principally consists of products held for resale, each reporting period. Slow-moving inventory or inventory with potential obsolescence is written down to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost. Estimates of slow-moving or potential obsolescence include the Company s analysis of anticipated demand, possible alternative uses of its inventory, as well as other qualitative factors. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s inventories totaled 3,900,000, net of reserves for slow-moving or potential obsolescence of 5,069,000. 

We identified the assessment of the value of the reserves for slow-moving or potential obsolescence as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company s estimates of anticipated demand and possible alternative uses of its inventory, which are affected by market and economic conditions outside the Company s control. 

The primary procedures we performed to address the critical audit matter included, among other things, the following: 1) evaluation of the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the estimate of the reserve; 2) development of an independent estimate of the reserve using historical information and compared it to management s reserve; and 3) comparison of the reserve as of December 31, 2022 to the actual reserve recorded subsequent to the measurement date. 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2020.

Our investment represents approximately of their total outstanding shares although we do not have significant influence or control. This investment is accounted for under the cost (plus impairment) basis of accounting, however when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of this asset may not be recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were effective such that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 

a) Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for the Company. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent nor detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 

Our internal controls framework is based on the criteria set forth in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Based on such criteria, our management, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that it was effective as of December 31, 2022. 

As a smaller reporting company, management's assessment of our internal control over financial reporting is not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm and as such, no attestation was performed by our independent registered public accounting firm. 

b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred in our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
