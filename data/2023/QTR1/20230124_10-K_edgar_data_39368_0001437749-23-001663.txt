PART I 
 
 Item 1. Business 
 
 H.B. Fuller Company was founded in 1887 and incorporated as a Minnesota corporation in 1915. Our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE under the ticker symbol FUL. As used herein, H.B. Fuller , we , us , our , management or company includes H.B. Fuller and its subsidiaries unless otherwise indicated. Where we refer to 2022, 2021 and 2020 herein, the reference is to our fiscal years ended December 3, 2022, November 27, 2021, and November 28, 2020, respectively. 
 
 We are a leading worldwide formulator, manufacturer and marketer of adhesives, sealants and other specialty chemical products. Sales operations span 34 countries in North America, Europe, Latin America, the Asia Pacific region, India, the Middle East and Africa. Industrial adhesives represent our core product offering, which help improve the performance of our customers products or improve their manufacturing processes. Customers use our adhesives products in manufacturing common consumer and industrial goods, including food and beverage containers, disposable diapers, medical products, windows, doors, appliances, sportswear, footwear, multi-wall bags, water filtration products, insulation, textiles, automobiles, recreational vehicles, buses, trucks and trailers, marine products, solar energy systems, electronics and products for the aerospace and defense industries. In addition, we have established a variety of product offerings for residential, commercial and industrial construction markets, including sealing and waterproofing solutions for airports, roads, highways, bridges, and utilities; pressure-sensitive adhesives, tapes and sealants for the commercial roofing industry; and level-setting products, ready-to-use grouts, mortars, and pressure sensitive adhesives that enable contractors and do-it-yourself consumers to quickly install flooring and tiling applications more reliably and efficiently. We also provide our customers with technical support and unique solutions designed to address their specific needs. 
 
 We have three reportable segments: Hygiene, Health and Consumable Adhesives, Engineering Adhesives and Construction Adhesives. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (the MD A in Item 7 of this Annual Report for a description of our segment operating results. 
 
 Non-U.S. Operations 
 
 The principal markets, products and methods of distribution outside the United States vary with each of our regional operations generally maintaining integrated business units that contain dedicated supplier networks, manufacturing, logistics and sales organizations. The vast majority of the products sold within any region are produced within the region, and the respective regions do not import significant amounts of product from other regions. As of December 3, 2022, we had sales offices and manufacturing plants in 23 countries outside the United States and satellite sales offices in another 10 countries. 
 
 We have a Code of Business Conduct and detailed Core Policies that we apply across all of our operations around the world. These policies represent a set of common values that apply to all employees and all of our business dealings. We have adopted policies and processes, and conduct employee training, intended to ensure compliance with various economic sanctions and export controls, including the regulations of the U.S. Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC ). We do not conduct any business in the following countries that are subject to U.S. economic sanctions: Cuba; Iran; North Korea; Syria and the Crimea region of the Ukraine. 
 
 Competition 
 
 Many of our markets are highly competitive. However, we compete effectively due to the quality and breadth of our adhesives, sealants and specialty chemical portfolio and the experience and expertise of our commercial organizations. Within the adhesives and other specialty chemical markets, we believe few suppliers have comparable global reach and corresponding ability to deliver quality and consistency to multinational customers. Our competition is made up generally of two types of companies: (1) similar multinational suppliers and (2) regional or specialty suppliers that typically compete in only one region or within a narrow geographic area within a region. The multinational competitors typically maintain a broad product offering and range of technology, while regional or specialty companies tend to have limited or more focused product ranges and technology. 
 
 Principal competitive factors in the sale of adhesives and other specialty chemicals are product performance, supply assurance, technical service, quality, price and customer service.

Customers 
 
 We have cultivated strong, integrated relationships with a diverse set of customers worldwide. Our customers are among the technology and market leaders in consumer goods, construction and industrial markets. We pride ourselves on long-term, collaborative customer relationships and a diverse portfolio of customers in which no single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of consolidated net revenue. 
 
 Our leading customers include manufacturers of food and beverages, hygiene products, clothing, major appliances, electronics, automobiles, aerospace and defense products, solar energy systems, filters, construction materials, wood flooring, furniture, cabinetry, windows, doors, tissue and towel, corrugation, tube winding, packaging, and tapes and labels. 
 
 Our products are delivered directly to customers primarily from our manufacturing and distribution facilities, with additional deliveries made through distributors and retailers. 
 
 Human Capital Resources and Management 
 
 Employees and Labor Relations 
 
 As of December 3, 2022, we have approximately 7,000 employees in 45 countries, including approximately 2,500 employees based in the U.S. Approximately 450 U.S. employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements with various unions. Approximately 750 employees in foreign countries are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Overall, we consider our employee relations to be good. 
 
 Health and Safety 
 
 The health and safety of our employees and anyone who enters our workplace is important, and we believe that nothing we do is worth getting hurt for. We have a strong environmental, health and safety program that focuses on implementing policies and training programs, as well as performing self-audits to enhance workplace safety. 
 
 Competitive Pay and Benefits 
 
 Our primary compensation strategy is Pay for Performance , which supports a culture of accountability and performance. Our compensation guiding principles are to structure compensation that is simple, aligned and balanced. We believe that these principles are strongly aligned with the strategic priorities of our business and our objective to deliver value for our shareholders. 
 
 We are committed to fair pay and strive to be externally competitive while ensuring internal equity across our organization. We conduct global pay equity assessments and compensation reviews, and when necessary, we take action to address areas of concern. 
 
 Quality, affordable health care is the foundation of the comprehensive benefits package we offer our employees. It is one of the tools we use to recruit and retain, and it is seen as the preferred benefit by most employees. Employees in the United States earning below 52,000 each year have 100 of their individual medical premiums covered by the Company in the form of a medical premium reimbursement. 
 
 Results-Driven, Collaborative Culture 
 
 Our purpose is connecting what matters for all stakeholders and we go about this by winning the right way through our core values. We expect employees to act with integrity and hold each other accountable for our actions. We value our global team s diverse perspectives, backgrounds and experiences. We make daily, conscious choices to excel, by always bringing passion and creativity to our work, and by striving for innovation ethically and fairly. Our worldwide network of culture champions supports our focus on being At Our Best. Our communication on goals, targets and performance is frequent and transparent. We continue to leverage flexible work options available to employees who don't need our facilities to perform their jobs and this continues to enhance connections across the company, as well as with customers and external partners. This supports our desire to be first and fastest in finding solutions for customers and improving our overall effectiveness. Finally, we continue to take great pride in our focus on giving back to the communities in which we operate through the giving efforts of the H.B. Fuller Foundation and the thousands of employee volunteer hours each year.

I nclusion and Diversit y 
 
 As a global company, we currently have employees present in 45 countries around the world. We place strong value on collaboration and we believe that working together leads to better outcomes for our customers. This extends to the way we treat each other as team members. We strive to create an environment where innovative ideas can flourish by demonstrating respect for each other and valuing the diverse opinions, background and viewpoints of employees. We believe that diversity in our teams leads to new ideas, helps us solve problems and allows us to better connect with our global customer base. 
 
 We are taking specific actions to foster inclusion and diversity into our culture. Learning resources have been implemented to support greater awareness and understanding of the behaviors expected from employees. We have introduced employee networking groups, an expanded and enhanced mentoring program and focused development programs with the goal of creating meaningful opportunities for employees. We have adjusted our recruiting practices to ensure we are getting the right level of exposure to diverse candidates. 
 
 Talent Development 
 
 We recognize how important it is for our colleagues to develop and progress in their careers. We provide a variety of resources to help our colleagues grow in their current roles and build new skills, including online development resources focused on specific business imperatives with access to hundreds of online courses in our learning management system. We have implemented an innovative delivery method for leadership training to drive experiential learning and to increase access to leaders around the world. Individual development planning is a part of our annual goal setting process and people managers are expected to have regular discussions with employees to measure progress and make needed adjustments. We focus on getting employees into roles with greater responsibility and opportunities for advancement that are also aligned with their career path to facilitate development and maximize potential. Finally, we provide ambitious employees with short-term opportunities in unique assignments in addition to their current roles. These assignments support the employees development while also supporting company initiatives that are required to be resourced with talented employees. 
 
 Raw Materials 
 
 We use several principal raw materials in our manufacturing processes, including tackifying resins, polymers, synthetic rubbers, vinyl acetate monomer and plasticizers. We generally avoid sole source supplier arrangements for raw materials. 
 
 The majority of our raw materials are petroleum/natural gas based derivatives. Under normal conditions, raw materials are available on the open market. Prices and availability are subject to supply and demand market mechanisms. Raw material costs are primarily determined by the balance of supply against the aggregate demand from the adhesives industry and other industries that use the same raw material streams. The cost of crude oil and natural gas, the primary feedstocks for our raw materials, can also impact the cost of our raw materials. 
 
 See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on raw material cost and availability. 
 
 Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 
 
 Much of the technology we use in our products and manufacturing processes is available in the public domain. For technology not available in the public domain, we rely on trade secrets and patents when appropriate to protect our competitive position. We also license some patented technology from other sources. Our business is not materially dependent upon licenses or similar rights or on any single patent or group of related patents. 
 
 We enter into agreements with many employees to protect rights to technology and intellectual property. Confidentiality commitments also are routinely obtained from customers, suppliers and others to safeguard proprietary information. 
 
 We own numerous trademarks and service marks in various countries. Trademarks, such as H.B. Fuller , Swift , Advantra , Clarity , Earthic , Sesame , TEC , Foster , Rakoll , Rapidex , Full-Care , Thermonex , Silaprene , Eternabond , Cilbond , Hydroarmor , K dispace , Weld Mount and TONSAN are important in marketing products. Many of our trademarks and service marks are registered. U.S. trademark registrations are for a term of ten years and are renewable every ten years as long as the trademarks are used in the regular course of trade. 
 
 Research and Development 
 
 Our investment in research and development creates new and innovative adhesive technology platforms, enhances product performance, ensures a competitive cost structure and leverages available raw materials. New product development is a key research and development outcome, providing higher-value solutions to existing customers or meeting new customers needs. Projects are developed in local laboratories in each region, where we understand our customer base the best. Platform developments are coordinated globally through our network of laboratories. 
 
 Through designing and developing new polymers and new formulations, we expect to continue to grow in our current markets. We also develop new applications for existing products and technologies, and improve manufacturing processes to enhance productivity and product quality. Research and development efforts are closely aligned to customer needs. We foster open innovation, seek supplier-driven new technology and use relationships with academic and other institutions to enhance our capabilities.

As climate change and other sustainability concerns become more prevalent, governmental and non-governmental organizations, customers and investors are increasingly focusing on these issues. We continue to monitor our markets to ensure we are developing the adhesives and sealants to support our customers responses to changing consumer demand, new product designs and upcoming regulatory and sustainability efforts. We invest significantly in innovation, research and expertise, which are crucial for the continuous extraction of value from our business strategy. This also facilitates the creation of new high-performance solutions that enable customers to improve their products and processes to better achieve their sustainability programs. 
 
 Regulatory Compliance 
 
 We comply with applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and workers' safety, including those required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA and the EU s Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals REACH regulation. This includes regular review of and upgrades to environmental, health and safety policies, practices and procedures as well as improved production methods to minimize our facilities outgoing waste, based on evolving societal standards and increased environmental understanding. Expenditures to comply with environmental regulations over the next two years are estimated to be approximately 15.4 million, including approximately 2.8 million of capital expenditures. See additional disclosure under Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 Various legislation, regulations and international accords pertaining to climate change have been implemented or are being considered for implementation, particularly as they relate to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. These laws may directly impact the Company, however we have not determined the extent of potential disclosures or other reporting requirements. We continue to monitor the development and implementation of such legislation and regulations. We also continue to regularly report our sustainability efforts and metrics under the Global Reporting Initiative GRI framework and report our goals and progress in our annual Sustainability Report. 
 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA prohibits bribery of government officials to benefit business interests. We operate and sell our products in countries that are rated as high-risk for corruption, which creates the risk of unauthorized conduct by our employees, customs brokers, distributors or other third party intermediaries that could be in violation of the FCPA or similar local regulations. We comply with the FCPA s requirements to make and keep accurate books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. 
 
 We are also subject to and comply with increasingly complex privacy and data protection laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. This includes the European Union s General Data Protection Regulation GDPR ), which enforces rules relating to the protection of processing and movement of personal data. The interpretation and enforcement of such regulations are continuously evolving and there may be uncertainty with respect to how to comply with them. Noncompliance with GDPR and other data protection laws could result in damage to our reputation and payment of monetary penalties. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 Our operating segments have historically had lower net revenue in winter months, which is primarily our first fiscal quarter, mainly due to international holidays and the seasonal decline in construction and consumer spending activities.

 Available Information 
 
 For more information about us, visit our website at: www.hbfuller.com. 
 
 We file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC via EDGAR. Our SEC filings are available free of charge to the public on the SEC website at www.sec.gov and on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been filed with or furnished to the SEC. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 As a global manufacturer of adhesives, sealants and other specialty chemical products, we operate in a business environment that is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Below are the most significant factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Strategic and Operational Risks 
 
 Our business and operations have been, and may in the future, be adversely affected by epidemics, pandemics, outbreaks of disease and other adverse public health developments, including COVID-19. 
 
 Epidemics, pandemics, outbreaks of novel diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries and states where we operate may arise at any time. Such developments, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and in the future may have, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These effects include a potentially negative impact on the availability of our key personnel, labor shortages and increased turnover, temporary closures of our facilities or facilities of our business partners, customers, suppliers, third-party service providers or other vendors, and interruption of domestic and global supply chains, distribution channels and liquidity and capital or financial markets. In particular, restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, port closures or increased border controls or closures, or other impacts on domestic and global supply chains or distribution channels, could increase our costs for raw materials and commodity costs, increase demand for raw materials and commodities from competing purchasers, limit our ability to meet customer demand or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or cash flows. Precautionary measures that we may take in the future intended to limit the impact of any epidemic, pandemic, disease outbreak or other public health development, may result in additional costs. In addition, such epidemics, pandemics, disease outbreaks or other public health developments may adversely affect economies and financial markets throughout the world, such as the effect that COVID-19 has had on world economies and financial markets, which may affect our ability to obtain additional financing for our businesses and demand for our products and services. The extent to which COVID-19 or other pandemics will impact our business and our financial results in the future will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Such developments may include ongoing spread of the virus, disease severity, outbreak duration, extent of any reoccurrence of the coronavirus or any evolutions or mutations of the virus, and availability, administration and effectiveness of vaccines and development of therapeutic treatments that can restore consumer and business economic confidence. As a result, it is not possible to predict the overall future impact of COVID-19 on our business, liquidity, capital resources and financial results.

Table of Contents 

Increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials have adversely affected, and could continue to erode, our profit margins, and could negatively impact our operating results. 
 
 In 2022, raw material costs made up approximately 75 percent of our cost of sales. Based on 2022 financial results, a hypothetical one percent change in our raw material costs would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately 15.7 million or 0.28 per diluted share. Accordingly, changes in the cost of raw materials, due to scarcity, supplier disruptions, inflation and for other reasons, can significantly impact our earnings. Raw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from a number of suppliers and many of the raw materials are petroleum and natural gas based derivatives. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are generally available on the open market from a variety of producers. While alternate supplies of most key raw materials are available, supplier production outages may lead to strained supply-demand situations for certain raw materials. The substitution of key raw materials requires us to identify new supply sources, reformulate and re-test and may require seeking re-approval from our customers using those products. From time to time, the prices and availability of these raw materials may fluctuate, which could impair our ability to procure necessary materials, or increase the cost of manufacturing products. If the prices of raw materials increase in a short period of time, we may be unable to pass these increases on to our customers in a timely manner and could experience reductions to our profit margins. 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on raw material prices, which could continue in the future. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic and responses to it have significantly limited or prevented the movement of goods and services worldwide, which has resulted in and could continue to result in disruptions in our supply chain and our difficulty in procuring or inability to procure raw materials necessary for the manufacturing of our products. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and responses to it has increased and could continue to increase the costs of making and distributing our products or result in delays in delivering, or an inability to deliver, them to our customers. 
 
 We experience substantial competition in each of the operating segments and geographic areas in which we operate. 
 
 Our wide variety of products are sold in numerous markets, each of which is highly competitive. Our competitive position in markets is, in part, subject to external factors. For example, supply and demand for certain of our products is driven by end-use markets and worldwide capacities which, in turn, impact demand for and pricing of our products. Many of our direct competitors are part of large multinational companies and may have more resources than we do. Any increase in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices, which could result in reduced profit margins. This may impair the ability to grow or even to maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. While we have an extensive customer base, loss of certain top customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced, and no assurances can be made that we would be able to regain or replace any lost customers. 
 
 Failure to develop new products and protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our future performance and growth. 
 
 Ongoing innovation and product development are important factors in our competitiveness. Failure to create new products and generate new ideas could negatively impact our ability to grow and deliver strong financial results. We continually apply for and obtain U.S. and foreign patents to protect the results of our research for use in our operations and licensing. We are party to a number of patent licenses and other technology agreements. We rely on patents, confidentiality agreements and internal security measures to protect our intellectual property. Failure to protect this intellectual property could negatively affect our future performance and growth. 
 
 Our operations may present health and safety risks. 
 
 Notwithstanding our emphasis on the safety of our employees and contractors and the precautions we take related to health and safety, we may be unable to avoid safety incidents relating to our operations that result in injuries or deaths. Certain safety incidents may result in legal or regulatory action that could result in increased expenses or reputational damage. We maintain workers' compensation insurance to address the risk of incurring material liabilities for injuries or deaths, but there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could result in material liabilities to us for any injuries or deaths. Changes to federal, state and local employee health and safety regulations, and legislative, regulatory or societal responses to safety incidents may result in heightened regulations or public scrutiny that may increase our compliance costs or result in reputational damage. 
 
 A failure in our information technology systems could negatively impact our business. 
 
 We rely on information technology to record and process transactions, manage our business and maintain the financial accuracy of our records. Our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from various sources, including power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, vandalism, catastrophic events and human error. Interruptions of our computer systems could disrupt our business, for example by leading to plant downtime and/or power outages, and could result in the loss of business and cause us to incur additional expense. 
 
 We are in the process of implementing a global Enterprise Resource Planning ERP system that we refer to as Project ONE, which will upgrade and standardize our information system. Implementation of Project ONE began in our North America adhesives business in 2014 and, through 2022, we completed implementation of this system in various parts of our business including Latin America (except Brazil), Australia and various other businesses in North America and EIMEA. During 2023 and beyond, we will continue implementation in North America, EIMEA and Asia Pacific. 
 
 Any delays or other failure to achieve our implementation goals may adversely impact our financial results. In addition, the failure to either deliver the application on time or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs could lead to business disruption and loss of business. Failure or abandonment of any part of the ERP system could result in a write-off of part or all of the costs that have been capitalized on the project. 
 
 We are at risk of cyber-attacks or other security breaches that could compromise sensitive business information, undermine our ability to operate effectively and expose us to liability, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer. 
 
 Increasingly, companies are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks on an ongoing basis. In addition to traditional computer hackers , malicious code (such as viruses and worms), phishing attempts, employee theft or misuse, and denial of service attacks, sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors engage in intrusions and attacks (including advanced persistent threat intrusions) and add to the risks to internal networks, cloud deployed enterprise and customer-facing environments and the information they store and process. Despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such threats, it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate these risks. We, and our third-party software and service providers, may face security threats and attacks from a variety of sources.

Table of Contents 

As part of our business, we store our data, including intellectual property, and certain data about our employees, customers and vendors in our information technology systems. Our security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or other information to gain access to our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. In addition, given their size and complexity, our information systems could be vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party vendors and/or business partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties attempting to gain unauthorized access to our products, systems or confidential information. 
 
 If a third party gained unauthorized access to our data, including any data regarding our employees, customers or vendors, the security breach could expose us to risks. Such unauthorized access and a failure to effectively recover from breaches could compromise confidential information, disrupt our business, harm our reputation, result in the loss of customer confidence, business and assets (including trade secrets and other intellectual property), result in regulatory proceedings and legal claims, and have a negative impact on our financial results. 
 
 Risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on us and the inability to execute organizational restructuring may affect our results. 
 
 As part of our growth strategy, from time to time, we have made acquisitions of complementary businesses or products. The ability to grow through acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions. If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing business, our results of operations and our cash flows could be adversely affected. Our acquisition strategy also involves other risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return on capital, unidentified issues not discovered in our investigations and evaluations of those strategies and acquisitions, and difficulties implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, procedures, policies and systems. Future acquisitions could result in additional debt and other liabilities, and increased interest expense, restructuring charges and amortization expense related to intangible assets. 
 
 Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the United States, where there is the potential for significant economic and political disruptions. Our operations in these markets may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in the United States, including political and economic instability, project delay or abandonment due to unanticipated government actions, inadequate investment in infrastructure, undeveloped property rights and legal systems, unfamiliar regulatory environments, relationships with local partners, language and cultural differences and increased difficulty recruiting, training and retaining qualified employees. 
 
 In addition, our profitability is dependent on our ability to drive sustainable productivity improvements such as cost savings through organizational restructuring. Delays or unexpected costs may prevent us from realizing the full operational and financial benefits of such restructuring initiatives and may potentially disrupt our operations. 
 
 Legal and Regulatory Risks 
 
 The impact of changing laws or regulations or the manner of interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. 
 
 New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. In addition, compliance with laws and regulations is complicated by our substantial global footprint, which will require significant and additional resources to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the various countries where we conduct business. 
 
 Our global operations expose us to trade and economic sanctions and other restrictions imposed by the U.S., the EU and other governments and organizations. The U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce, State, Homeland Security, and Treasury and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of economic sanctions laws, export control laws, the FCPA and other federal statutes and regulations, including those established by the OFAC. Under these laws and regulations, as well as other anti-corruption laws, anti-money-laundering laws, export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations, various government agencies may require export licenses, may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned persons or entities and modifications to compliance programs, including import restrictions, which may increase compliance costs, and may subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions. A violation of these laws, regulations, policies or procedures could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Although we have implemented policies and procedures in these areas, we cannot assure that our policies and procedures are sufficient or that directors, officers, employees, representatives, manufacturers, suppliers and agents have not engaged and will not engage in conduct in violation of such policies and procedures. 
 
 Costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental laws and regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results. 
 
 We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that impose various environmental controls on us or otherwise relate to environmental protection, the sale and export of certain chemicals or hazardous materials, and various health and safety matters. The costs of complying with these laws and regulations can be significant and may increase as applicable requirements and their enforcement become more stringent and new rules are implemented. Adverse developments and/or periodic settlements could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of current environmental matters.

Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations. 
 
 Climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our future operations from natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires or flooding. Such extreme weather conditions could pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt operation of our supply chain and may increase operational costs. The impacts of climate change on global water resources may result in water scarcity, which could in the future impact our ability to access sufficient quantities of water in certain locations and result in increased costs. Concern over climate change could result in new legal or regulatory requirements designed to mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory requirements, we may experience increased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations and may adversely affect raw material sourcing, manufacturing operations and the distribution of our products. 
 
 We have lawsuits and claims against us with uncertain outcomes. 
 
 Our operations from time to time are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The results of any future litigation or settlement of such lawsuits and claims are inherently unpredictable, but such outcomes could be adverse and material in amount. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of current litigation. 
 
 The Company s effective tax rate could be volatile and materially change as a result of the adoption of new tax legislation and other factors. 
 
 A change in tax laws is one of many factors that impact the Company s effective tax rate. The U.S. Congress and other government agencies in jurisdictions where the Company does business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. As a result, the tax laws in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company does business could change, and any such changes could adversely impact our effective tax rate, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD"), an international association of 38 countries including the United States, has proposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. These proposals, if finalized and adopted by the associated countries, will likely increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. 
 
 The current U.S. presidential administration could enact changes in tax laws that could negatively impact the Company s effective tax rate. Prior to the U.S. presidential election, President Biden proposed an increase in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 21 to 28 , doubling the rate of tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the creation of a 10 penalty on certain imports and a 15 minimum tax on worldwide book income. Additionally, the proposed changes include significant provisions related to the deductibility of interest. If any or all of these (or similar) proposals are ultimately enacted into law, in whole or in part, they could have a negative impact to the Company s effective tax rate. 
 
 Additi onal income tax expense or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a negative impact on our financial results. 
 
 We are subject to income tax laws and regulations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. Our income tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and income tax liabilities could be adversely affected by the jurisdictional mix of earnings, changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations. In the ordinary course of our business, we are also subject to continuous examinations of our income tax returns by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final results of any tax examination or related litigation could be materially different from our related historical income tax provisions and accruals. Adverse developments in an audit, examination or litigation related to previously filed tax returns, or in the relevant jurisdiction s tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles and interpretations could have a material effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. 
 
 Financial Risks 
 
 We may be required to record impairment charges on our goodwill or long-lived assets. 
 
 Weak demand may cause underutilization of our manufacturing capacity or elimination of product lines; contract terminations or customer shutdowns may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment; or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific product or customer events may require us to record an impairment on tangible assets, such as facilities and equipment, as well as intangible assets, such as intellectual property or goodwill, which would have a negative impact on our financial results. 
 
 Our current indebtedness could have a negative impact on our liquidity or restrict our activities. 
 
 Our current indebtedness contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. Our overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could: 

limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions; 

make it more difficult to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our indebtedness; 

limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all; 

limit our flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which we operate and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future acquisitions, working capital, business activities and other general corporate requirements; 

limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and 

subject us to higher levels of indebtedness than our competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition. 

10

Table of Contents 

In addition, the restrictive covenants require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to economic conditions and to financial, market and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the instruments governing our indebtedness. 
 
 The interest rates of our term loans are priced using a spread over LIBOR. 
 
 LIBOR, the London Interbank Offered Rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. We typically use LIBOR as a reference rate or index in our term loans such that the interest due to our creditors pursuant to a term loan extended to us is calculated using LIBOR. Most of our term loan agreements contain a stated minimum value for LIBOR. 
 
 On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the entity that calculates LIBOR, announced that LIBOR was to be phased out by the end of 2021. Subsequently, on March 5, 2021, LIBOR s administrator announced that publication of overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month U.S. dollar LIBOR would cease immediately following publication of such interest rates on June 30, 2023, and that publication of all other currency and tenor variants would cease immediately following publication on December 31, 2021. In December 2022, the FASB released an exposure draft that proposes deferring the sunset date of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standard Codification ASC Topic 848, Reference Rate Reform , which provides optional relief for contract modifications that are related to reference rate reform, from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. 
 
 The U.S. Federal Reserve has selected the Secured Overnight Funding Rate ("SOFR") as the preferred alternate rate to LIBOR. We are planning for this transition and will amend any agreements to accommodate the SOFR rate where required. While our term loan is calculated using LIBOR as its underlying rate, our revolver has transitioned to now using SOFR as its underlying rate. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of the transition to the SOFR rate, which remains subject to uncertainty. 
 
 Macroeconomic Risks 
 
 Uncertainties in foreign economic, political, regulatory and social conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency may adversely affect our results. 
 
 Approximately 55 percent, or 2.1 billion, of our net revenue was generated outside the United States in 2022. International operations could be adversely affected by changes in economic, political, regulatory, and social conditions, especially in Brazil, Russia, China, the Middle East, including Turkey and Egypt, and other developing or emerging markets where we do business. An economic downturn in the businesses or geographic areas in which we sell our products could reduce demand for these products and result in a decrease in sales volume that could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Product demand often depends on end-use markets. Economic conditions that reduce consumer confidence or discretionary spending may reduce product demand. Challenging economic conditions may also impair the ability of our customers to pay for products they have purchased, and as a result, our reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. In addition, trade protection measures, anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, differing intellectual property rights and changes in legal and regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could potentially result in increases or decreases in net revenue, cost of raw materials and earnings and may adversely affect the value of our assets outside the United States. In 2022, the change in foreign currencies negatively impacted our net revenue by approximately 191.7 million. In 2022, we spent approximately 2.2 billion for raw materials worldwide of which approximately 1.2 billion was purchased outside the United States. Based on 2022 financial results, a hypothetical one percent change in our cost of sales due to foreign currency rate changes would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately 10.5 million or 0.19 per diluted share. Although we utilize risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate market fluctuations in foreign currencies, any changes in strategy in regard to risk management tools can also affect revenue, expenses and results of operations and there can be no assurance that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated. 
 
 Distressed financial markets may result in dramatic deflation of financial asset valuations and a general disruption in capital markets. 
 
 Adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets could have a negative impact on the value of our pension trust assets, our future estimated pension liabilities and other postretirement benefit plans. In addition, we could be required to provide increased pension plan funding. As a result, our financial results could be negatively impacted. Reduced access to capital markets may affect our ability to invest in strategic growth initiatives such as acquisitions. In addition, the reduced credit availability could limit our customers ability to invest in their businesses, refinance maturing debt obligations, or meet their ongoing working capital needs. If these customers do not have sufficient access to the financial markets, demand for our products may decline. 
 
 The military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the global response to it, could adversely impact our revenues, gross margins and financial results. 
 
 The U.S. government and other nations have imposed significant restrictions on most companies ability to do business in Russia as a result of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Increases in energy demand and supply disruptions caused by the Russia and Ukraine conflict have resulted in significantly higher energy prices, particularly in Europe. It is not possible to predict the broader or longer-term consequences of this conflict, which could include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, energy shortages, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, security conditions, currency exchange rates and financial markets. Such geo-political instability and uncertainty could have a negative impact on our ability to sell to, ship products to, collect payments from, and support customers in certain regions based on trade restrictions, embargoes and export control law restrictions, and logistics restrictions including closures of air space, and could increase the costs, risks and adverse impacts from these new challenges. We may also be the subject of increased cyber-attacks. While Russia does not constitute a material portion of our business, a significant escalation or expansion of economic disruption or the conflict's current scope could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 
 Catastrophic events could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers, having a negative impact on our financial results. 
 
 Unexpected events, including global pandemics, natural disasters and severe weather events, fires or explosions at our facilities or those of our suppliers, acts of war or terrorism, supply disruptions or breaches of security of our information technology systems could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm our operations, our customers and our suppliers. Such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers and deliver products to our customers.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 
 Environmental Matters 
 
 From time to time, we become aware of compliance matters relating to, or receive notices from, federal, state or local entities regarding possible or alleged violations of environmental, health or safety laws and regulations. Also, from time to time, we are identified as a potentially responsible party PRP under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA and/or similar state laws that impose liability for costs relating to the clean up of contamination resulting from past spills, disposal or other release of hazardous substances. We are also subject to similar laws in some of the countries where current and former facilities are located. Our environmental, health and safety department monitors compliance with applicable laws on a global basis. 
 
 Currently, we are involved in various environmental investigations, clean up activities and administrative proceedings and lawsuits. In particular, we are currently deemed a PRP in conjunction with numerous other parties, in a number of government enforcement actions associated with landfills and/or hazardous waste sites. As a PRP, we may be required to pay a share of the costs of investigation and clean up of these sites. 
 
 We are also engaged in environmental remediation and monitoring efforts at a number of current and former operating facilities. To the extent we can reasonably estimate the amount of our probable liabilities for environmental matters, we establish a financial provision. It is reasonably possible that we may have additional liabilities related to these known environmental matters. However, the full extent of our future liability for environmental matters is difficult to predict because of uncertainty as to the cost of investigation and clean up of the sites, our responsibility for such hazardous substances and the number of and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties. 
 
 While uncertainties exist with respect to the amounts and timing of the ultimate environmental liabilities, based on currently available information, we have concluded that these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow. However, adverse developments and/or periodic settlements could negatively impact the results of operations or cash flows in one or more future periods. 
 
 Other Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time and in the ordinary course of business, we are a party to, or a target of, lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, contract, patent and intellectual property, environmental, health and safety, tax and employment matters. While we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters, we have concluded, based upon currently available information, that the ultimate resolution of any pending matter, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow. However, adverse developments and/or periodic settlements could negatively impact the results of operations or cash flows in one or more future periods.

1 The total number of shares purchased are shares withheld to satisfy the employees' withholding taxes upon vesting of restricted stock. Repurchases of common stock are made to support our stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. Upon vesting of restricted stock awarded to employees, shares are withheld to cover the employees' minimum withholding taxes. 
 
 On April 7, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to 300.0 million of our outstanding common shares for a period of up to five years. Under the program, we are authorized to repurchase shares for cash on the open market, from time to time, in privately negotiated transactions or block transactions, or through an accelerated repurchase agreement. The timing of such repurchases is dependent on price, market conditions and applicable regulatory requirements. Upon repurchase of the shares, we reduce our common stock for the par value of the shares with the excess being applied against additional paid in capital. This authorization replaces the April 6, 2017 authorization to repurchase shares.

 Overview 
 
 H.B. Fuller Company is a global formulator, manufacturer and marketer of adhesives and other specialty chemica l products. We have three reportable segments: Hygiene, Health and Consumable Adhesives, Engineering Adhesives and Construction Adhesives. 
 
 The Hygiene, Health and Consumable Adhesives operating segment manufactures and supplies adhesives products in the assembly, packaging, converting, nonwoven and hygiene, health and beauty, flexible packaging, graphic arts and envelope markets. The Engineering Adhesives operating segment provides high-performance adhesives to the transportation, electronics, medical, clean energy, aerospace and defense, performance wood, insulating glass, textile, appliance and heavy machinery markets. The Construction Adhesives operating segment manufactures and provides specialty adhesives, sealants, tapes, mortars, grouts, and application devices for commercial building roofing systems, heavy infrastructure projects, road/highway/airport transportation applications, telecom/5G utilities, industrial LNG plants, building envelope applications, HVAC insulation systems, and for both residential and commercial flooring underlayment solutions. 
 
 Total Company 
 
 When reviewing our financial statements, it is important to understand how certain external factors impact us. These factors include: 

Changes in the prices of our raw materials that are primarily derived from refining crude oil and natural gas, 

Global supply of and demand for raw materials, 

Economic growth rates, and 

Currency exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar. 

While we encountered inflationary pressures in fiscal year 2022, which factored into higher raw material and operating costs, these inflationary pressures were offset by higher net revenue. We expect inflationary pressures to continue into fiscal year 2023. 
 
 We purchase thousands of raw materials, the majority of which are petroleum/natural gas derivatives. The price of these derivatives impacts the cost of our raw materials. However, the supply of and demand for key raw materials has a greater impact on our costs. As demand increases in high-growth areas, the supply of key raw materials may tighten, resulting in certain materials being put on allocation. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, also can have an impact as key raw material producers are shut down for extended periods of time. We continually monitor capacity utilization figures, market supply and demand conditions, feedstock costs and inventory levels, as well as derivative and intermediate prices, which affect our raw materials. With approximately 75 percent of our cost of sales accounted for by raw materials, our financial results are extremely sensitive to changing costs in this area.

The pace of economic growth directly impacts certain industries to which we supply products. For example, adhesives-related revenues from durable goods customers in areas such as appliances, furniture and other woodworking applications tend to fluctuate with the overall economic activity. In business components such as Construction Adhesives and insulating glass in Engineering Adhesives, revenues tend to move with more specific economic indicators such as housing starts and other construction-related activity. 
 
 The movement of foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the U.S. dollar impacts the translation of the foreign entities financial statements into U.S. dollars. As foreign currencies weaken against the U.S. dollar, our revenues and costs decrease as the foreign currency-denominated financial statements translate into fewer U.S. dollars. The fluctuations of the Euro, the Tur kish lira and the Chinese renminbi against the U.S. dollar have the largest impact on our financial results as compared to all other currencies. In 2022, currency fluctuations had a negative impact on net revenue of approximately 191.7 million as compared to 2021. 
 
 K ey financial results and transactions for 2022 included the following: 

Net revenue increased 14.4 percent from 2021 primarily driven by a 15.4 percent increase in product pricing, a 1.6 percent increase due to acquisitions and a 1.2 percent increase in sales volume, partially offset by a 5.8 percent decrease due to currency fluctuations. Additionally, every five or six years, we have a 53rd week in our fiscal year. 2022 was a 53-week year which increased our revenue by approximately 2.0 percent. 

Gross profit margin was relatively consistent year over year. Gross profit margins were 25.7 percent in 2022 and 25.8 percent in 2021. 

Cash flow generated by operating activities was 256.5 million in 2022 as compared to 213.3 million in 2021. 

Our total year organic sales growth, which we define as the combined variances from sales volume and product pricing, increased 16.6 percent for 2022 compared to 2021. 
 
 In 2022 , our diluted earnings per share was 3.26 compared to 2.97 in 2021 . The higher earnings per share in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to higher net revenue, partially offset by higher raw material, operating costs, interest expense, other income, net, and higher income tax expense. 
 
 Information pertaining to fiscal year 2020 was included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 27, 2021, under Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations, which was filed with the SEC on January 25, 2022. 
 
 Changes in Accounting Principle s 
 
 In the first quarter of 2021, we adopted new accounting standards related to the measurement of credit losses on financial statements requiring financial assets measured at amortized cost basis be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. Prior periods were not restated for this adoption. See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 
 Project ONE 
 
 In December 2012, our Board of Directors approved a multi-year project to replace and enhance our existing core information technology platforms. The scope for this project includes most of the basic transaction processing for the company including customer orders, procurement, manufacturing and financial reporting. The project envisions harmonized business processes for all of our operating segments supported with one standard software configuration. The execution of this project, which we refer to as Project ONE, is being supported by internal resources and consulting services. Implementation of Project ONE began in our North America adhesives business in 2014 and, through 2022, we completed implementation of this system in various parts of our business including Latin America (except Brazil), Australia, and various other businesses in North America and EIMEA. During 2023 and beyond, we will continue implementation in North America, EIMEA and Asia Pacific. 
 
 Total expenditures for Project ONE are estimated to be 200 to 210 million, of which 55-60 is expected to be capital expenditures. Our total project-to-date expenditures are approximatel y 163 million, of which approximately 94 million are capital expenditures. Given the complexity of the implementation, the total investment to complete the project may exceed our estimate. 
 
 Restructuring Plan 
 
 During the fourth quarter of 2019, we approved a restructuring plan related to organizational changes and other actions to optimize operations in connection with the realignment of the Company into three global business units 2020 Restructuring Plan ). We have incurred costs of 20.3 million under this plan as of December 3, 2022, which is substantially complete.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates 
 
 Management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition are based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe the critical accounting policies and areas that require the most significant judgments and estimates to be used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements relate to goodwill impairment; pension and other postretirement assumptions; long-lived assets recoverability; valuation of product, environmental and other litigation liabilities; valuation of deferred tax assets and accuracy of tax contingencies; and valuation of acquired assets and liabilities. 
 
 Goodwill 
 
 Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a purchase business combination. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units, which are our operating segments or one level below our operating segments (the component level). Reporting units are determined by the discrete financial information available for the component and whether it is regularly reviewed by segment management. Components are aggregated into a single reporting unit if they share similar economic characteristics. Our reporting units are as follows: Hygiene, Health and Consumable Adhesives, Engineering Adhesives and Construction Adhesives. 
 
 We evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter or earlier upon the occurrence of substantive unfavorable changes in economic conditions, industry trends, costs, cash flows, or ongoing declines in market capitalization. The quantitative impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting units, and the determination of fair value of each reporting unit. The impairment test requires the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. In performing the impairment test, we determined the fair value of our reporting units through the income approach by using discounted cash flow DCF analyses. Determining fair value requires the Company to make judgments about appropriate forecasted revenue and related revenue growth rate, the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") margins rate and the weighted average cost of capital. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis for each reporting unit are based on the reporting unit's budget, long-term business plan and recent operating performance. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and market conditions. Given the inherent uncertainty in determining the assumptions underlying a DCF analysis, actual results may differ from those used in our valuations. In assessing the reasonableness of the determined fair values, we also reconciled the aggregate determined fair value of the Company to the Company's market capitalization, which, at the date of our 2022 impairment test, included a 6 percent control premium. 
 
 For the 2022 impairment test, the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the respective carrying values by 10 percent to 84 percent ("headroom"). Significant assumptions used in the DCF analysis included discount rates that ranged from 9.4 percent to 10.9 percent and long-term revenue growth rates. The Construction Adhesives reporting unit, with 425.8 million of goodwill assigned to it as of December 3, 2022, had headroom of 10 percent. An increase in the discount rate of 70 basis points or a decrease in the long-term growth rates of 25 percent would result in the fair value of the Construction Adhesives reporting unit falling below its carrying value. The Engineering Adhesives and Hygiene, Health and Consumable Adhesives reporting units had significant fair value in excess of carrying value. 
 
 Management will continue to monitor these reporting units for changes in the business environment that could impact recoverability. The recoverability of goodwill is dependent upon the continued growth of cash flows from our business activities. If the economy or business environment falter and we are unable to achieve our assumed revenue growth rates or profit margin percentages, our projections used would need to be remeasured, which could impact the carrying value of our goodwill in one or more of our reporting units. Most significantly, for our Construction Adhesives reporting unit, a decrease in the planned volume revenue growth would negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit and the calculation of excess carrying value. 
 
 See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding goodwill.

Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Assumptions 
 
 We sponsor defined-benefit pension plans in both the U.S. and non-U.S. entities. Also in the U.S., we sponsor other postretirement plans for health care and life insurance benefits. Expenses and liabilities for the pension plans and other postretirement plans are actuarially calculated. These calculations are based on our assumptions related to the discount rate, expected return on assets, projected salary increases and health care cost trend rates. Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes disclosure of assumptions employed in these measurements for both the non-U.S. and U.S. plans. 
 
 The discount rate assumption is determined using an actuarial yield curve approach, which results in a discount rate that reflects the characteristics of the plan. The approach identifies a broad population of corporate bonds that meet the quality and size criteria for the particular plan. We use this approach rather than a specific index that has a certain set of bonds that may or may not be representative of the characteristics of our particular plan. A higher discount rate reduces the present value of the pension obligations. The discount rate for the U.S. pension plan was 5.36 percent at December 3, 2022, 2.76 percent at November 27, 2021 and 2.53 percent at November 28, 2020. Net periodic pension cost for a given fiscal year is based on assumptions developed at the end of the previous fiscal year. A discount rate change of 0.5 percentage points at December 3, 2022 would impact U.S. pension and other postretirement plan (income) expense by less than 0.1 million (pre-tax) in fiscal 2023. Discount rates for non-U.S. plans are determined in a manner consistent with the U.S. plans. 
 
 The expected long-term rat e of return on plan assets assumption for the U.S. pension plan was 7.00 percent in 2022 , 7.25 percent in 2021 and 7.50 percent in 2020 . Our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets was based on our target asset allocation assumption of 55 percent equities and 45 percent fixed-income. Management, in conjunction with our external financial advisors, determines the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by considering the expected future returns and volatility levels for each asset class that are based on historical returns and forward looking observations. For 2022 , the expected long-term rate of return on the target equities allocation was 8.50 percent and the expected long-term rate of return on the target fixed-income allocation was 5.60 percent. The total plan rate of return assumption included an estimate of the effect of diversification and the plan expense. A change of 0.5 percentage points for the expected return on assets assumption would impact U.S. net pension and other postretirement plan expense by approximately 2.2 million (pre-tax). 
 
 Management, in conjunction with our external financial advisors, uses the actual historical rates of return of the asset categories to assess the reasonableness of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The most recent 10-year and 20-year historical equity returns are shown in the table below. Our expected rate of return on our total portfolio is consistent with the historical patterns observed over longer time frames.

Beginning in 2022, our target allocation migrated from 60 percent equities and 40 percent fixed-income to 55 percent equities and 45 percent fixed income. The historical actual rate of return for the fixed income of 5.9 percent is since inception (16 years, 11 months). 
 
 The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption for non-U.S. pension plans was a weighted-average of 3.49 percent in 2022 compared to 6.15 percent in 2021 and 6.23 percent in 2020. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption used in each non-U.S. plan is determined on a plan-by-plan basis for each local jurisdiction and is based on expected future returns for the investment mix of assets currently in the portfolio for that plan. Management, in conjunction with our external financial advisors, develops expected rates of return for each plan, considers expected long-term returns for each asset category in the plan, reviews expectations for inflation for each local jurisdiction, and estimates the effect of active management of the plan s assets. Our largest non-U.S. pension plans are in the United Kingdom and Germany. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for the United Kingdom was 2.50 percent and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for Germany was 4.50 percent. Management, in conjunction with our external financial advisors, uses actual historical returns of the asset portfolio to assess the reasonableness of the expected rate of return for each plan. 
 
 The projected salary increase assumption is based on historic trends and comparisons to the external market. Higher rates of increase result in higher pension expenses. As this rate is also a long-term expected rate, it is less likely to change on an annual basis . Under the U.S. pension plan, the compensation amount was locked-in as of May 31, 2011 and thus the benefit no longer includes compensation increases. The 4.50 percent rate for 2020 is for the supplemental executive retirement plan only; for 2022 and 2021, there is no compensation increase as subsequent to November 27, 2021, there were no active employees in the supplemental executive retirement plan. Projected salary increase assumptions for non-U.S. plans are determined in a manner consistent with the U.S. plans.

Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets 
 
 The assessment of the recoverability of long-lived assets reflects our assumptions and estimates. Factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume, prices, inflation, currency exchange rates, tax rates and capital spending. Significant judgment is involved in estimating these factors, and they include inherent uncertainties. The measurement of the recoverability of these assets is dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions used in making these estimates and how the estimates compare to the eventual future operating performance of the specific businesses to which the assets are attributed. 
 
 Judgments made by us include the expected useful lives of long-lived assets. The ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets is affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. 
 
 Product, Environmental and Other Litigation Liabilities 
 
 As disclosed in Item 3. Legal Proceedings and in Note 1 and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are subject to various claims, lawsuits and other legal proceedings. Reserves for loss contingencies associated with these matters are established when it is determined that a liability is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The assessment of the probable liabilities is based on the facts and circumstances known at the time that the financial statements are being prepared. For cases in which it is determined that a liability is probable but only a range for the potential loss exists, the minimum amount of the range is recorded and subsequently adjusted as better information becomes available. 
 
 For cases in which insurance coverage is available, the gross amount of the estimated liabilities is accrued, and a receivable is recorded for any probable estimated insurance recoveries. A discussion of environmental, product and other litigation liabilities is disclosed in Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Based upon currently available facts, we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any pending legal proceeding, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our long-term financial condition. However, adverse developments and/or periodic settlements could negatively affect our results of operations or cash flows in one or more future quarters. 
 
 Income Tax Accounting 
 
 As part of the process of preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. The process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized. We have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. Increases in the valuation allowance result in additional expense to be reflected within the tax provision in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 3, 2022, the valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets totaled 14.4 million. 
 
 We recognize tax benefits for tax positions for which it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained by the applicable tax authority at the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We do not recognize a financial statement benefit for a tax position that does not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold. We believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. It is difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of any particular tax position. Future changes in judgment related to the resolution of tax positions will impact earnings in the quarter of such change. We adjust our income tax liabilities related to tax positions in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement with respect to a tax position would usually require cash. Based upon our analysis of tax positions taken on prior year returns and expected tax positions to be taken for the current year tax returns, we have identified gross uncertain tax positions of 17.6 million as of December 3, 2022 and 13.3 million as of November 27, 2021. 
 
 We have not recorded U.S. deferred income taxes for certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries undistributed earnings as such amounts are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. Should we change our business strategies related to these non-U.S. subsidiaries, additional U.S. tax liabilities could be incurred. It is not practical to estimate the amount of these additional tax liabilities. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on income tax accounting. 
 
 Acquisition Accounting 
 
 As we enter into business combinations, we perform acquisition accounting requirements including the following: 

Identifying the acquirer, 

Determining the acquisition date, 

Recognizing and measuring the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, and 

Recognizing and measuring goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase. 

18

Table of Contents 

We complete valuation procedures and record the resulting fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based upon the valuation of the business enterprise and the tangible and intangible assets acquired. Enterprise value allocation methodology requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If estimates or assumptions used to complete the enterprise valuation and estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities significantly differed from assumptions made, the resulting difference could materially affect the fair value of net assets. 
 
 The calculation of the fair value of the tangible assets, including property, plant and equipment, utilizes the cost approach, which computes the cost to replace the asset, less accrued depreciation resulting from physical deterioration, functional obsolescence and external obsolescence. The calculation of the fair value of the identified intangible assets are determined using cash flow models following the income approach or a discounted market-based methodology approach. Significant inputs include estimated revenue growth rates, gross margins, operating expenses, and estimated attrition, royalty and discount rates. Goodwill is recorded as the difference in the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities and the purchase price.

Organic revenue growth was 16.6 percent in 2022 compared to 2021 driven by a 20.0 percent increase in Hygiene, Health and Consumable Adhesives, a 15.9 percent increase in Engineering Adhesives and a 7.0 percent increase in Construction Adhesives. The increase was driven by a 15.4 percent increase in product pricing and a 1.2 percent increase in sales volume. The 1.6 percent from M A is due to the acquisitions of Fourny and Apollo. The negative 5.8 percent currency impact was primarily driven by a weaker Euro, Turkish lira, Chinese renminbi, British pound and Argentinian peso compared to the U.S. dollar. Additionally, net revenue in 2022 was higher than 2021 by 2.0 percent from an additional week of revenue in 2022 as it was a 53 week fiscal year compared to a 52 week fiscal year in 2021.

Income tax expense of 63.0 million in 2021 includes 4.3 million of discrete tax expense, primarily related to the revaluation of cross-currency swap agreements due to depreciation of the Euro versus U.S. dollar, changes in valuation allowances and several foreign discrete items. Excluding the discrete tax expense of 4.3 million, the overall effective tax rate was 27.1 percent. 
 
 The decrease in the overall effective tax rate for 2022 compared to 2021 , excluding the impact of discrete items, is primarily due to the change in the foreign rate differential resulting from a change in mix of earnings across jurisdictions.

Net income attributable to H.B. Fuller was 180.3 million in 2022 compared to 161.4 million in 2021. Diluted earnings per share were 3.26 per share in 2022 and 2.97 per share in 2021. 

Operating Segment Results 
 
 We are required to report segment information in the same way that we internally organize our business for assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation of resources. For segment evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, segment operating income is defined as gross profit less SG A expenses. Inter-segment revenues are recorded at cost plus a markup for administrative costs. Corporate expenses, other than those included in Corporate Unallocated, are allocated to each operating segment. 
 
 We have three reportable segments: Hygiene, Health and Consumable Adhesives, Engineering Adhesives and Construction Adhesives. The tables below provide certain information regarding the net revenue and segment operating income of each of our operating segments. Corporate Unallocated includes business acquisition and integration-related charges, organizational restructuring-related charges, the results of business divestitures and costs related to the implementation of Project ONE.

Net revenue increased 15.2 percent in 2022 compared to 2021. The 20.0 percent increase in organic growth was attributable to favorable product pricing. The negative currency effect was due to the weaker Euro, Turkish lira, Argentinian peso and Egyptian pound compared to the U.S. dollar. Additionally, net revenue in 2022 was higher than 2021 by 2.1 percent from an additional week of revenue in 2022 as it was a 53 week fiscal year compared to a 52 week fiscal year in 2021. As a percentage of net revenue, raw material costs increased 300 basis points due to higher raw material costs partially offset by higher net revenue. Other manufacturing costs as a percentage of net revenue decreased 250 basis points due to higher net revenue. SG A expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased 90 basis points in 2022 as compared to 2021 due to higher net revenue. Segment operating income increased 19.8 percent and segment operating margin as a percentage of net revenue increased 40 basis points in 2022 as compared to 2021.

Net revenue increased 20.1 percent in 2022 compared to 2021. The 7.0 percent increase in organic growth was attributable to favorable product pricing, partially offset by lower sales volume. The increase in net revenue from M A was primarily due to the acquisitions of Fourny and Apollo during the first quarter of 2022. The negative currency effect was due to a weaker British pound, Euro and Australian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar. Additionally, net revenue in 2022 was higher than 2021 by 1.9 percent from an additional week of revenue in 2022 as it was a 53 week fiscal year compared to a 52 week fiscal year in 2021. Raw material costs as a percentage of net revenue increased 150 basis points due to higher raw material costs partially offset by higher net revenue. Other manufacturing costs as a percentage of net revenue decreased 160 basis points primarily due to higher net revenue and the impact of acquisitions. SG A expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased 100 basis points also due to higher net revenue.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Total cash and cash equivalents as of December 3, 2022 were 79.9 million compared to 61.8 million as of November 27, 2021. Total long and short-term debt was 1,765.1 million as of December 3, 2022 and 1,616.5 million as of November 27, 2021. 
 
 We believe that cash flows from operating activities will be adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital expenditure needs. In addition, we believe we have the ability to obtain both short-term and long-term debt to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. Cash available in the United States has historically been sufficient and we expect it will continue to be sufficient to fund U.S. operations, U.S. capital spending and U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit contributions in addition to funding U.S. acquisitions, dividend payments, debt service and share repurchases as needed. For those international earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely, we currently have no intention to, and plans do not indicate a need to, repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. 
 
 Our credit agreements include restrictive covenants that, if not met, could lead to a renegotiation of our credit lines and a significant increase in our cost of financing. At December 3, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants of our contractual obligations as shown in the following table:

EBITDA for Term Loan B covenant purposes is defined as consolidated net income, plus interest expense, expense for taxes paid or accrued, depreciation and amortization, certain non-cash impairment losses, extraordinary non-cash losses incurred other than in the ordinary course of business, nonrecurring extraordinary non-cash restructuring charges and the non-cash impact of purchase accounting, expenses related to the Royal Adhesives acquisition not to exceed 40.0 million, expenses relating to the integration of Royal Adhesives during the fiscal years ending in 2017, 2018 and 2019 not exceeding 30 million in aggregate, restructuring expenses that began prior to the Royal Adhesives acquisition incurred in fiscal years ending in 2017 and 2018 not exceeding 28 million in aggregate, and non-capitalized charges relating to the SAP implementation during fiscal years ending in 2017 through 2021 not exceeding 13 million in any single fiscal year, minus extraordinary non-cash gains. For the Total Indebtedness / TTM EBITDA ratio, TTM EBITDA is adjusted for the pro forma results from Material Acquisitions and Material Divestitures as if the acquisition or divestiture occurred at the beginning of the calculation period. The full definition is set forth in the Term Loan B Credit Agreement and can be found in the Company s 8-K filing dated October 20, 2017. 

EBITDA for Revolving Credit Facility covenant purposes is defined as consolidated net income, plus interest expense, expense for taxes paid or accrued, depreciation and amortization, non-cash impairment losses related to long-lived assets, intangible assets or goodwill, nonrecurring or unusual non-cash losses incurred other than in the ordinary course of business, nonrecurring or unusual non-cash restructuring charges and the non-cash impact of purchase accounting, fees, premiums, expenses and other transaction costs incurred or paid by the borrower or any of its Subsidiaries on the effective date in connection with the transactions, this agreement and the other loan documents, the 2020 supplemental indenture and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, one-time, non-capitalized charges and expenses relating to the Company s SAP implementation during fiscal years ending in 2017 through 2024, in an amount not exceeding 15.0 million in any single fiscal year of the Company, charges and expenses relating to the ASP Royal Acquisition, including but not limited to advisory and financing costs, during the Company s fiscal years ending in 2020 and 2021, in an aggregate amount (as to such years combined) not exceeding 40.0 million, charges and expenses related to the reorganization of the Company and its subsidiaries from five business units to three business units to reduce costs during the Company s fiscal years ending in 2020 and 2021 in an aggregate amount (as to such years combined) not exceeding 24.0 million, and charges and expenses related to the Company s manufacturing and operations project to improve delivery, implement cost savings and reduce inventory during the Company s fiscal years ending in 2020, 2021 and 2022 in an aggregate amount (as to such years combined) not exceeding 15.5 million. 

Consolidated Interest Expense for the Revolving Credit Facility is defined as the interest expense (including without limitation the portion of capital lease obligations that constitutes imputed interest in accordance with GAAP) of the Company and its subsidiaries calculated on a consolidated basis for such period with respect to all outstanding indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries allocable to such period in accordance with GAAP.

Of the 79.9 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 3, 2022, 75.2 million was held outside the U.S. Of the 75.2 million of cash held outside the U.S., earnings on 73.3 million are indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. It is not practical for us to determine the U.S. tax implications of the repatriation of these funds. 
 
 There are no contractual or regulatory restrictions on the ability of consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries to transfer funds in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances to us, except for: 1) a credit facility limitation restricting investments, loans, advances or capital contributions from Loan Parties to non-Loan Parties in excess of 100.0 million, 2) a credit facility limitation that provides total investments, loans, advances or guarantees not otherwise permitted in the credit agreement for all subsidiaries shall not exceed 125.0 million in the aggregate, 3) a credit facility limitation that provides total investments, dividends, and distributions shall not exceed the Available Amount defined in these agreements, all three of which do not apply once our secured leverage ratio drops below 4.0x and 4) typical statutory restrictions, which prohibit distributions in excess of net capital or similar tests. The Royal Adhesives acquisition and any investments, loans, and advances established to consummate the Royal Adhesives acquisition, are excluded from the credit facility limitations described above. Additionally, we have taken the income tax position that the majority of our cash in non-U.S. locations is indefinitely reinvested. 
 
 Debt Outstanding and Debt Capacity 
 
 Notes Payable 
 
 Notes payable were 28.9 million at December 3, 2022 and 25.0 million at November 27, 2021. These amounts primarily represented various foreign subsidiaries short-term borrowings that were not part of committed lines. The weighted-average interest rates on these short-term borrowings were 16.2 percent in 2022 and 8.1 percent in 2021. 
 
 Long-Term Debt 
 
 Long-term debt consisted of a secured term loan Term Loan B and two unsecured public notes Public Notes ). The Term Loan B has a principal amount of 1,001.2 million and bears a floating interest rate at LIBOR plus 2.00 percent (6.19 percent at December 3, 2022) and matures in fiscal year 2024. The 10-year Public Notes have a principal amount of 300.0 million, bear fixed interest at 4.00 percent and mature in 2027. We are subject to a par call of 1.00 percent except within three months of the maturity date. The 8-year Public Notes have a principal amount of 300.0 million, bear fixed interest at 4.25 percent and mature in 2028. We are subject to a par call plus 50 percent of coupon in year 4, plus 25 percent of coupon in year 5 and at par thereafter. We currently have no intention to prepay the Public Notes. Additional details on the Public Notes and the Term Loan B Credit Agreement can be found in Form 8-K dated February 9, 2017 , Form 8-K dated October 20, 2017 and Form 8-K dated October 20, 2020 , respectively. Interest payable on our long-term debt totaled 7.4 million as of December 3, 2022. 
 
 We entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert our 300.0 million Public Notes that were issued on October 20, 2020 to a variable interest rate of 1-month LIBOR plus 3.28 percent. We entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert 150.0 million of our 300.0 million Public Notes that were issued on February 14, 2017 to a variable interest rate of 1-month LIBOR plus 1.86 percent. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the issuance of our Public Notes. The swaps were designated for hedge accounting treatment as fair value hedges. We applied the hypothetical derivative method to assess hedge effectiveness for this interest rate swap. Changes in the fair value of a hypothetically perfect swap with terms that match the critical terms of our fixed rate Public Notes are compared with the change in the fair value of the swaps. On May 1, 2020, we terminated the swap agreement. Upon termination, we received 15.8 million in cash. The remaining swap liability will be accounted for as a discount on long-term debt and will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the Public Notes of seven years.

Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 We have a revolving credit agreement with a consortium of financial institutions at December 3, 2022. This revolving credit agreement creates a secured multi-currency revolving credit facility that we can draw upon to repay existing indebtedness, finance working capital needs, finance acquisitions and for general corporate purposes up to a maximum of 700 million. 
 
 On January 24, 2022, we relied on the accordion feature in our credit agreement to increase the commitment under the existing credit facility from 400 million to 600 million. On February 28, 2022, we executed an amendment to amend and restate the revolving credit agreement to move from borrowing under LIBOR to borrowing under SOFR along with further upsizing the revolving credit facility by 100 million to 700 million in total aggregate commitments. Interest on the revolving credit facility is payable at the SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment (0.11448 percent) plus 1.75 percent (5.94 percent at December 3, 2022). A facility fee of 0.25 percent of the unused commitment under the revolving credit facility is payable quarterly. The interest rate and the facility fee are based on a leverage grid. The revolving credit facility expires on July 22, 2024. As of December 3, 2022, we had 175.5 million drawn under the revolving credit facility. Additional details on the revolving credit agreement can be found in Form 8-K dated October 20, 2020 . For further information related to debt outstanding and debt capacity, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Uncertainty relating to the LIBOR phase out may adversely impact the value of, and our obligations under, our Term Loan B and Public Notes. See the applicable discussion under Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
 
 As of December 3, 2022, goodwill totaled 1,392.6 million (31.2 percent of total assets) and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled 702.1 million (15.7 percent of total assets).

 5 Total debt divided by (total debt plus total stockholders equity). 
 
 Free cash flow after dividends, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchased property, plant and equipment and dividends paid. Free cash flow after dividends is an integral financial measure used by the Company to assess its ability to generate cash in excess of its operating needs, therefore, the Company believes this financial measure provides useful information to investors. The following table reflects the manner in which free cash flow after dividends is determined and provides a reconciliation of free cash flow after dividends to net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The lower use of cash in 2022 compared to 2021 was related to higher collections in the current year compared to the prior year. The DSO was 62 days at December 3, 2022 and November 27, 2021. 

Inventory Changes in inventory resulted in a 55.8 million use of cash in 2022 compared to a 135.4 million use of cash in 2021. In 2022, inventory levels increased from 2021 as a result of acquisitions and also reflecting higher raw material costs and efforts to maintain service levels. Inventory days on hand were 71 days at the end of 2022 compared to 65 days at the end of 2021. 

Trade Payables Changes in trade payables resulted in a 22.6 million use of cash in 2022 and a 176.3 million source of cash in 2021. The use of cash in 2022 compared to the source of cash in 2021 primarily related to the timing of payments. 

Contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans were 3.0 million and 3.8 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Income taxes payable resulted in a 12.9 million and a 4.1 million use of cash in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Other asse ts resulted in a 46.5 million source of cash and a 79.1 million use of cash in 2022 and 2021 , respectively. The source of cash in 2022 is primarily driven by an decrease in pension and post-retirement assets related to year-end pension valuation and a decrease in derivative assets . Accrued compensation was a 1.1 million and a 27.7 million source of cash in 2022 and 2021, respectivel y, relating to higher accruals for our employee incentive plans. Ot her operating activity was a 6.2 million and a 108.6 million source of cash in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Other operating activity includ es equity adjustments of approximately 25.0) million and 55.0 million related to year-end pension valuations in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors 
 
 The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may be identified by the use of words like "plan," "expect," "aim," "believe," "project," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "will," "should," "could" (including the negative or variations thereof) and other expressions that indicate future events and trends. These plans and expectations are based upon certain underlying assumptions, including those mentioned with the specific statements. Such assumptions are in turn based upon internal estimates and analyses of current market conditions and trends, our plans and strategies, economic conditions and other factors. These plans and expectations and the assumptions underlying them are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions and results. Actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements if one or more of the underlying assumptions and expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized. In addition to the factors described in this report, Item 1A. Risk Factors identifies some of the important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in any such forward-looking statements. In order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor, we have identified these important factors which could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors should be considered, together with any similar risk factors or other cautionary language that may be made elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 The list of important factors in Item 1A. Risk Factors does not necessarily present the risk factors in order of importance. This disclosure, including that under Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors, and other forward-looking statements and related disclosures made by us in this report and elsewhere from time to time, represents our best judgment as of the date the information is given. We do not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. Investors are advised, however, to consult any further public company disclosures (such as in filings with the SEC or in our press releases) on related subjects.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates and prices of raw materials. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. 
 
 Our financial performance may be negatively affected by unfavorable economic conditions. Recessionary economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our sales volumes, pricing levels and profitability. As domestic and international economic conditions change, trends in discretionary consumer spending also become unpredictable and subject to reductions due to uncertainties about the future. A general reduction in consumer discretionary spending due to a recession in the domestic and international economies, or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Exposure to changes in interest rates results primarily from borrowing activities used to fund operations. Committed floating rate credit facilities are used to fund a portion of operations. We believe that probable near-term changes in interest rates would not materially affect financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The annual impact on interest expense of a one-percentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of our variable rate debt, net of interest rate swap derivatives as of December 3, 2022, would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately 10.7 million or 0.19 per diluted share. 
 
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 
 As a result of being a global enterprise, there is exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our operating results, financial condition and net investment in foreign subsidiaries are subject to both currency translation and currency transaction risk. Approximately 55 percent of net revenue was generated outside of the United States in 2022. Principal foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Australian dollar, Argentine peso, Brazilian real, Colombian peso, Mexican peso, Turkish lira, Egyptian pound, Indian rupee, Indonesian rupiah and Malaysian ringgit. 
 
 We enter into cross border transactions through importing and exporting goods to and from different countries and locations. These transactions generate foreign exchange risk as they create assets, liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than their functional currency. This also applies to services provided and other cross border agreements among subsidiaries. Our objective is to balance, where possible, non-functional currency denominated assets to non-functional currency denominated liabilities to have a natural hedge and minimize foreign exchange impacts. 
 
 In the event a natural hedge is not available, we take steps to minimize risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative instruments. We do not enter into any speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments. 
 
 Based on 2022 financial results, a hypothetical one percent change in our cost of sales due to foreign currency rate changes would have resulted in a change in net income attributable to H.B. Fuller of approximately 10.5 million or 0.19 per diluted share. Based on 2022 financial results and foreign currency balance sheet positions as of December 3, 2022, a hypothetical overall 10 percent change in the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately 16.4 million or 0.30 per diluted share. 
 
 Raw Materials 
 
 The principal raw materials used to manufacture products include resins, polymers, synthetic rubbers, vinyl acetate monomer and plasticizers. We generally avoid sole source supplier arrangements for raw materials. While alternate supplies of most key raw materials are available, unplanned supplier production outages may lead to strained supply-demand situations for several key raw materials such as ethylene and propylene, several polymers and other petroleum derivatives such as waxes. 
 
 The purchase of raw materials is our largest expenditure. Our objective is to purchase raw materials that meet both our quality standards and production needs at the lowest total cost. Most raw materials are purchased on the open market or under contracts that limit the frequency but not the magnitude of price increases. In some cases, however, the risk of raw material price changes is managed by strategic sourcing agreements which limit price increases to increases in supplier feedstock costs, while requiring decreases as feedstock costs decline. The leverage of having substitute raw materials approved for use wherever possible is used to minimize the impact of possible price increases. Based on 2022 financial results, a hypothetical one percent change in our raw material costs would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately 15.7 million or 0.28 per diluted share. 
 
 See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on raw material cost and availability.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of H.B. Fuller Company 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of H.B. Fuller Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 3, 2022 and November 27, 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, total equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 3, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 3, 2022 and November 27, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 3, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 3, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January 24, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 

Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments.

Valuation of Goodwill for the Construction Adhesives reporting unit 
 
 Description of the Matter 
 
 At December 3, 2022, the Company had goodwill of approximately 425.8 million related to the Construction Adhesive reporting unit. As discussed in Notes 1 and 5 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company performs goodwill impairment testing on an annual basis as of the beginning of the fourth quarter, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. 
 
 Auditing management s goodwill impairment test for the Construction Adhesives reporting unit was complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. In particular, the Company estimates fair value using the income approach which is sensitive to certain assumptions, such as forecasted revenue and related revenue growth rate, the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margins rate, and the weighted average cost of capital which are affected by management s business plans and expectations about future market or economic conditions. 
 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 
 We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's goodwill impairment review process, including controls over management s review of the significant assumptions described above. 
 
 To test the estimated fair value of the Construction Adhesive reporting unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the valuation methodology used by management and testing the significant assumptions discussed above, as well as the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. For example, we compared the significant assumptions used by management in the prospective financial information to current industry, market and economic trends as well as other relevant factors. We assessed the reasonableness of the forecasted future revenue growth rate and EBITDA margins rate by comparing the forecasts to historical results. We involved our valuation specialists to assist in our evaluation of the valuation models, methodologies and significant assumptions used by the Company, specifically the weighted average cost of capital.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of H.B. Fuller Company 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

We have audited H.B. Fuller Company and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 3, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, H.B. Fuller Company and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 3, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 3, 2022 and November 27, 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, total equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 3, 2022, and the related notes, and our report dated January 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

We evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter or earlier upon the occurrence of substantive unfavorable changes in economic conditions, industry trends, costs, cash flows, or ongoing declines in market capitalization. The quantitative impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting units, and the determination of fair value of each reporting unit. The impairment test requires the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. In performing the impairment test, we determined the fair value of our reporting units through the income approach by using DCF analyses. Determining fair value requires the company to make judgments about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis for each reporting unit are based on the reporting unit's budget, long-term business plan and recent operating performance. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and market conditions. Based on the analysis performed during the fourth quarter of 2022 , there were no indications of impairment for any of our reporting units.

 On February 27, 2018, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert of our Term Loan B to a fixed rate of percent. During the second quarter of 2021, we settled a portion of this interest rate swap as the debt underlying this swap was less than the swap value due to debt paydown. We settled the ineffective portion of the interest rate swap by making a cash payment of and recorded that payment to interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income during the second quarter of 2021. On October 20, 2017, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert , which was amortized down to on October 20, 2021, of our Term Loan B to a fixed interest rate of .

percent. Incentive stock options are based on certain performance-based criteria and are generally exercisable at a stated date when the performance criteria is measured. Stock options generally have a contractual term of years. Options exercised represent newly issued shares. 
 
 Restricted stock awards are nonvested stock-based awards that include grants of restricted stock units. Restricted stock awards are independent of option grants and are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the release of the restrictions. Such awards generally vest beginning one year from the date of grant or percent per year for three years, depending on the grant. During the vesting period, ownership of the shares cannot be transferred. 
 
 Restricted stock units have dividend equivalent rights equal to the cash dividend paid on restricted stock shares. However, restricted stock units do not have voting rights of common stock and are not considered issued and outstanding upon grant. Restricted stock units become newly issued shares when vested. The dividend equivalent rights for restricted stock units are forfeitable. 
 
 We expense the cost, which is the grant date fair market value, of the restricted stock units ratably over the period during which the restrictions lapse. The grant date fair value is our closing stock price on the date of grant. 
 
 We are required to recognize compensation expense when an employee is eligible to retire. We consider employees eligible to retire at age 55 and after 10 years of service. Awards granted to retirement-eligible employees are forfeited if the retirement-eligible employees retire prior to 180 days after the grant. Accordingly, the related compensation expense is recognized during the 180 day period for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, if less than the stated vesting period.

 This plan allows non-employee directors to defer all or a portion of their retainer and meeting fees in a number of investment choices, including units representing shares of our common stock. We provide a percent match on deferred compensation invested in these units. These units are required to be paid out in our common stock. 

Key Employee Deferred Compensation Plan 
 
 This plan allows key employees to defer a portion of their eligible compensation in a number of investment choices, including units representing shares of company common stock. We provide a percent match on deferred compensation invested in these units. 
 
 Grant-Date Fair Value 
 
 We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the grant-date fair value of stock option awards. The fair value of options granted during 2022, 2021 and 2020 were calculated using the following assumptions: 

Weighted-average expected volatility 
 Expected volatility range - - - 
 Risk-free interest rate - - - 
 Weighted-average expected dividend 
 Expected dividend yield range - - - 
 Weighted-average fair value of grants 

Expected life We use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected life assumption for the Black-Scholes grant-date valuation. We believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option. We use a weighted-average expected life for all awards. 
 
 Expected volatility Volatility is calculated using our stock s historical volatility for the same period of time as the expected life. We have no reason to believe that its future volatility will differ from the past. 
 
 Risk-free interest rate The rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant for the same period of time as the expected life. 
 
 Expected dividend yield The calculation is based on the total expected annual dividend payout divided by the average stock price. 
 
 Expense 
 
 We use the straight-line attribution method to recognize share-based compensation expense for option awards and restricted stock units with graded and cliff vesting. Incentive stock options and performance awards are based on certain performance-based metrics and the expense is adjusted quarterly, based on our projections of the achievement of those metrics. The amount of share-based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. The expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which for us is the period between the grant date and the earlier of the award s stated vesting term or the date the employee is eligible for early vesting based on the terms of the plans. 
 
 Total share-based compensation expense was , and for 2022, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. All share-based compensation was recorded as SG A expense. 
 
 As of December 3, 2022 , of unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock option awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years. Unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested restricted stock units was which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years.

percent of their pre-tax earnings to a 401 (k) plan, subject to IRS limitations. We match up to the first percent of each employee's pre-tax earnings, based on the employee s contributions. All U.S. employees are eligible for a separate annual non-discretionary retirement contribution to the 401 (k) plan of percent of pay, that is invested based on the election of the individual participant.

 Defined Benefit Plans 
 
 Noncontributory defined benefit pension plans cover all U.S. employees employed prior to January 1, 2007. Benefits for these plans are based primarily on each employee s years of service and average compensation. During 2011, we made significant changes to our U.S. pension plan. The changes included: benefits under the plan were locked-in using service and salary as of May 31, 2011, participants no longer earn benefits for future service and salary as they had in the past, affected participants receive a three percent increase to the locked-in benefit for every year they continue to work for us and we are making a retirement contribution of three percent of eligible compensation to the 401 (k) Plan for those participants. The funding policy is consistent with the funding requirements of federal law and regulations. Plan assets consist principally of listed equity securities and bonds. During 2020, we amended the U.S. pension plan to add a program for eligible employees to take a lump sum distribution. amounts were paid under this program in 2022 and a total of was paid during 2021 as distributions under this program. Other U.S. postretirement benefits are funded through a Voluntary Employees' Beneficiaries Association Trust. 
 
 Health care and life insurance benefits are provided for eligible retired employees and their eligible dependents. These benefits are provided through various insurance companies and health care providers. Costs are accrued during the years the employee renders the necessary service. 
 
 Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries provide pension benefits for their employees consistent with local practices and regulations. These plans are primarily defined benefit plans covering substantially all employees upon completion of a specified period of service. Benefits for these plans are generally based on years of service and annual compensation.

1 Under the U.S. pension plan, the compensation amount was locked-in as of May 31, 2011 and thus the benefit no longer includes compensation increases. The percent rate for 2020 is for the supplemental executive retirement plan only; for and since 2021, there has been compensation increase as subsequent to November 27, 2021, there were no active employees in the supplemental executive retirement plan. 
 
 The discount rate assumption is determined using an actuarial yield curve approach, which results in a discount rate that reflects the characteristics of the plan. The approach identifies a broad population of corporate bonds that meet the quality and size criteria for the particular plan. We use this approach rather than a specific index that has a certain set of bonds that may or may not be representative of the characteristics of our particular plan. A higher discount rate reduces the present value of the pension obligations. The discount rate for the U.S. pension plan was percent at December 3, 2022 , percent at November 27, 2021 and percent at November 28, 2020 . Net periodic pension cost for a given fiscal year is based on assumptions developed at the end of the previous fiscal year. A discount rate change of percentage points at December 3, 2022 would impact U.S. pension and other postretirement plan (income) expense by approximately (pre-tax) in fiscal 2023. Discount rates for non-U.S. plans are determined in a manner consistent with the U.S. plans. 
 
 For the U.S. pension plan, we adopte d the Adjusted Pri- 2012 base mortality table projected generationally using scale MP- 2021. 
 
 The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption for the U.S. pension plan was percent in 2022 , percent in 2021 and in 2020 . Our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets was based on our target asset allocation assumption of percent equities and percent fixed-income. Management, in conjunction with our external financial advisors, determines the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by considering the expected future returns and volatility levels for each asset class that are based on historical returns and forward-looking observations. For 2022 , the expected long-term rate of return on the target equities allocation was p ercent and the expected long-term rate of return on the target fixed-income allocation was percent. The total plan rate of return assumption included an estimate of the effect of diversification and the plan expense. A change of percentage points for the expected return on assets assumption would impact U.S. net pension and other postretirement plan expense by approxi mately (pre-tax). 
 
 Management, in conjunction with our external financial advisors, uses the actual historical rates of return of the asset categories to assess the reasonableness of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. 
 
 The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption for non-U.S. pension plans was a weighted-average of percent in 2022 compared to percent in 2021 and percent in 2020 . The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption used in each non-U.S. plan is determined on a plan-by-plan basis for each local jurisdiction and is based on expected future returns for the investment mix of assets currently in the portfolio for that plan. Management, in conjunction with our external financial advisors, develops expected rates of return for each plan, considers expected long-term returns for each asset category in the plan, reviews expectations for inflation for each local jurisdiction, and estimates the effect of active management of the plan s assets. Our largest non-U.S. pension plans are in the United Kingdom and Germany. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for the United Kingdom was percent and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for Germany was percent. Management, in conjunction with our external financial advisors, uses actual historical returns of the asset portfolio to assess the reasonableness of the expected rate of return for each plan.

Plan Asset Management 
 
 Plan assets are held in trust and invested in mutual funds, separately managed accounts and other commingled investment vehicles holding U.S. and non-U.S. equity securities, fixed income securities and other investment classes. We employ a total return approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk. Futures and options may also be used to enhance risk-adjusted long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification and duration. Risk management is accomplished through diversification across asset classes, utilization of multiple investment managers and general plan-specific investment policies. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of the plan liabilities, plan funded status and our assessment of our overall liquidity position. This asset allocation policy mix is reviewed annually and actual versus target allocations are monitored regularly and rebalanced on an as-needed basis. Plan assets are invested using a combination of active and passive investment strategies. Passive, or indexed strategies, attempt to mimic rather than exceed the investment performance of a market benchmark. The plans active investment strategies employ multiple investment management firms which in aggregate cover a range of investment styles and approaches. Performance is monitored and compared to relevant benchmarks on a regular basis. 
 
 The U.S. pension plans consist of two plans: a pension plan and a supplemental executive retirement plan SERP ). There were assets in the SERP in 2022 and 2021 . Consequently, all of the data disclosed in the asset allocation table for the U.S. pension plans pertain to our U.S. pension plan. 
 
 During 2022 , we maintained our assets within the allowed ranges of the target asset alloca tion mix of percent equities and pe rcent fixed income plus or minus 5 percent and continued our focus to reduce volatility of plan assets in future periods and to more closely match the duration of the assets with the duration of the liabilities of the plan. 
 
 The non-U.S. pension plans consist of all the pension plans administered by us outside the U.S., principally consisting of plans in Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Canada. During 2022 , we maintained our assets for the non-U.S. pension plans at the specific target asset allocation mix determined for each plan plus or minus the allowed rate and continued our focus to reduce volatility of plan assets in future periods and to more closely match the duration of the assets with the duration of the liabilities of the individual plans. We plan to maintain the portfolios at their respective target asset allocations in 2023. 
 
 Other postretirement benefits plans consist of two U.S. plans: a retiree medical health care plan and a group term life insurance plan. There were assets in the group term life insurance plan for 2022 and 2021 . Consequently, all of the data disclosed in the asset allocation table for other postretirement plans pertain to our retiree medical health care plan. Our investment strategy for other postretirement benefit plans is to own insurance policies that maintain an asset allocation nearly completely in equities. These equities are invested in a passive portfolio indexed to the S P 500.

 The definitions of fair values of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets at December 3, 2022 and November 27, 2021 by asset category are as follows: 
 
 Equities Primarily publicly traded common stock for purposes of total return and to maintain equity exposure consistent with policy allocations. Investments include: (i) U.S. and non-U.S. equity securities and mutual funds valued at closing prices from national exchanges; and (ii) commingled funds valued at unit values or net asset values provided by the investment managers, which are based on the fair value of the underlying investments. Funds valued at net asset value have various investment strategies including seeking maximum total returns consistent with prudent investment management, seeking current income consistent with preservation of capital and daily liquidity and seeking to approximate the risk and return characterized by a specific index fund. There are no restrictions for redeeming holdings out of these funds and the funds have no unfunded commitments. 
 
 Fixed income Primarily corporate and government debt securities for purposes of total return and managing fixed income exposure to policy allocations. Investments include (i) mutual funds valued at closing prices from national exchanges, (ii) corporate and government debt securities valued at closing prices from national exchanges, (iii) commingled funds valued at unit values or net asset value provided by the investment managers, which are based on the fair value of the underlying investments, and (iv) an annuity contract, the value of which is determined by the provider and represents the amount the plan would receive if the contract were cashed out at year-end. 
 
 Insurance Insurance contracts for purposes of funding postretirement medical benefits. Fair values are the cash surrender values as determined by the providers which are the amounts the plans would receive if the contracts were cashed out at year end. 
 
 Cash Cash balances on hand, accrued income and pending settlements of transactions for purposes of handling plan payments. Fair values are the cash balances as reported by the Trustees of the plans.

The difference between the change in the deferred tax assets in the balance sheet and the deferred tax provision is primarily due to the defined benefit pension plan adjustment and floating-to-fixed hedges recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). 
 
 Valuation allowances primarily relate to foreign net operating loss carryforwards and branch foreign tax credit carryforwards where the future potential benefits do not meet the more-likely-than- not realization test. The increase in the valuation allowance is primarily related to a decrease in foreign net operating losses for which the Company does not expect to receive a full tax benefit. 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more-likely-than- not to be realized. We believe it is more-likely-than- not that reversal of deferred tax liabilities and forecasted income will be sufficient to fully recover the net deferred tax assets not already offset by a valuation allowance. In the event that all or part of the gross deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. 
 
 U.S. income taxes have not been provided on approximately of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. We intend to indefinitely reinvest these undistributed earnings. Cash available in the United States has historically been sufficient and we expect it will continue to be sufficient to fund U.S. cash flow requirements. In the event these earnings are later distributed to the U.S., such distributions would likely result in additional U.S. tax. 
 
 While non-U.S. operations have been profitable overall, there are cumulative tax losses of in various countries. These tax losses can be carried forward to offset the income tax liabilities on future income in these countries. Cumulative tax losses of can be carried forward indefinitely, while the remaining of tax losses must be utilized during 2023 to 2040. 
 
 The U.S. has a branch foreign tax credit carryforward of . A valuation allowance has been recorded against this foreign tax credit carryforward to reflect that this amount is not more-likely-than- not to be realized. 
 
 The table below sets forth the changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefit as a result of uncertain tax positions, excluding accrued interest. We do not anticipate that the total unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly within the next twelve months.

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 3, 2022 and November 27, 2021 are potential benefits of and respectively, that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. 
 
 We report accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. For the year ended December 3, 2022 , we recognized a net benefit for interest and penalties of relating to unrecognized tax benefits and had net accumulated accrued interest and penalties of as of December 3, 2022 . For the year ended November 27, 2021 , we recognized a net benefit for interest and penalties of relating to unrecognized tax benefits and had net accumulated accrued interest and penalties of as of November 27, 2021 . 
 
 We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in numerous state and foreign jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal tax examination for years prior to 2019 or Swiss income tax examination for years prior to 2018. During the second quarter of 2016, H.B. Fuller (China) Adhesives, Ltd. was notified of a transfer pricing audit covering the calendar years 2005 through 2014. We are in various stages of examination and appeal in other foreign jurisdictions. Although the final outcomes of these examinations cannot currently be determined, we believe that we have recorded adequate liabilities with respect to these examinations. 

Cash Flow Hedges 
 
 October 20, 2017, we entered into four cross-currency swap agreements to convert a notional amount of of foreign currency denominated intercompany loans into U.S. dollars, which matured on October 20, 2022. The swaps were designated as cash flow hedges for accounting treatment. The lesser amount between the cumulative change in the fair value of the actual swaps and the cumulative change in the fair value of hypothetical swaps is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and in other net cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The differences between the cumulative change in the fair value of the actual swaps and the cumulative change in the fair value of hypothetical swaps are recorded as other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. In a perfectly effective hedge relationship, the two fair value calculations would exactly offset each other. Any difference in the calculation represents hedge ineffectiveness. 
 
 On February 27, 2018, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert of our Term Loan B to a fixed interest rate of percent. During the second quarter of 2021, we settled a portion of this interest rate swap as the debt underlying this swap was less than the swap value due to debt paydown. We settled the ineffective portion of the interest rate swap by making a cash payment of and recorded that payment to interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income during the second quarter of 2021. On October 20, 2017, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert , which amortized down to on October 20, 2021, of our Term Loan B to a fixed interest rate of percent. These interest rate swap agreements matured on October 20, 2022 and we have no interest rate swap agreements on our Term Loan B as of December 3, 2022 . 
 
 The amounts of pretax gains (losses) recognized in comprehensive income related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are as follows: 
 Interest rate swap contracts 
 Net investment hedges 

Fair Value Hedges 
 
 On February 12, 2021, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert our Public Notes that were issued on October 20, 2020 to a variable interest rate of 1 -month LIBOR plus percent. See Note 7 for further discussion on the issuance of our Public Notes. These interest rate swap agreements mature on October 15, 2028. The combined fair value of the interest rate swaps was a liabilit y of at December 3, 2022 , and was included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The swaps were designated for hedge accounting treatment as fair value hedges. We apply the short cut method and assume hedge effectiveness. Changes in the fair value of a hypothetically perfect swap with terms that match the critical terms of our fixed rate Public Notes are compared with the change in the fair value of the swaps. On February 14, 2017, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert of our Public Notes that were issued on February 14, 2017 to a variable interest rate of 1 -month LIBOR plus percent. The swap was designated for hedge accounting treatment as fair value hedges. We applied the hypothetical derivative method to assess hedge effectiveness for this interest rate swap. Changes in the fair value of a hypothetically perfect swap with terms that match the critical terms of our fixed rate Public Notes are compared with the change in the fair value of the swaps. On May 1, 2020, we terminated the swap agreement. Upon termination, we received in cash. The remaining swap liability will be accounted for as a discount on long-term debt and will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the Public Notes of seven years.

 On October 17, 2022, we entered into a float-to-float cross-currency interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 307,173 maturing in October 2028. On October 20, 2022, we entered into fixed-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of 300,000 with tranches maturing in August 2025, August 2026 and February 2027. As of December 3, 2022, the combined fair value of the swaps was a liability of and was included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cross-currency interest rate swaps hedge a portion of the Company s investment in Euro denominated foreign subsidiaries. 
 
 The swaps are designated as net investment hedges for accounting treatment. The net gains or losses attributable to changes in spot exchange rates are recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment within other comprehensive income (loss). The gains or losses are reclassified into earnings upon a liquidation event or deconsolidation of the foreign subsidiary. Any ineffective portions of net investment hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings during the period of change. The amount in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to net investment hedge cross-currency swaps was a loss of as of December 3, 2022 . In 2022, the Company did not reclassify any gains or losses into earnings from net investment hedges and we do not expect to reclassify any such gain or loss into earnings within the next twelve months. No amounts related to net investment hedges have been excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. 
 
 Derivatives Not Designated As Hedging Instruments 
 
 The company uses foreign currency forward contracts to offset its exposure to the change in value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities held at foreign subsidiaries that are remeasured at the end of each period. Although the contracts are effective economic hedges, they are not designated as accounting hedges. Foreign currency forward contracts are recorded as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. See Note 13 for fair value amounts of these derivative instruments. 
 
 As of December 3, 2022 , we had forward foreign currency contracts maturing betwee n December 5, 2022 and November 21, 2023. The mark-to-market effect associated with these contracts was largely offset by the underlying transaction gains and losses resulting from the foreign currency exposures for which these contracts relate. 
 
 The amounts of pretax gains (losses) recognized in other income, net related to derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are as follows: 

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of entities in the customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and countries. As of December 3, 2022 , there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.

Balances Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
 
 We measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets include intangible assets acquired in an acquisition. The identified intangible assets of customer relationships, technology and tradenames acquired in connection with our acquisitions were measured using unobservable (Level 3 inputs. The fair value of the intangible assets was calculated using either the income or cost approach. Significant inputs include estimated revenue growth rates, gross margins, operating expenses, attrition rate, royalty rate and discount rate.

and as of December 3, 2022 and November 27, 2021 , respectively, for probable and reasonably estimable environmental remediation costs. Of the amount reserved, and as of December 3, 2022 and November 27, 2021 , respectively, is attributable to a facility we own in Simpsonville, South Carolina as a result of our Royal Adhesives acquisition that is a designated site under CERCLA. 
 
 Currently we are involved in various environmental investigations, clean up activities and administrative proceedings and lawsuits. In particular, we are currently deemed a PRP in conjunction with numerous other parties, in a number of government enforcement actions associated with landfills and/or hazardous waste sites. As a PRP, we may be required to pay a share of the costs of investigation and clean up of these sites. In addition, we are engaged in environmental remediation and monitoring efforts at a number of current and former operating facilities. While uncertainties exist with respect to the amounts and timing of the ultimate environmental liabilities, based on currently available information, we have concluded that these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow. 
 
 Other Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time and in the ordinary course of business, we are a party to, or a target of, lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, contract, patent and intellectual property, environmental, health and safety, tax and employment matters. While we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters, we have concluded, based upon currently available information, that the ultimate resolution of any pending matter, individually or in the aggregate, including the asbestos litigation described in the following paragraphs, will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow. 
 
 We have been named as a defendant in lawsuits in which plaintiffs have alleged injury due to products containing asbestos manufactured more than 35 years ago. The plaintiffs generally bring these lawsuits against multiple defendants and seek damages (both actual and punitive) in very large amounts. In many cases, plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable injuries or that the injuries suffered were the result of exposure to products manufactured by us. We are typically dismissed as a defendant in such cases without payment. If the plaintiff presents evidence indicating that compensable injury occurred as a result of exposure to our products, the case is generally settled for an amount that reflects the seriousness of the injury, the length, intensity and character of exposure to products containing asbestos, the number and solvency of other defendants in the case, and the jurisdiction in which the case has been brought. 
 
 A significant portion of the defense costs and settlements in asbestos-related litigation is paid by third parties, including indemnification pursuant to the provisions of a 1976 agreement under which we acquired a business from a third party. Currently, this third party is defending and paying settlement amounts, under a reservation of rights, in most of the asbestos cases tendered to the third party. 
 
 In addition to the indemnification arrangements with third parties, we have insurance policies that generally provide coverage for asbestos liabilities, including defense costs. Historically, insurers have paid a significant portion of our defense costs and settlements in asbestos-related litigation. However, certain of our insurers are insolvent. We have entered into cost-sharing agreements with our insurers that provide for the allocation of defense costs and settlements and judgments in asbestos-related lawsuits. These agreements require, among other things, that we fund a share of settlements and judgments allocable to years in which the responsible insurer is insolvent. 
 
 A summary of the number of and settlement amounts for asbestos-related lawsuits and claims is as follows: 

Settlement amounts 
 Insurance payments received or expected to be received 

We do not believe that it would be meaningful to disclose the aggregate number of asbestos-related lawsuits filed against us because relatively few of these lawsuits are known to involve exposure to asbestos-containing products that we manufactured. Rather, we believe it is more meaningful to disclose the number of lawsuits that are settled and result in a payment to the plaintiff. To the extent we can reasonably estimate the amount of our probable liabilities for pending asbestos-related claims, we establish a financial provision and a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries. 
 
 Based on currently available information, we have concluded that the resolution of any pending matter, including asbestos-related litigation, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow. 

reportable segments: Hygiene, Health and Consumable Adhesives, Engineering Adhesives and Construction Adhesives. The business components within each operating segment are managed to maximize the results of the overall operating segment rather than the results of any individual business component of the operating segment. Results of individual components of each operating segment are subject to numerous allocations of segment-wide costs that may or may not have been focused on that particular component for a particular reporting period. The costs for these allocated resources are not tracked on a where-used basis as financial performance is assessed at the total operating segment level.

 As of the end of the period covered by this report, management conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act )). Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that, as of December 3, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective (1) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (2) to ensure that information require to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to us, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 
 
 Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 3, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013 Framework) . Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of December 3, 2022, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective. Ernst and Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 3, 2022, which is included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
