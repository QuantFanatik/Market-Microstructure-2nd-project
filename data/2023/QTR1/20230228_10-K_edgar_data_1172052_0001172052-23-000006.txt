 Our Competitive Strengths We Have Strong Relationships with Independent Agents.

For that reason, our strategy is centered around, and we sell exclusively through, a network of independent agents.

 Our Strategy To achieve our goal of increasing shareholder value, our strategy is to maintain and develop strong independent agent relationships by providing our agents with a full package of insurance products and information technology services. We believe this strategy will allow us to: further penetrate the Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine markets in all lines of business; implement rates, forms and billing options that allow us to cross-sell private passenger automobile, homeowners, dwelling fire, and personal umbrella policies in the personal lines market and commercial automobile, business owner policies, commercial property package and commercial umbrella policies in the commercial lines market in order to capture a larger share of the total Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine property and casualty insurance business written by each of our independent agents; and continue to expand our technology to enable independent agents to more easily serve their customers and conduct business with us, thereby strengthening their relationships with us. Property and Casualty Insurance Market Introduction. We are licensed by the respective state insurance departments to transact property and casualty insurance in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine. All of our business is regulated by these departments, with the most extensive oversight from our domestic regulator, the Massachusetts Division of Insurance Division ). Products Historically, we have focused on underwriting private passenger automobile insurance, which is written through our subsidiary, Safety Insurance. In 1989, we formed Safety Indemnity to offer commercial automobile insurance at preferred rates. Since 1997, we have expanded the breadth of our product line in order for agents to address a greater portion of their clients insurance needs by selling multiple products. Homeowners, business owner, personal umbrella, dwelling fire and commercial umbrella insurance policies are written by Safety Insurance at standard rates and written by Safety Indemnity at preferred rates. In December 2006, we formed Safety P C to offer homeowners and commercial automobile insurance. In November 2020, we formed Safety Northeast to offer at ultra preferred rates, which became licensed to write homeowners insurance products in Massachusetts. The table below shows our premiums in each of these product lines for the periods indicated and the portions of our total premiums each product line represented.

 Reauthorization Act of 2007, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization of 2015 and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019. See Reinsurance, discussed below. Distribution We distribute our products exclusively through independent agents, unlike some of our competitors who use multiple distribution channels. We believe this gives us a competitive advantage with the agents. With the exception of personal automobile business assigned to us by the Massachusetts Automobile Insurance Plan MAIP or written through CAR s commercial automobile Servicing Carrier program, we do not accept business from insurance brokers. Our voluntary agents have authority pursuant to our voluntary agency agreement to bind our Insurance Subsidiaries for any coverage that is within the scope of their authority. We reserve the ability to cancel any coverage bound, in accordance with applicable law. In total, our independent agents numbered 843 and had 1,071 offices (some agencies have more than one office) and approximately 10,015 customer service representatives during 2022. Voluntary Agents. In 2022, we obtained approximately 96.5 of our direct written premiums for automobile insurance and 100 of our direct written premiums for all of our other lines of business through our voluntary agents. As of December 31, 2022, we had agreements with 739 voluntary agents. Our voluntary agents are located in all regions of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine. We look for agents with profitable portfolios of business. To become a voluntary agent for our Company, we generally require that an agency: (i) have been in business for at least five years; (ii) have exhibited a three year private passenger average ratio of losses, excluding loss adjustment expenses, to net earned premiums pure loss ratio of 65.0 or less on the portion of the agent s portfolio that we would underwrite; (iii) make a commitment for us to underwrite at least 300 policies from the agency during the first twelve months after entering an agreement with us; and (iv) offer multiple product lines. Every year, we review the prior year performance of our agents. If an agent fails to meet our profitability standards, we try to work with the agent to improve the profitability of the business it places with us. We generally terminate contracts each year with a few agencies, which, despite our efforts, have been consistently unable to meet our standards. Although independent agents usually represent several unrelated insurers, our goal is to be one of the top two insurance companies represented in each of our agencies, as measured by direct written premiums. No individual agency generated more than 8.7 of our direct written premiums in 2022. Massachusetts law guarantees that CAR provides motor vehicle insurance coverage to all eligible risks. Under the MAIP, personal automobile policies are assigned to us for three years, unless the policyholder is offered a voluntary policy by another insurer. All Massachusetts agents are authorized to submit eligible business to the MAIP for random assignment to a carrier such as Safety Insurance. We are allocated all private passenger residual market business through the MAIP. CAR runs a reinsurance pool for ceded commercial automobile policies through the Commercial Automobile Program (the Commercial Automobile Program ). CAR has appointed Safety and three other servicing carriers to process ceded commercial automobile insurance. Safety was reappointed for this program on January 1, 2022 for an additional five-year term. Historically, CAR ran a separate reinsurance pool for Taxi, Limousine and Car Service risks; however, beginning with the January 1, 2022 policy year, this pool was combined into the Commercial Automobile Program. Approximately 190,000 of ceded premium is spread equitably among the four servicing carriers. Subject to the review of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Insurance the Commissioner ), CAR sets the premium rates for commercial automobile policies reinsured through CAR and this reinsurance pool can generate an underwriting result that is a profit or deficit based upon CAR s rate level. This underwriting result is allocated among every Massachusetts commercial automobile insurance company, including us, based on a company s commercial automobile voluntary market share.

 We are assigned independent agents by CAR who can submit commercial business to us in the Commercial Automobile Program and the Taxi/Limo Program, and we classify those agents as Exclusive Representative Producers ERPs ).

In addition, 81.9 of our homeowners policyholders had a matching automobile policy with us in 2022 compared to 82.6 in 2021 and 82.8 in 2020. Marketing We view the independent agent as our customer and business partner. As a result, a component of our marketing efforts focuses on developing interdependent relationships with leading Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine agents that write profitable business and positioning ourselves as the preferred insurance carrier of those agents, thereby receiving a larger portion of each agent s aggregate business. Our principal marketing strategies to agents are: to offer a range of products, which we believe enables our agents to meet the insurance needs of their clients; to price our products competitively, including offering discounts when and where appropriate for safer drivers for our personal automobile products, loss-free credits for our homeowner products, paperless e-Customer discounts, and also offering account discounts for policyholders that have more than one policy with us; to design, price and market our products to our agents for their customers to place all their insurance with us; to offer agents competitive commissions, with incentives for placing their more profitable business with us; and to provide a level of support and service that enhances the agent s ability to do business with its clients and with us.

 We have a comprehensive branding campaign using a variety of radio, television, digital, social and print advertisements. Commission Schedule and Profit Sharing Plan. We have several programs designed to attract profitable new business from agents by paying them competitive commissions. We recognize our top performing agents by making them members of either our Chairman s Elite, Chairman s, President s, Executive s or Preferred Agent s Club. Further, we have a competitive agency incentive commission program under which we pay agents a percentage of premiums based on the loss ratio on their business. Service and Support. We believe that the level and quality of service and support we provide helps differentiate us from other insurers. We have made a significant investment in information technology designed to facilitate our agents business. Our Agents Virtual Community website helps agents manage their work efficiently. We provide a substantial amount of information online that agents need to serve their customers, such as information about the status of new policies, bill payments and claims. We are also committed to providing our agents with new information through our Resource Center articles on SafetyInsurance.com to keep their customers informed on how to best protect their auto, home and business. Providing this type of content reduces the number of customer calls we receive and empowers the agent s customer service representatives by enabling them to respond to customers inquiries while the customer is on the telephone. Finally, we believe that the knowledge and experience of our employees enhances the quality of support we provide. Underwriting and Insurance Operations Our underwriting department is responsible for a number of key decisions affecting the profitability of our business, including: pricing of our private passenger automobile, commercial automobile, homeowners, dwelling fire, personal umbrella, business owner, and commercial umbrella policies; developing new products, coverages, forms and discounts, as well as expansion into new states; determining underwriting guidelines for all our products; and evaluating whether to accept transfers of a portion of an existing or potential new agent s portfolio from another insurer. 
 Pricing. Subject to the applicable state insurance department s review, we set rates for all of our products using our own loss experience, industry loss cost data, residual market deficits, catastrophe modeling and prices charged by our competitors. We have four pricing segments for most products, utilizing Safety Insurance for standard rates, Safety Indemnity for preferred rates, Safety Northeast for ultra preferred rates and Safety P C for high value homeowners rates. Massachusetts Residual Automobile Insurance Markets. CAR establishes the rates for personal automobile policies assigned to carriers through the MAIP. In accordance with Massachusetts law, insurers may only charge MAIP policyholders the lower of the MAIP rate or the company s competitive voluntary market rate. CAR also sets rates for commercial automobile policies, including taxi/limousine/car service policies, reinsured through the CAR residual market pool. All commercial automobile business and taxi/limousine/car service business that is not written in the voluntary market in Massachusetts is apportioned to one of the servicing carriers that handles business on behalf of CAR. Every Massachusetts commercial automobile insurer must bear a portion of the losses of the total commercial reinsurance pool that is serviced by the approved servicing carriers. We are one of four servicing carriers in CAR s Commercial Automobile Program. Bulk Policy Transfers and New Voluntary Agents. From time to time, we receive proposals from an existing voluntary agent to transfer a portfolio of the agent s business from another insurer to us. Our underwriters model the 
 7 

Table of Contents 
 profitability of these portfolios before we accept these transfers. We generally require any new voluntary agent to commit to transfer a portfolio to us consisting of at least 300 policies. Policy Processing. Our underwriting department assists in processing policy applications, endorsements, renewals and cancellations. Our proprietary software applications, Safety Express and Safety Commercial Express, provide our agents with new business and endorsement entry, real-time policy issuance, immediate printing of declarations pages in agents offices, policy downloads to most major agency management systems and data imports from Boston Software s SinglePoint (Massachusetts) and Vertafore s PL Rater (Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine) for personal lines. Rate Pursuit . We aggressively monitor all insurance transactions to make sure we receive the correct premium for the risk insured. We accomplish this by verifying pricing criteria. For automobile policies, we verify proper classification of drivers, the make, model, and age of insured vehicles, and the availability of discounts. We also verify that operators are properly listed and classified, assignment of operators to vehicles, and vehicle garaging. In our homeowners and dwelling fire lines, we use third party software to evaluate property characteristics and we conduct property inspections. We have a premium audit program in our business owner program, as well as other loss control reviews for additional commercial lines of business. Product Management . The Product Management department is responsible for the overall review and updating of our products. The department maintains an annual schedule where each line of business is reviewed and benchmarked against our major competitors. Product offerings, discounts, rate levels and underwriting guidelines are reviewed and updates are performed as required. The department is also responsible for updating producer materials such as rate and rule manuals, underwriting guidelines, and promotional materials. In conjunction with the underwriting operations area, the department works with third party vendors that assist with risk information, data, and rate pursuit for in-force policies. The department also provides product training and general marketplace education for the organization. Legal and Regulatory Compliance . The Legal and Regulatory Compliance department provides legal and compliance support to all business units within the Company. The department serves as the primary liaison with regulators, government, and industry trade associations. The department also provides legal support to all areas of the company, including general corporate matters and vendor contracting. The department monitors legal and regulatory changes affecting the enterprise and provides guidance on how to comply with those changes. The department additionally reviews business unit operations to identify and address compliance vulnerabilities. Business Intelligence . The Business Intelligence department uses Safety s data assets to support decision-making in areas including underwriting, pricing, claims, reserving, reinsurance and assessing catastrophe risks. Data analytics are used to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks, and are leveraged to improve Company business performance and customer satisfaction. Customer Engagement. The Customer Engagement department provides professional customer service to our agents and insureds by continuously identifying new ways to enhance the ease of doing business with us and by looking for new ways to personalize our services for each customer. Technology The focuses of our information technology IT efforts are: to support the strategic goals, objectives and business needs of the Company by aligning our IT annual goals with those of the business assuring that IT resources are being utilized efficiently; to constantly re-engineer internal processes to allow more efficient operations, resulting in lower operating costs; to continuously improve the customer experience making it easier for independent agents and policyholders to transact business with us;

 to enable agents to efficiently provide their clients with a high level of service; and to maintain and support a secure computing environment. 
 We believe that our technology initiatives have increased revenue and decreased costs while at the same time improving the customer experience for our employees, agents, and policyholders. In 2021, we introduced our Safety Commercial Express commercial auto quoting and policy issuance system in Massachusetts for new business. During 2022, this system was updated to allow for agent processing of endorsements. We are continuously investing in new technologies including areas such as robotic process automation, artificial intelligence, and automated testing to improve company efficiency. Innovation Lab. Since 2018 we have had an Innovation Lab to foster a culture of innovative thinking, monitor the InsureTech landscape and provide Safety, our independent agents, and policyholders with the tools and processes necessary to continuously improve the customer experience and remain competitive in both the current and future insurance marketplace. During 2022, the Innovation Lab did substantial research, performed multiple proof of concepts, initiated pilot projects, participated in industry sponsored InsureTech events and presented fully functional technologies to the business for their use. In 2022, the Innovation Lab partnered with Safety s Commercial Underwriting department to introduce a no code low code product into our technology toolset which was used to develop an underwriting workbench. A proof of concept was also developed in partnership with our Service Center to explore the development of a Customer System of Record application. The Innovation Lab also partnered with the Claims department to select an outbound electronic claims payment system which we will look to implement in 2023. Internal Applications Our employees access our proprietary and vendor supplied applications through our secure corporate intranet. Our intranet applications streamline internal processes and improve overall operational efficiencies and customer experience in areas including: Claims. A vendor supplied claims system provides the claims department with a workload management application that allows our claims and subrogation adjusters to better manage the claims process. Subrogation refers to the process by which we are reimbursed by other insurers for claims costs we incur due to the fault of their insureds. The use of this application has reduced the time it takes for us to respond to and settle claims, which we believe helps reduce the total amount of our claims expense while also providing a better customer experience for the policyholder and claimant. The automated adjuster assignment system categorizes our new claims by severity and assigns them to the appropriate adjuster responsible for investigation. Once assigned, the integrated workload management tools facilitate the work of promptly assigning appraisers, investigating liability, issuing payments, and receiving subrogation receipts. Billing. A vendor supplied billing systems, integrated with the systems of our print and lock-box vendors, expedite the processing and collection of premium receipts and finance charges from agents and policyholders. This billing system also allows for policyholder automatic payments (AutoPay) as well as electronic bill (eBill). We believe the sophistication of our direct bill systems help us to limit our bad debt expense. Our bad debt expense as a percentage of direct written premiums was 0.1 in 2022 and 2021. External Applications Our agent technology offerings are centralized within our agency portal and feature PowerDesk, Safety Express and Safety Commercial Express. PowerDesk is a web-based application that allows for billing inquiry, agent payments on behalf of their policyholders, policy inquiry and claims inquiry. Safety Express and Safety Commercial Express provide agents with new business and endorsement entry, real-time policy issuance for personal lines, immediate printing of declarations pages in agents offices, policy downloads to most major agency management systems and data imports from Boston Software s SinglePoint, Vertafore s PL Rater, EZLynx and TurboRater. In addition, we provide our

Table of Contents 
 agents with commission and claims download for all lines of business, Transformation Station and Transact Now Inquires, e-Claims online claims reporting, e-View daily transaction reports and e-Docs online electronic document file cabinet. We also provide eBill, online bill pay (including credit and debit cards), online AutoPay registration, online declarations pages, billing inquiry, claims inquiry, auto and homeowners claims first notice of loss, online auto insurance cards, and bill pay reminder alerts to our agents policyholders through our public website, SafetyInsurance.com. Additionally, we provide policyholders with mobile technology through our Safety Mobile App for iPhone and Android devices. Safety Mobile provides consumers with access to their agent information, bill pay capabilities, the ability to report an automobile or homeowners claim and access to their insurance card, among other features. Claims On casualty claims we utilize stringent claims settlement procedures, which include guidelines that establish settlement ranges for soft tissue injuries, which constituted approximately 58 of our bodily injury claims in 2022. If we are unable to settle these claims within our pricing guidelines, we explore other cost-effective options including alternative dispute resolutions and/or litigation. We believe that these procedures result in providing our adjusting staff with a uniform approach to negotiation. We believe an important component of handling claims efficiently is prompt investigation and settlement. We find that faster claims settlements often result in less expensive claims settlements. Our E-Claim reporting system is an online product that reduces the time it takes for agents to notify our adjusters about claims, thereby enabling us to contact third-party claimants and other witnesses quickly. Our insureds can report claims directly by phone, web, or mobile application. In addition, we utilize an after-hours reporting vendor to ensure that new claims can be reported 24 hours per day and 365 days per year. We believe that early notification results in our adjusters conducting prompt investigations of claims and compiling more accurate information about those claims. Our modern claims software provides our staff with efficient workplan management tools to assist our adjusters in handling claims quickly while providing high levels of customer service. We believe the structure of our claims department allows us to respond quickly to claimants. The department is organized into distinct claim units that contain loss costs on injury claims. Field adjusters are located geographically for prompt response to claims, with our litigation unit focused on managing loss costs and litigation expenses for serious injury claims. Additionally, we utilize a special investigation unit to investigate potential fraud in connection with claims presented. In cases where adjusters suspect fraud in connection with a claim, we deploy this special unit to conduct investigations. We deny payment in cases in which we have succeeded in accumulating sufficient evidence of fraud. Our auto physical damage claims units handle physical damage claims arising in our private passenger and commercial automobile lines. Process automation has streamlined our claims function and in combination with established policy and procedures newly reported claims are handled in a proactive manner to ensure that coverages are verified, damages are appraised and claim payments are issued in a timely and efficient manner. This ensures the highest level of customer service to our insureds while reducing claim cycle times and mitigating claim handling expenses. We continue to vet and implement new methods of appraisal for vehicle damage, including vehicle photo only appraisals within the regulatory established guidelines. Once we receive this information, an automated system redirects the claim to the appropriate internal adjuster responsible for investigating the claim to determine liability. Upon determination of liability, the system automatically begins the process of seeking a subrogation recovery from another insurer, if liable. We believe this process results in a shorter time period from when the claimant first contacts the agent to when the 
 10 

Table of Contents 
 claimant receives a claim payment, while enabling our agents to build credibility with their clients by responding to claims in a timely and efficient manner. Our property claims division oversees physical damage claims arising in our homeowners and other than auto insurance lines. Property Field Adjusters are located remotely across our service areas to handle larger more complex property losses. Our modern claims software system and applications enables more efficient handling of the claim process and customer engagement from first notice of loss through settlement and potential subrogation. We also utilize house counsel on subrogation recoveries to reduce collection expenses and maximize damage recoveries. Reserves Significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to the insurer and the insurer s payment of that loss. To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses, insurers establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported losses and the expenses associated with investigating and paying the losses, or loss adjustment expenses. Every quarter, we review and establish our reserves. Regulations promulgated by the Commissioner require us to annually obtain a certification from either a qualified actuary or an approved loss reserve specialist, who may be one of our employees, that our loss and loss adjustment expenses reserves are reasonable. When a claim is reported, claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment. The amount of the reserve is primarily based upon an evaluation of the type of claim involved, the circumstances surrounding each claim and the policy provisions relating to the loss. The estimate reflects informed judgment of such personnel based on general insurance reserving practices and on the experience and knowledge of the claims person. During the loss adjustment period, these estimates are revised as deemed necessary by our claims department based on subsequent developments and periodic reviews of the cases. In accordance with industry practice, we also maintain reserves for estimated losses incurred but not yet reported. Incurred but not yet reported reserves are determined in accordance with commonly accepted actuarial reserving techniques on the basis of our historical information and experience. We make adjustments to incurred but not yet reported reserves quarterly to take into account changes in the volume of business written, claims frequency and severity, our mix of business, claims processing and other items that can be expected to affect our liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses over time. When reviewing reserves, we analyze historical data and estimate the impact of various loss development factors, such as our historical loss experience and that of the industry, legislative enactments, judicial decisions, legal developments in imposition of damages, and changes and trends in general economic conditions, including the effects of inflation. There is no precise method, however, for evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves, because the eventual development of reserves is affected by many factors. After taking into account all relevant factors, management believes that our provision for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at December 31, 2022 is adequate to cover the ultimate cost of losses and claims incurred as of that date. Management determines its loss and loss adjustment expense LAE reserve estimates based upon the analysis of the Company s actuaries. Management has established a process for the Company s actuaries to follow in establishing reasonable reserves. The process consists of meeting with our claims department, establishing ultimate incurred losses by using development models accepted by the actuarial community, and reviewing the analysis with management. The Company s estimate for loss and LAE reserves, net of the effect of ceded reinsurance, ranges from a low of 423,452 to a high of 481,902 as of December 31, 2022. The Company s net loss and LAE reserves, based on our actuaries best estimate, were set at 456,204 as of December 31, 2022. The ultimate liability may be greater or less than reserves carried at the balance sheet date. Establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process, and there can be no certainty that currently established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience. To the extent that reserves are inadequate and are strengthened, the amount of such increase is treated as a charge to earnings in the period that the deficiency is recognized. To the extent that reserves are redundant and are released, the amount of the release is a credit to earnings in the period the redundancy is recognized. We do not discount any of our reserves.

The top line of the table shows the reserves at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years. This represents the estimated amounts of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims arising in all years that were unpaid at the balance sheet date, including losses that had been incurred but not yet reported to us. The upper portion of the table shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of each successive year with respect to those claims. The lower portion of the table shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year, including cumulative payments made since the end of the respective year. The estimate changes as more information becomes known about the payments, frequency and severity of claims for individual years. Favorable loss development, shown as a cumulative redundancy in the table, exists when the original reserve estimate is greater than the re-estimated reserves at December 31, 2022.

Thus, if the 2022 estimate for a previously incurred loss was 150 and the loss was reserved at 100 in 2018, the 50 deficiency (later estimate minus original estimate) would be included in the cumulative (redundancy) deficiency in each of the years 2018-2021 shown in the table. It should further be noted that the table does not present accident or policy year development data. In addition, conditions and trends that have affected the development of liability in the past may not necessarily recur in the future. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies from the table. The table shows that we have substantially benefited in the current and prior years from releasing redundant reserves. In the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 we decreased loss reserves related to prior years by 57,279, 53,673 and 54,844, respectively. Reserves and development are discussed further in Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Executive Summary and Overview . As a result of our focus on core business lines since our founding in 1979, we believe we have no specific exposure to asbestos or environmental pollution liabilities. Reinsurance Reinsurance involves an insurance company transferring (ceding) a portion of its exposure on insurance underwritten by it to another insurer (reinsurer). The reinsurer assumes a portion of the exposure in return for a share of the premium. Reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurance company from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies, but it does make the reinsurer liable to the company for the reinsured portion of any loss realized.

 We reinsure with other insurance companies a portion of our potential liability under the policies we have underwritten, thereby protecting us against an unexpectedly large loss or a catastrophic occurrence that could produce large losses, primarily in our homeowners line of business. We are selective in choosing our reinsurers, seeking only those companies that we consider to be financially stable and adequately capitalized. In an effort to minimize exposure to the insolvency of a reinsurer, we continually evaluate and review the financial condition of our reinsurers. Most of our reinsurers have an A.M. Best rating of A+ (Superior) or A (Excellent). We maintain reinsurance coverage to help lessen the effect of losses from catastrophic events, maintaining coverage that during 2022 protected us in the event of a 135-year storm (that is, a storm of a severity expected to occur once in a 135-year period). We use various software products to measure our exposure to catastrophe losses and the probable maximum loss to us for catastrophe losses such as hurricanes. The models include estimates for our share of the catastrophe losses generated in the residual market for property insurance by the Massachusetts Property Insurance Underwriting Association FAIR Plan ). In 2022, we purchased three layers of excess catastrophe reinsurance providing 590,000 of coverage for property losses in excess of 75,000 up to a maximum of 665,000. Our reinsurers co-participation is 80.0 of 75,000 for the 1st layer, 80.0 of 250,000 for the 2nd layer, and 80.0 of 265,000 for the 3rd layer. For 2023, we have purchased three layers of excess catastrophe reinsurance providing 590,000 of coverage for property losses in excess of 75,000 up to a maximum of 665,000. Our reinsurers co-participation is 75.0 of 75,000 for the 1st layer, 75.0 of 250,000 for the 2nd layer and 75.0 of 265,000 for the 3rd layer. We also have casualty excess of loss reinsurance for large casualty losses occurring in our automobile, homeowners, dwelling fire, and business owner lines of business in excess of 2,000 up to a maximum of 10,000. We have property excess of loss reinsurance coverage for large property losses, with coverage in excess of 2,500 up to a maximum of 20,000, for our homeowners, and business owners. In addition, we have liability excess of loss reinsurance for umbrella large losses in excess of 1,000 up to a maximum of 10,000. We also have various reinsurance agreements with Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company, of which the primary contract is a quota share agreement under which we cede 100 of the premiums and losses for the equipment breakdown coverage under our business owner policies and commercial package policies. Our reinsurance program excludes coverage for acts of terrorism. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 was signed into law on December 20, 2019 which extended the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act TRIA through the year 2027. The intent of this legislation is to provide federal assistance to the insurance industry for the needs of commercial insurance policyholders with the potential exposure for losses due to acts of terrorism. TRIA provides reinsurance for certified acts of terrorism. In addition to the above mentioned reinsurance programs and as described in more detail above under The Massachusetts Property and Casualty Insurance Market, we are a participant in CAR, a state-established body that, in part, runs the residual market reinsurance programs for commercial automobile insurance in Massachusetts under which premiums, expenses, losses and loss adjustment expenses on ceded business are shared by all insurers writing automobile insurance in Massachusetts. We also participate in the FAIR Plan in which premiums, expenses, losses and loss adjustment expenses on homeowners business that cannot be placed in the voluntary market are shared by all insurers writing homeowners insurance in Massachusetts. On July 1, 2022, the FAIR Plan purchased 1,800,000 of catastrophe reinsurance for property losses with retention of 100,000. At December 31, 2022, we also had 115,058 due from CAR comprising of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, unearned premiums and reinsurance recoverables. On March 10, 2005, our Board of Directors (the Board adopted a resolution that prohibits Safety from purchasing finite reinsurance (reinsurance that transfers only a relatively finite or limited amount of risk to the reinsurer) without approval by the Board. To date, the Company has never purchased a finite reinsurance contract.

Table of Contents 
 Competition The property and casualty insurance business is highly competitive and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. We compete with both large national writers and smaller regional companies. Our competitors include companies which, like us, serve the independent agency market, as well as companies which sell insurance directly to customers. Direct writers may have certain competitive advantages over agency writers, including increased name recognition, loyalty of the customer base to the insurer rather than to an independent agency, and potentially, lower cost structures. A material reduction in the amount of business independent agents sell would adversely affect us. Further, we and others compete on the basis of the commissions and other cash and non-cash incentives provided to agents. Although, historically, a number of national insurers that are much larger than we are have chosen not to compete in a material way in the Massachusetts private passenger automobile market, since 2008, several new companies have entered the market. These companies include some that would be able to sustain significant losses in order to acquire market share, as well as others which use distribution methods that compete with the independent agent channel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against these companies in the future. Our principal competitors within the Massachusetts private passenger automobile insurance market are MAPFRE SA, Government Employees Insurance Company, Arbella Mutual Insurance Company and Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, which held 20.9 , 16.2 , 7.8 and 7.7 market shares based on premiums, respectively, in 2022 according to CAR. We are the second largest writer of commercial automobile insurance in Massachusetts with a market share of 12.6 in 2022. Other principal competitors in the Massachusetts commercial automobile insurance market are MAPFRE SA, Arbella Mutual Insurance Company and Progressive Casualty Insurance Company, which held 13.8 , 10.6 and 8.8 market shares based on premium, respectively, according to CAR. This includes our share of residual market business as one of four servicing carriers in CAR s Commercial Automobile Program. We are the third largest writer of homeowners insurance business in Massachusetts, with a market share of 6.5 in 2021. Our principal competitors within the Massachusetts homeowners insurance market are MAPFRE SA, Liberty Mutual and The Andover Companies, which held 12.2 , 9.2 and 6.2 market shares respectively in 2021 (according to S P Global Market Intelligence). Human Capital At December 31, 2022, we employed 538 employees who all work in the New England region. The management team establishes hiring and compensation practices for our Company. The Board is periodically updated on key employee engagement and employee relations measures. In addition, the Board s Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing performance and approving compensation paid to senior leaders. Our Human Resources team, led by our Chief Financial Officer, supports the Compensation Committee in the execution of its responsibilities.

 Investments Investment income is an important source of revenue for us and the return on our investment portfolio has a material effect on our net earnings. Our investment objective is to focus on maximizing total returns while investing conservatively. We maintain a high-quality investment portfolio consistent with our established investment policy. As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio of fixed maturity investments was comprised principally of investment grade corporate fixed maturity securities, U.S. government and agency securities, and asset-backed securities. The portion of our non-investment grade portfolio of fixed maturity investments is primarily comprised of variable rate secured and senior bank loans and high yield bonds. According to our investment guidelines, no more than 2.0 of our portfolio may be invested in the securities of any one issuer (excluding U.S. government-backed securities). In addition, no more than 0.5 of our portfolio may be invested in securities of any one issuer rated Baa, or the lowest investment grade assigned by Moody s. Of the less than 15.0 of our portfolio invested in senior bank loans and high yield bonds at December 31, 2022, no more than 5.0 may be invested in the securities of any one issuer, no more than 10.0 may be invested in any issuers total outstanding debt issue, and a maximum of 10.0 may be invested in securities unrated or rated B- or below by Moody s. We continually monitor the mix of taxable and tax-exempt securities in an attempt to maximize our total after-tax return. We utilize the services of third-party investment managers. We believe that the incorporation of material, non-financial factors into investment selection and risk management has the potential to enhance long-term investment returns. We incorporate Environmental, Social Governance ESG factors managed for us by third-party investment managers. We measure our exposure to ESG risks at both individual asset classes and total portfolio levels. The following table reflects the composition of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

(3) Other invested assets are accounted for under the equity method which approximates fair value.

Table of Contents 
 The principal risks inherent in holding mortgage-backed securities and other pass-through securities are prepayment and extension risks, which affect the timing of when cash flows will be received. When interest rates decline, mortgages underlying mortgage-backed securities tend to be prepaid more rapidly than anticipated, causing early repayments. When interest rates rise, the underlying mortgages tend to be prepaid at a slower rate than anticipated, causing the principal repayments to be extended. Although early prepayments may result in acceleration of income from recognition of any unamortized discount, the proceeds could be reinvested at a lower current yield, resulting in a net reduction of future investment income. In addition, in the current market environment, such investments can also contain liquidity risks. The Company invests in bank loans which are primarily investments in senior secured floating rate loans that banks have made to corporations. The loans are generally priced at an interest rate spread over the floating rate feature; this asset class provides protection against rising interest rates. However, this asset class is subject to default risk since these investments are typically below investment grade. Equity risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in equity prices. Our exposure to changes in equity prices results from our holdings of common stock, preferred stock, mutual funds and interests in mutual funds held to fund the executive deferred compensation plan. We continuously evaluate market conditions and we expect in the future to purchase additional equity securities. We principally manage equity price risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation techniques. The following table reflects our investment results for each of the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

 Ratings are generally assigned upon the issuance of the securities and are subject to revision on the basis of ongoing evaluations. Ratings in the table are as of the date indicated. The Securities Valuation Office of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the SVO evaluates all public and private bonds purchased as investments by insurance companies. The SVO assigns one of six investment categories to each security it reviews. Category 1 is the highest quality rating and Category 6 is the lowest. Categories 1 and 2 are the equivalent of investment grade debt as defined by rating agencies such as Standard Poor s Ratings Services and Moody s, while Categories 3-6 are the equivalent of below investment grade securities. SVO ratings are reviewed at least annually. At December 31, 2022, 65.5 of our available for sale fixed maturity investments were rated Category 1 and 18.3 were rated Category 2, the two highest ratings assigned by the SVO. The following table indicates the composition of our fixed income security portfolio (at carrying value) by time to maturity as of December 31, 2022.

 (1) Actual maturities of asset-backed securities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Prepayment rates are influenced by a number of factors that cannot be predicted with certainty, including: the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages or other collateral to changes in interest rates; a variety of economic, geographic and other factors; and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structures. Ratings A.M. Best, which rates insurance companies based on factors of concern to policyholders, currently assigns the Company an A (Excellent) rating. Our A rating was reaffirmed by A.M. Best on May 26, 2022. Such rating is the third highest rating of 13 ratings that A.M. Best assigns to solvent insurance companies, which currently range from A++ (Superior) to D (Poor). Publications of A.M. Best indicate that the A rating is assigned to those companies that in A.M. Best s opinion have an excellent ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders over a long period of time. In evaluating a company s financial and operating performance, A.M. Best reviews the Company s profitability, leverage and liquidity, as well as its book of business, the adequacy and soundness of its reinsurance, the quality and estimated fair value of its assets, the adequacy of its loss reserves, the adequacy of its surplus, its capital structure, the experience and competence of its management and its market presence. A.M. Best s ratings reflect its opinion of an insurance company s financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and are not evaluations directed to purchasers of an insurance company s securities. In assigning the Company s rating, A.M. Best recognized its solid risk-adjusted capitalization, conservative operating strategy, and long-standing agency relationships. A.M. Best also noted among our positive attributes our favorable investment leverage, our disciplined underwriting approach, and our expertise in the closely managed Massachusetts automobile insurance market. A.M. Best cited other factors that partially offset these positive attributes, including our concentration of business in the Massachusetts private passenger automobile market which exposes our business to regulatory actions. Supervision and Regulation Introduction. Our principal operations are conducted through the Insurance Subsidiaries which are subject to comprehensive regulation by state insurance departments, primarily through our domestic regulator, the Division, of 
 19 

Table of Contents 
 which the Commissioner is the senior official. The Commissioner is appointed by the Governor. We are subject to the authority of the Commissioner in many areas of our business under Massachusetts law, including: our licenses to transact insurance; the rates and policy forms we may use; our financial condition including the adequacy of our reserves and provisions for unearned premium; the solvency standards that we must maintain; the type and size of investments we may make; the prescribed or permitted statutory accounting practices we must use; and the nature of the transactions we may engage in with our affiliates. 
 In addition, the Commissioner periodically conducts financial and market conduct examinations of all licensees domiciled in Massachusetts. Our most recent financial condition examination was for the five-year period ending December 31, 2018. The Division had no material findings as a result of this examination. We are also required to be licensed by the insurance department in each state in which we do business, as well as to comply with the various laws and regulations of those jurisdictions, including those governing our use of rates and policy forms in those states. Insurance Holding Company Regulation. Our principal operating subsidiaries are insurance companies, and therefore we are subject to certain laws in Massachusetts regulating insurance holding company systems. These laws require that we file a registration statement with the Commissioner that discloses the identity, financial condition, capital structure and ownership of each entity within our corporate structure and any transactions among the members of our holding company system. In some instances, we must provide prior notice to the Commissioner for material transactions between our insurance company subsidiaries and other affiliates in our holding company system. These holding company statutes also require, among other things, prior approval of the payment of extraordinary dividends or distributions and any acquisition of a domestic insurer and that we file an annual Enterprise Risk Management report with the Commissioner. Insurance Regulation Concerning Dividends. We rely on dividends from the Insurance Subsidiaries for our cash requirements. The insurance holding company law of Massachusetts requires notice to the Commissioner of any dividend to the shareholders of an insurance company. The Insurance Subsidiaries may not make an extraordinary dividend until thirty days after the Commissioner has received notice of the intended dividend and has not objected in such time. As historically administered by the Commissioner, this provision requires the prior approval by the Commissioner of an extraordinary dividend. An extraordinary dividend is defined as any dividend or distribution that, together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months exceeds the greater of 10.0 of the insurer s surplus as of the preceding December 31, or the insurer s net income for the twelve-month period ending the preceding December 31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. Under Massachusetts law, an insurer may pay cash dividends only from its unassigned funds, also known as its earned surplus, and the insurer s remaining surplus must be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs. At December 31, 2022, the statutory surplus of Safety Insurance was 782,200 and its net income for 2022 was 66,197. A maximum of 78,220 will be available during 2022 for such dividends without prior approval of the Commissioner. Acquisition of Control of a Massachusetts Domiciled Insurance Company. Massachusetts law requires advance approval by the Commissioner of any change in control of an insurance company that is domiciled in Massachusetts. That law presumes that control exists where any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds the power to vote or holds proxies representing 10.0 or more of our outstanding voting stock. Even persons who do not acquire beneficial ownership of more than 10.0 of the outstanding shares of our common stock may be deemed to have acquired control if the Commissioner determines that control exists in fact. Any purchaser of shares of common stock representing 10.0 or more of the voting power of our capital stock will be presumed to have acquired control of the Insurance Subsidiaries 
 20 

Table of Contents 
 unless, following application by that purchaser the Commissioner determines that the acquisition does not constitute a change of control or is otherwise not subject to regulatory review. These requirements may deter, delay or prevent transactions affecting the control of or the ownership of our common stock, including transactions that could be advantageous to our stockholders. Protection Against Insurer Insolvency. Massachusetts law requires that insurers licensed to do business in Massachusetts participate in the Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund Insolvency Fund ). The Insolvency Fund must pay any claim up to 300 of a policyholder of an insolvent insurer if the claim existed prior to the declaration of insolvency or arose within sixty days after the declaration of insolvency. Members of the Insolvency Fund are assessed the amount the Insolvency Fund deems necessary to pay its obligations and expenses in connection with handling covered claims. Subject to certain exceptions, assessments are made in the proportion that each member s net written premiums for the prior calendar year for all property and casualty lines bore to the corresponding net written premiums for Insolvency Fund members for the same period. As a matter of Massachusetts law, insurance rates and premiums include amounts to recoup any amounts paid by insurers for the costs of the Insolvency Fund. By statute, no insurer in Massachusetts may be assessed in any year an amount greater than two percent of that insurer s direct written premium for the calendar year prior to the assessment. We account for allocations from the Insolvency Fund as underwriting expenses. CAR also assesses its members as a result of insurer insolvencies. Because CAR is not able to recover an insolvent company s share of the net CAR losses from the Insolvency Fund, CAR must increase each of its member s shares of the deficit in order to compensate for the insolvent carrier s inability to pay its deficit assessment. It is anticipated that there will be future assessments from time to time relating to various insolvencies. The Insurance Regulatory Information System. The Insurance Regulatory Information System IRIS was developed to help state insurance regulators identify companies that may require special financial attention. IRIS consists of a statistical phase and an analytical phase whereby financial examiners review annual statements and financial ratios. The statistical phase consists of 13 key financial ratios based on year-end data that are generated annually from the database of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC ). Each ratio has an established usual range of results. These ratios assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandate to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies. A ratio result falling outside the usual range of IRIS ratios is not considered a failing result; rather, unusual values are viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. Furthermore, in some years, it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside the usual ranges. Generally, an insurance company will become subject to regulatory scrutiny if it falls outside the usual ranges of four or more of the ratios. In 2022, 2021, and 2020 all our ratios for all our Insurance Subsidiaries were within the normal range. Risk-Based Capital Requirements. The NAIC has adopted a formula and model law to implement risk-based capital requirements for most property and casualty insurance companies, which are designed to determine minimum capital requirements and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policyholder obligations. The risk-based capital formula for property and casualty insurance companies measures three major areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers: underwriting, which encompasses the risk of adverse loss developments and inadequate pricing; declines in asset values arising from market and/or credit risk; and off-balance sheet risk arising from adverse experience from non-controlled assets, guarantees for affiliates or other contingent liabilities and reserve and premium growth. Under Massachusetts law, insurers having less total adjusted capital than that required by the risk-based capital calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy. The risk-based capital law provides for four levels of regulatory action. The extent of regulatory intervention and action increases as the level of total adjusted capital to risk-based capital falls. The first level, the company action 
 21 

Table of Contents 
 level, as defined by the NAIC, requires an insurer to submit a plan of corrective actions to the Commissioner if total adjusted capital falls below 200 of the risk-based capital amount. The regulatory action level, as defined by the NAIC requires an insurer to submit a plan containing corrective actions and requires the Commissioner to perform an examination or other analysis and issue a corrective order if total adjusted capital falls below 150.0 of the risk-based capital amount. The authorized control level, as defined by the NAIC, authorizes the Commissioner to take whatever regulatory actions he or she considers necessary to protect the best interest of the policyholders and creditors of the insurer which may include the actions necessary to cause the insurer to be placed under regulatory control, i.e., rehabilitation or liquidation, if total adjusted capital falls below 100.0 of the risk-based capital amount. The fourth action level is the mandatory control level, as defined by the NAIC, which requires the Commissioner to place the insurer under regulatory control if total adjusted capital falls below 70.0 of the risk-based capital amount. The formulas have not been designed to differentiate among adequately capitalized companies that operate with higher levels of capital. Therefore, it is inappropriate and ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to rank these companies. At December 31, 2022, our Insurance Subsidiaries had total adjusted capital in excess of amounts requiring company or regulatory action at any prescribed risk-based capital action level. Own Risk Solvency Assessment. On January 11, 2017, the Division adopted the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Own Risk Solvency Assessment ORSA Act requiring the Company to file its assessment on an annual basis. ORSA is an internal process undertaken by an insurer or insurance group to assess the adequacy of its risk management and current and prospective solvency positions under normal and severe stress scenarios. We have completed this filing for the 2021 period.

ITEM 1 A. RISK FACTORS An investment in our common stock involves a number of risks. Any of the risks described below could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition, and a corresponding decline in the market price of our common stock. We operate in a heavily regulated industry and are subject to regulations and laws in various jurisdictions: We are subject to comprehensive government regulation and our ability to earn profits may be restricted by these regulations. General Regulation. We are subject to regulation by the state insurance department of each state in which we do business. In each jurisdiction, we must comply with various laws and regulations, including those involving: approval or filing of premium rates and policy forms; limitation of the right to cancel or non-renew policies in some lines; requirements to participate in residual markets; licensing of insurers and agents; and regulation of the right to withdraw from markets or terminate involvement with agencies; 
 We also are subject to enhanced regulation by our domestic regulator, the Division, from which we must obtain prior approval for certain corporate actions. Among other things, we must comply with laws and regulations governing: transactions between an insurance company and any of its affiliates; the payment of dividends; the acquisition of an insurance company or of any company controlling an insurance company; solvency standards; minimum amounts of capital and surplus which must be maintained; limitations on types and amounts of investments; restrictions on the size of risks which may be insured by a single company; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; and reporting with respect to financial condition. 
 In addition, insurance department examiners from Massachusetts perform periodic financial and market conduct examinations of insurance companies. Such regulation is generally intended for the protection of policyholders rather than security holders. Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine require that all licensed property and casualty insurers bear a portion of the losses suffered by some insureds as a result of impaired or insolvent insurance companies by participating in each 
 25 

Table of Contents 
 state s insolvency fund. Members of the state s insolvency fund are assessed a proportionate share of the obligations and expenses of the fund in connection with an insolvent insurer. These assessments are made by the fund to cover the cost of paying eligible claims of policyholders of these insolvent insurers. Similarly, assessments are made by each state s commercial automobile insurance residual market mechanism to recover the shares of net losses that would have been assessed to the insolvent companies but for their insolvencies. In addition, Massachusetts has established an underwriting association in order to ensure that property insurance is available for owners of high risk property who are not able to obtain insurance from private insurers. The losses of this underwriting association, the Massachusetts Property Insurance Underwriting Association, are shared by all insurers that write property and casualty insurance in Massachusetts. We are assessed from time to time to pay these losses. The effect of these assessments could reduce our profitability in any given period and limit our ability to grow our business. Because we are unable to predict with certainty changes in the political, economic or regulatory environments of the states in which we operate in the future, there can be no assurance that existing insurance-related laws and regulations will not become more restrictive in the future or that new restrictive laws will not be enacted and, therefore, it is not possible to predict the potential effects of these laws and regulations on us. There are anti-takeover provisions contained in our organizational documents and in laws of the State of Delaware and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that could impede an attempt to replace or remove our management or prevent the sale of our company, which could diminish the value of our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and the laws of Delaware contain provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider in their best interests. For example, our organizational documents provide for a classified board of directors with staggered terms, prevent shareholders from taking action by written consent, prevent shareholders from calling a special meeting of shareholders, provide for supermajority voting requirements to amend our certificate of incorporation and certain provisions of our bylaws and provide for the filling of vacancies on our board of directors by the vote of a majority of the directors then in office. These provisions will render the removal of the incumbent board of directors or management more difficult. In addition, these provisions may prevent shareholders from receiving the benefit of any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. The Massachusetts insurance law prohibits any person from acquiring control of us, and thus indirect control of the Insurance Subsidiaries, without the prior approval of the Commissioner. That law presumes that control exists where any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds the power to vote or holds proxies representing 10.0 or more of our outstanding voting stock. Even persons who do not acquire beneficial ownership of more than 10.0 of the outstanding shares of our common stock may be deemed to have acquired such control if the Commissioner determines that such control exists in fact. Therefore, any person seeking to acquire a controlling interest in us would face regulatory obstacles which could delay, deter or prevent an acquisition that shareholders might consider in their best interests. Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the jurisdiction in which the Company is organized, may affect the ability of an interested stockholder to engage in certain business combinations including mergers, consolidations or acquisitions of additional shares, for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. An interested stockholder is defined to include persons owning directly or indirectly 15.0 or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation. Our private passenger automobile business is concentrated in in New England: With a concentration of private passenger automobile insurance, our business may be adversely affected by conditions in this industry. Approximately 52.0 of our direct written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2022 were generated from private passenger automobile insurance policies. As a result of our focus on that line of business, negative developments in the economic, competitive or regulatory conditions affecting the private passenger automobile insurance 
 26 

Table of Contents 
 industry could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, these developments would have a disproportionate effect on us, compared to insurers which conduct operations in multiple business lines. Because we write insurance principally in Massachusetts, our business may be adversely affected by conditions in Massachusetts, including the impact of additional competitors. Almost all of our direct written premiums are currently generated in Massachusetts. Our revenues and profitability are therefore subject to prevailing regulatory, economic, demographic, competitive and other conditions in Massachusetts. Changes in any of these conditions could make it more costly or difficult for us to conduct our business. The Massachusetts market has seen an increased level of competition, particularly in the private passenger automobile insurance line, due to prior changes in regulatory conditions. To date, we have not had a significant decrease in our private passenger automobile insurance business. However, further competition and adverse results could include loss of market share, decreased revenue, and/or increased costs. As writers of property insurance, our Insurance Subsidiaries are exposed to potential losses related to severe weather: We have exposure to claims related to severe weather conditions, which may result in an increase in claims frequency and severity. We are subject to claims arising out of severe weather conditions, such as rainstorms, snowstorms and icestorms, that may have a significant effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The incidence and severity of weather conditions are inherently unpredictable. There is generally an increase in claims frequency and severity under the private passenger automobile insurance we write when severe weather occurs because a higher incidence of vehicular accidents and other insured losses tend to occur as a result of severe weather conditions. In addition, we have exposure to an increase in claims frequency and severity under the homeowners and other property insurance we write because property damage may result from severe weather conditions. Because some of our insureds live near the Massachusetts coastline, we also have a potential exposure to losses from hurricanes and major coastal storms such as Nor easters. Although we purchase catastrophe reinsurance to limit our exposure to natural catastrophes, in the event of a major catastrophe resulting in property losses to us in excess of 665,000 our losses would exceed the limits of this reinsurance in addition to losses from our co-participation retention of a portion of the risk up to 665,000. Climate change and increasing climate change regulation may adversely impact our results of operations. There are concerns that the increase in weather-related catastrophes and other losses incurred by the industry in recent years may be indicative of changing weather patterns. This change in weather patterns could lead to higher overall losses and higher reinsurance costs. Changes in climate conditions may also cause our underlying modeling data to not adequately reflect frequency and severity, limiting our ability to effectively evaluate and manage risks of catastrophes and severe weather events. Among other impacts, this could result in not charging enough premiums or not obtaining timely state approvals for rate increases to cover the risks we insure. Climate change could also have an impact on issuers of securities in which we invest, resulting in realized and unrealized losses in future periods which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and/or financial position. We are also subject to complex and changing laws and regulations relating to climate change which are difficult to predict and quantify and may have an adverse impact on our business. Changes in regulations relating to climate change or our own management decisions implemented as a result of assessing the impact of climate change on our business may result in an increase in the cost of doing business.

 We are subject to economic and underwriting market conditions: The impact of inflation and supply chain delays may increase loss severity. Economic and market conditions outside of our control, such as inflation and supply chain issues, may adversely impact our underwriting profitability. We operate in the highly competitive property and casualty insurance industry: If we are not able to attract and retain independent agents, it could adversely affect our business. We market our insurance solely through independent agents. We must compete with other insurance carriers for the business of independent agents. Some of our competitors offer a larger variety of products, lower prices for insurance coverage or higher commissions. While we believe that the commissions and services we provide to our agents are competitive with other insurers, changes in commissions, services or products offered by our competitors could make it harder for us to attract and retain independent agents to sell our insurance products. Established competitors with greater resources may make it difficult for us to market our products effectively and offer our products at a profit. The property and casualty insurance business is highly competitive and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. We compete with both large national writers and smaller regional companies. Further, our competitors include other companies which, like us, serve the independent agency market, as well as companies which sell insurance directly to customers. Direct writers may have certain competitive advantages over agency writers, including increased name recognition, loyalty of the customer base to the insurer rather than to an independent agency and, potentially, lower cost structures. A material reduction in the amount of business independent agents sell would directly and negatively affect our profitability and our ability to compete with insurers that do not rely solely on the independent agency market to sell their products. Further, our Company and others compete on the basis of the commissions and other cash and non-cash incentives provided to agents. Although a number of national insurers that are much larger than we are do not currently compete in a material way in the Massachusetts personal auto market, if one or more of these companies decided to aggressively enter the market it could reduce our share of the Massachusetts market and thereby have a material adverse effect on us. These companies include some that would be able to sustain significant losses in order to acquire market share, as well as others which use distribution methods that compete with the independent agent channel. Progressive Corporation, GEICO and Allstate, large insurers that market directly to policyholders rather than through agents, along with other carriers have entered the Massachusetts private passenger automobile insurance market. We may enter new markets and there can be no assurance that our diversification strategy will be effective. Although we intend to concentrate on our core businesses in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine, we also may seek to take advantage of prudent opportunities to expand our core businesses into other states where we believe the independent agent distribution channel is strong. As a result of a number of factors, including the difficulties of finding appropriate expansion opportunities and the challenges of operating in an unfamiliar market, we may not be successful in this diversification. Additionally, in order to carry out any such strategy we would need to obtain the appropriate licenses from the insurance regulatory authority of any such state. The success of our business is subject to operational risks:

 We may not be able to successfully alleviate risk through reinsurance arrangements which could cause us to reduce our premiums written in certain lines or could result in losses. In order to reduce risk, to increase our underwriting capacity, and mitigate the volatility of losses on our financial condition and operations, we purchase reinsurance. The availability and the cost of reinsurance protection are subject to market conditions, which are outside of our control. As a result, we may not be able to successfully alleviate risk through these arrangements. For example, if reinsurance capacity for homeowner s risks were reduced as a result of terrorist attacks, climate change or other causes, we might seek to reduce the amount of homeowners business we write. As a result, the Company may not be able to successfully purchase reinsurance and transfer a portion of the Company s risk through reinsurance arrangements. In addition, we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurance because the ceding of risk to reinsurers does not relieve us of our liability to our policyholders. A significant reinsurer s insolvency or inability to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. As a holding company, Safety Insurance Group, Inc. is dependent on the results of operations of the Safety Insurance Company . Safety Insurance Group, Inc. is a company and a legal entity separate and distinct from Safety Insurance Company, our principal operating subsidiary. As a holding company without significant operations of its own, the principal sources of Safety Insurance Group, Inc. s funds are dividends and other distributions from Safety Insurance Company. Our rights to participate in any distribution of assets of Safety Insurance Company are subject to prior claims of policyholders, creditors and preferred shareholders, if any, of Safety Insurance Company (except to the extent that our rights, if any, as a creditor are recognized). Consequently, our ability to pay debts, expenses and cash dividends to our shareholders may be limited. The ability of Safety Insurance Company to pay dividends is subject to limits under Massachusetts insurance law. Further, the ability of Safety Insurance Group, Inc. to pay dividends, and our subsidiaries ability to incur indebtedness or to use the proceeds of equity offerings, will be subject to limits under our revolving credit facility. Our failure to maintain a commercially acceptable financial strength rating would significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy successfully. A.M. Best has currently assigned Safety Insurance an A (Excellent) rating. An A rating is A.M. Best s third highest rating, out of 13 possible rating classifications for solvent companies. An A rating is assigned to insurers that in A.M. Best s opinion have an excellent ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders. Moreover, an A rating is assigned to companies that have, on balance, excellent balance sheet strength, operating performance and business profile when compared to the standards established by A.M. Best. A.M. Best bases its ratings on factors that concern policyholders and not upon factors concerning investor protection. Such ratings are subject to change and are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities. An important factor in an insurer s ability to compete effectively is its A.M. Best rating. Our A.M. Best rating is lower than those of some of our competitors. Any future decrease in our rating could affect our competitive position. Our losses and loss adjustment expenses may exceed our reserves, which could significantly affect our business. The reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses that we have established are estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported claims and related expenses based on facts and circumstances known to us as of the time we established the reserves. Reserves are based on historical claims information, industry statistics and other factors. The establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process. If our reserves are inadequate and are strengthened, we would have to treat the amount of such increase as a charge to our earnings in the period that the deficiency is recognized. As a result of these factors, there can be no assurance that our ultimate liability will not materially exceed our reserves and have a negative effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Due to the inherent uncertainty of estimating reserves, it has been necessary, and may over time continue to be necessary, to revise estimated future liabilities as reflected in our reserves for claims and policy expenses. The historic 
 29 

Table of Contents 
 development of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses may not necessarily reflect future trends in the development of these amounts. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to extrapolate redundancies or deficiencies based on historical information. If we lose key personnel, our ability to implement our business strategy could be delayed or hindered. The loss of key personnel could prevent us from fully implementing our business strategy and could significantly and negatively affect our financial condition or results of operations. As we continue to grow, we will need to recruit and retain additional qualified management personnel, and our ability to do so will depend upon a number of factors, such as our results of operations and prospects and the level of competition then prevailing in the market for qualified personnel. Acquisitions may not produce the anticipated benefits and may result in unintended consequences, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses or achieve the expected synergies as a result of such acquisitions. The process of integrating an acquired business can be complex and costly and may create unforeseen operating difficulties that could result in the business performing differently than we expected, including through the loss of customers or in our failure to realize anticipated increased revenue growth or expense-related efficiencies. If our agency business does not perform well, we may be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. We test goodwill at least annually for impairment. Impairment testing is performed based upon estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates. The fair value of the reporting unit could decrease if new business, customer retention, profitability or other drivers of performance differ from expectations. If it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired, we must write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income (loss). These write downs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Future sales of shares of our common stock by our existing shareholders in the public market, or the possibility or perception of such future sales, could adversely affect the market price of our stock. Investors currently known to be the beneficial owners of greater than 5.0 of our outstanding common stock hold approximately 47.3 of the common stock of Safety Insurance Group, Inc. on a fully diluted basis. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales of shares by our existing shareholders, or the availability of shares for future sale, will have on the prevailing market price of our common stock from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing shareholders, or the possibility or perception that such sales could occur, could cause the prevailing market prices for our common stock to decrease. If such sales reduce the market price of our common stock, our ability to raise additional capital in the equity markets may be adversely affected. A proxy contest with an activist shareholder could cause us to incur significant costs, divert management s attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business Activist shareholders may engage in proxy solicitations, advance shareholder proposals or director nominations or otherwise attempt to affect changes or acquire control over us. Responding to these actions can be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our Board and management from the management of our operations and the pursuit of our business strategies, particularly if such activist shareholders advocate for actions that are not supported by other shareholders, our Board or management. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, damage to our reputation and may make it more difficult to attract and retain

 qualified directors, personnel and business partners. These actions could also cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility. We are subject to technology, cybersecurity and privacy risks: Our business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our systems and business functions, including our information technology, telecommunications and other business systems. Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not sufficiently address all contingencies. Our business is highly dependent upon our ability to execute, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions, such as processing new and renewal business, providing customer service, and processing and paying claims. A shut-down of or inability to access our facility, a power outage, or a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. If sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, systems failure or service denial could result in a deterioration in the level of service we provide to our agents and policyholders. We have established a business continuity plan in an effort to ensure the continuation of core business operations in the event that normal business operations could not be performed due to a catastrophic event. While we continue to test and assess our business continuity plan to ensure it meets the needs of our core business operations and addresses multiple business interruption events, there is no assurance that core business operations could be performed upon the occurrence of such an event, which may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. We outsource certain business and administrative functions to third parties and may do so increasingly in the future. If we fail to develop and implement our outsourcing strategies or our third-party providers fail to perform as anticipated, we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and a loss of business that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Our business could be materially and adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or the systems of one or more of our agents and vendors. Our highly automated and networked organization is subject to cyber-terrorism and a variety of other cyber-security threats. These threats come in a variety of forms, such as viruses and malicious software. Such threats can be difficult to prevent or detect, and if experienced, could interrupt or damage our operations, harm our reputation or have a material effect on our operations. Our technology and telecommunications systems are highly integrated and connected with other networks. Cyber-attacks involving these systems could be carried out remotely and from multiple sources and could interrupt, damage or otherwise adversely affect the operations of these critical systems. Cyber-attacks could result in the modification or theft of data, the distribution of false information or the denial of service to users. The risks of cyber-attacks could be exacerbated by geopolitical tensions, including hostile actions taken by nation-states and terrorist organizations. We obtain, utilize and maintain data concerning individuals and organizations with which we have a business relationship. Threats to data security can emerge from a variety of sources and change in rapid fashion, resulting in the ongoing need to expend resources to secure our data in accordance with customer expectations and statutory and regulatory requirements. Our businesses must comply with regulations to control the privacy of customer, employee and third-party data, and state, federal and international regulations regarding data privacy, are becoming increasingly more onerous. A misuse or mishandling of confidential or proprietary information could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm. We could be subject to liability if confidential customer information is misappropriated from our technology systems. Despite the implementation of security measures, these systems may be vulnerable to physical 
 31 

Table of Contents 
 break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. Any well-publicized compromise of security could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to our systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation. We rely on services and products provided by many vendors. In the event that one or more of our vendors fails to protect personal information of our customers, claimants or employees, we may incur operational impairments, or could be exposed to litigation, compliance costs or reputational damage. We maintain cyber-liability insurance coverage to offset certain potential losses, subject to policy limits, such as liability to others, costs of related crisis management, data extortion, applicable forensics and certain regulatory defense costs, fines and penalties. While, to date, we are not aware of having experienced a material breach of our cyber security systems, administrative, internal accounting and technical controls as well as other preventive actions may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, denial of service, cyber-attacks, business email compromises, ransomware or other security breaches to our systems or those of third parties with whom we do business. We believe that we have established and implemented appropriate security measures to provide reasonable assurance that our information technology systems are secure and appropriate controls and procedures to enable us to identify and respond to unauthorized access to such systems. While we have not experienced material cyber-incidents to date, the occurrence and effects of cyber-incidents may remain undetected for an extended period. We periodically engage third parties to evaluate and test the adequacy of our security measures, controls and procedures. Despite these security measures, controls and procedures, disruptions to and breaches of our information technology systems are possible. We invest in securities which are subject to market risk: Market fluctuations and changes in interest rates can have significant and negative effects on our investment portfolio. Our results of operations depend in part on the performance of our invested assets. As of December 31, 2022, based upon fair value measurement, 74.9 of our investment portfolio was invested in fixed maturity securities, 17.1 in equity securities and 8.0 in other invested assets. Certain risks are inherent in connection with debt securities including loss upon default and price volatility in reaction to changes in interest rates and general market factors. We have a significant investment portfolio and adverse capital market conditions, including but not limited to volatility and credit spread changes, will impact the liquidity and value of our investments, potentially resulting in higher realized or unrealized losses. Values of our investments can also be impacted by reductions in price transparency and changes in investor confidence and preferences, potentially resulting in higher realized or unrealized losses. If the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value, and the decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we will be required to write down the value of our investments, which could materially harm our results of operations or financial condition. ITEM 1 B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS As of the date of this report, the Company had no unresolved comments from the Commission staff regarding its periodic or current reports under the Exchange Act. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES We conduct most of our operations in approximately 72 thousand square feet of leased space at 20 Custom House Street in downtown Boston, Massachusetts. Our lease will expire on December 31, 2028 . This real estate space was remodeled in 2018 and included capital expenditures to update lighting as well as heating, ventilation and air condition systems with state of the art and environmentally focused technologies.

 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Our Insurance Subsidiaries are parties to a number of lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of their insurance business. We believe that the ultimate resolution of these lawsuits will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Safety Insurance had been named in a lawsuit alleging that the Company improperly denied coverage to commercial insureds for loss of business income resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the lawsuit, the Company accrued a reserve of 6,500 for legal defense costs included in loss and loss adjustment expense during the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, the claim against the Company was closed and the accrual of 6,500 was reversed. On October 19, 2021, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (the Court unanimously ruled that property and casualty insurers must compensate third-party claimants under property damage coverage, part 4 of the standard Massachusetts automobile insurance policy, 2008 edition (standard policy), for the inherent diminished value IDV that occurs when their vehicles are damaged in a crash. This ruling overturned a previous decision by the Massachusetts Superior Court, which found that a Massachusetts auto insurance policy did not provide property damage coverage for inherent diminished value damages for third-party claimants. The Court placed the burden of proof on the individual claimant by explicitly specifying that the claimant must establish that the vehicle has suffered IDV damages and also the amount of IDV damages at issue. The Court further ruled that an insurer s previous denial of coverage for such damages could not serve as the basis for a claim of unfair business practices. Based on the Court s rulings, at this time the Company does not expect any claims for IDV damages to be material, and therefore has not accrued for a specific loss contingency ITEM 4.

 PART II. ITEM 5. MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES As of February 21, 2023, there were 20 holders of record of the Company s common stock, par value 0.01 per share, and we estimate another 17,280 held in Street Name. The closing price of the Company s common stock on February 21, 2023 was 87.32 per share. The Company s common stock trades on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol SAFT. During 2022 and 2021, the Company s Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends to shareholders, which were paid and accrued in the amounts of 52,995 and 53,996, respectively. On February 22, 2023, the Company s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.90 per share to shareholders of record on March 1, 2023 payable on March 15, 2023. The Company plans to continue to declare and pay quarterly cash dividends in 2023, depending on the Company s financial position and the regularity of its cash flows. The Company relies on dividends from its Insurance Subsidiaries for a portion of its cash requirements. The payment by the Company of any cash dividends to the holders of common stock therefore depends on the receipt of dividend payments from its Insurance Subsidiaries. The payment of dividends by the Insurance Subsidiaries is subject to limitations imposed by Massachusetts law, as discussed in Item 1 Business, Supervision and Regulation, Insurance Regulation Concerning Dividends , and also in Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources. The information called for by Item 201 (d) of Regulation S-K regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans will be contained in the Company s Proxy Statement for its Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which the Company intends to file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission within 120 days after December 31, 2022 (the Company s fiscal year end), and such information is incorporated herein by reference. For information regarding our share repurchase program, refer to Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14, Share Repurchase Program, of this Form 10-K.

Executive Summary and Overview In this discussion, Safety refers to Safety Insurance Group, Inc. and our Company, we, us and our refer to Safety Insurance Group, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries consist of Safety Insurance Company Safety Insurance ), Safety Indemnity Insurance Company Safety Indemnity ), Safety Property and Casualty Insurance Company Safety P C ), Safety Northeast Insurance Company Safety Northeast ), Safety Northeast Insurance Agency, Inc. SNIA ), and Safety Management Corporation SMC ), which is SNIA s holding company. We are a leading provider of private passenger automobile (52.0 of our direct written premiums in 2022), commercial automobile, (17.4 of 2022 direct written premiums), and homeowners (25.3 of 2022 direct written premiums) insurance. In addition to these coverages, we offer a portfolio of other insurance products, including dwelling fire, umbrella and business owner policies (totaling 5.3 of 2022 direct written premiums). Operating exclusively in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine through our insurance company subsidiaries, Safety Insurance, Safety Indemnity, Safety P C, and Safety Northeast (together referred to as the Insurance Subsidiaries ), we have established strong relationships with independent insurance agents, who numbered 843 in 1,071 locations throughout these three states during 2022. We have used these relationships and our extensive knowledge of the market to become the fifth largest private passenger automobile carrier and the second largest commercial automobile carrier in Massachusetts, capturing an approximate 7.7 and 12.6 share, respectively, of the Massachusetts private passenger and commercial automobile markets in 2022, according to statistics compiled by the Commonwealth Automobile Reinsurers CAR based on automobile exposures. We are the third largest homeowners insurance carrier in Massachusetts, with a market share of 6.5 in 2021. A.M. Best, which rates insurance companies based on factors of concern to policyholders, currently assigns Safety Insurance an A (Excellent) rating. Our A rating was reaffirmed by A.M. Best on May 26, 2022. Our Insurance Subsidiaries began writing insurance in New Hampshire during 2008 and Maine in 2016. In November 2020, we formed a fourth insurance subsidiary, Safety Northeast, which became licensed to write insurance products in Massachusetts. The table below shows the amount of direct written premiums in each state during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.

Years Ended December 31, Direct Written Premiums 2022 2021 2020 Massachusetts 782,790 765,007 764,479 New Hampshire 36,519 34,261 32,334 Maine 4,009 2,871 1,899 Total 823,318 802,139 798,712 Recent Events On December 1, 2022, SNIA was established when the Company acquired the assets and operations of Northeast Metrowest Insurance Agency, Inc. Northeast / Metrowest ), an independent insurance agency, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, SMC. Since 1989, Northeast / Metrowest had provided personal and commercial insurance to properly protect its customers by determining the best coverage to suit their unique needs. Over time, Northeast / Metrowest had grown to include over 40 million in policy premiums. SNIA will operate as a stand-alone business operation, providing personal and commercial property and casualty insurance products to customers on behalf of the Insurance Subsidiaries and third-party insurance carriers. The Company had been named in a lawsuit alleging that the Company improperly denied coverage to commercial insureds for loss of business income resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our position is that no coverage existed for this peril. As a result of the lawsuit, the Company accrued a reserve of 6,500 for legal defense costs included in the loss and loss adjustment expenses during the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the claim against the Company was closed and the accrual of 6,500 was reversed. Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by 30,252, or 6.6 , to 491,979 from 461,727 for the comparable 2021 period. The increase in losses is due to a return of pre-pandemic frequency in our private passenger automobile line of business and current market conditions including inflation and supply chain delays. Loss, expense, and combined ratios calculated under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 were 68.4 , 32.3 , and 100.7 , respectively, compared to 62.7 , 33.7 , and 96.4 , respectively, for the comparable 2021 period. Loss, expense, and combined ratios calculated under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 64.9 , 32.3 , and 97.2 , respectively, compared to 59.6 , 33.4 , and 93.0 , respectively, for the comparable 2021 period. The 2022 decrease in the expense ratios in both periods is primarily driven by a decrease in contingent commission expense. We define a catastrophe as an event that produces pre-tax losses before reinsurance in excess of 1,000 and involves multiple first-party policyholders, or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset, per-event threshold of average claims in a specific area, occurring within a certain amount of time following the event. Catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds, winter storms, tornadoes, hailstorms, and hurricanes. The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be reliably predicted. Catastrophe losses incurred by the type of event are shown in the following table.

 The following rate changes have been filed and approved by the insurance regulators of Massachusetts and New Hampshire in 2022 and 2021. Our Massachusetts private passenger automobile rates include a 13 commission rate for agents. 

Line of Business Effective Date Rate Change Massachusetts Commercial Automobile May 1, 2022 3.1 Massachusetts Homeowner July 1, 2022 2.6 Massachusetts Private Passenger Automobile April 1, 2022 -2.3 Massachusetts Private Passenger Automobile December 1, 2022 3.5 New Hampshire Commercial Automobile September 1, 2022 5.8 New Hampshire Homeowners September 1, 2022 3.5 New Hampshire Private Passenger Automobile September 1, 2022 2.8 Statutory Accounting Principles Our results are reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), which differ from amounts reported in accordance with statutory accounting principles SAP as prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities, which in general reflect a liquidating, rather than going concern concept of accounting. Specifically, under GAAP: Policy acquisition costs such as commissions, premium taxes and other variable costs incurred which are directly related to the successful acquisition of a new or renewal insurance contract are capitalized and amortized on a pro rata basis over the period in which the related premiums are earned, rather than expensed as incurred, as required by SAP. Certain assets are included in the consolidated balance sheets whereas, under SAP, such assets are designated as nonadmitted assets, and charged directly against statutory surplus. These assets consist primarily of premium receivables that are outstanding over ninety days, federal deferred tax assets in excess of statutory limitations, furniture, equipment, leasehold improvements and prepaid expenses. Amounts related to ceded reinsurance are shown gross of ceded unearned premiums and reinsurance recoverables, rather than netted against unearned premium reserves and loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, respectively, as required by SAP. Fixed maturities securities, which are classified as available-for-sale, are reported at current fair values, rather than at amortized cost, or the lower of amortized cost or market, depending on the specific type of security, as required by SAP. The differing treatment of income and expense items results in a corresponding difference in federal income tax expense. Changes in deferred income taxes are reflected as an item of income tax benefit or expense, rather than recorded directly to surplus as regards policyholders, as required by SAP. Admittance testing may result in a charge to unassigned surplus for non-admitted portions of deferred tax assets. Under GAAP reporting, a valuation allowance may be recorded against the deferred tax asset and reflected as an expense. Insurance Ratios The property and casualty insurance industry uses the combined ratio as a measure of underwriting profitability. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio (losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percent of net earned premiums) plus the expense ratio (underwriting and other expenses as a percent of net earned premiums, calculated on a GAAP basis). The combined ratio reflects only underwriting results and does not include income from

 investments or finance and other service income. Underwriting profitability is subject to significant fluctuations due to competition, catastrophic events, weather, economic and social conditions, and other factors. Our GAAP insurance ratios are presented in the following table for the periods indicated. 

Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 GAAP ratios: Loss ratio 64.9 59.6 52.5 Expense ratio 32.3 33.4 34.6 Combined ratio 97.2 93.0 87.1 Share-Based Compensation On March 24, 2022, the Company s Board of Directors adopted the Amended and Restated Safety Insurance Group, Inc. 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Amended 2018 Plan ), which was subsequently approved by our shareholders at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Amended 2018 Plan increases the share pool limit by adding 350,000 common shares to the previously adopted Safety Insurance Group, Inc. 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The Amended 2018 Plan enables the grant of stock awards, performance shares, cash-based performance units, other stock-based awards, stock options, stock appreciation rights, and stock unit awards, each of which may be granted separately or in tandem with other awards. Eligibility to participate includes officers, directors, employees and other individuals who provide bona fide services to the Company. The Amended 2018 Plan supersedes the Company s 2002 Management Omnibus Incentive Plan the 2002 Incentive Plan ). The Amended 2018 Plan establishes a pool of 700,000 shares of common stock available for issuance to our employees and other eligible participants. The Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee intend to issue awards under the Amended 2018 Plan in the future. The maximum number of shares of common stock between both the 2018 Amended Plan and 2002 Incentive Plan with respect to which awards may be granted is 3,200,000. No further grants will be allowed under the 2002 Incentive Plan. At December 31, 2022, there were 444,216 shares available for future grant. Grants outstanding under the plans as of December 31, 2022, were comprised of 138,482 restricted shares. Grants made under the Incentive Plan during the years 2020 through 2022 were as follows.

 (3) The shares represent performance-based restricted shares award. Vesting of these shares is dependent upon the attainment of pre-established performance objectives, and any difference between shares granted and shares earned at the end of the performance period will be reported at the conclusion of the performance period. (4) The shares represent a true-up of previously awarded performance-based restricted share awards. The updated shares were calculated based on the attainment of pre-established performance objectives. Reinsurance We reinsure with other insurance companies a portion of our potential liability under the policies we have underwritten, thereby protecting us against an unexpectedly large loss or a catastrophic occurrence that could produce large losses, primarily in our homeowners line of business. We use various software products to measure our exposure to catastrophe losses and the probable maximum loss to us for catastrophe losses such as hurricanes. The models include estimates for our share of the catastrophe losses generated in the residual market for property insurance by the FAIR Plan. The reinsurance market has seen from the various software modelers, increases in the estimate of damage from hurricanes in the southern and northeast portions of the United States due to revised estimations of increased hurricane activity and increases in the estimation of demand surge in the periods following a significant event. We continue to manage and model our exposure and adjust our reinsurance programs as a result of the changes to the models. As of January 1, 2022, we purchased three layers of excess catastrophe reinsurance providing 590,000 of coverage for property losses in excess of 75,000 up to a maximum of 665,000. Our reinsurers co-participation is 80.0 of 75,000 for the 1st layer, 80.0 of 250,000 for the 2nd layer, and 80.0 of 265,000 for the 3rd layer. As a result of the changes to the models, our catastrophe reinsurance in 2022 protects us in the event of a 135-year storm (that is, a storm of a severity expected to occur once in a 135-year period). Most of our reinsurers have an A.M. Best rating of A+ (Superior) or A (Excellent). We are a participant in CAR, a state-established body that runs the residual market reinsurance programs for commercial automobile insurance in Massachusetts under which premiums, expenses, losses and loss adjustment expenses on ceded business are shared by all insurers writing commercial automobile insurance in Massachusetts. We also participate in the Massachusetts Property Insurance Underwriting Association FAIR Plan ), in which premiums, expenses, losses and loss adjustment expenses on homeowners business that cannot be placed in the voluntary market are shared by all insurers writing homeowners insurance in Massachusetts. The FAIR Plan buys reinsurance to reduce their exposure to catastrophe losses. On July 1, 2022, the FAIR Plan purchased 1,800,000 of catastrophe reinsurance for property losses with retention of 100,000. We also had 115,058 due from CAR comprising of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, unearned premiums and reinsurance recoverables. Non-GAAP Measures Management has included certain non-generally accepted accounting principles non-GAAP financial measures in presenting the Company s results. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures better explain the Company s results of operations and allow for a more complete understanding of the underlying trends in the Company s business. These measures should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our definitions of these items may not be comparable to the definitions used by other companies. Non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating income per diluted share consist of our GAAP net income adjusted by the net realized gains on investments, net impairment losses on investments, changes in net unrealized gains on equity securities, credit loss benefit (expense) and taxes related thereto. Net income and earnings per diluted share are the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating income per diluted share, respectively. A reconciliation of the GAAP financial measures to these non-GAAP measures is included in the financial highlights below.

Net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by 2,590, or 5.9 , to 46,725 from 44,135 for the comparable 2021 period. The increase is a result of increases in interest rates on our fixed maturity portfolio as compared to the prior year. Net effective annual yield on the investment portfolio was 3.2 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 3.0 for comparable 2021 period. Our duration was 3.8 years at December 31, 2022, compared to 3.6 years at December 31, 2021. Earnings from Partnership Investments.

The Company concluded that outside of the securities that were recognized as credit impaired, the unrealized losses recorded on the fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 resulted from fluctuations in market interest rates and other temporary market conditions as opposed to fundamental changes in the credit quality of the issuers of such securities. Based upon the analysis performed, the Company s decision to hold these securities, the Company s current level of liquidity and our history of positive operating cash flows, management believes it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell any of its securities before the anticipated recovery in the fair value to its amortized cost basis. Specific qualitative analysis was also performed for securities appearing on our Watch List, if any. Qualitative analysis considered such factors as the financial condition and the near term prospects of the issuer, whether the debtor is current on its contractually obligated interest and principal payments, changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency and the historical volatility of the fair value of the security.

 The majority of unrealized losses recorded on the investment portfolio at December 31, 2022 resulted from fluctuations in market interest rates and other temporary market conditions as opposed to fundamental changes in the credit quality of the issuers of such securities. Given our current level of liquidity, the fact that we do not intend to sell these securities, and that it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of the cost basis of these securities, these decreases in values are viewed as being temporary. For information regarding fair value measurements of our investment portfolio, refer to Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, of this Form 10-K. Commission Income: Commission income includes revenues from new and renewal commissions paid by insurance carriers, which we recognize when earned. Finance and Other Service Income. Finance and other service income includes revenues from premium installment charges, which we recognize when earned, and other miscellaneous income and fees. Finance and other service income decreased by 780, or 5.1 , to 14,461 for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 15,241 for the comparable 2021 period. The decrease is primarily driven by a change in our late fee assessment policy. Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by 30,252, or 6.6 , to 491,979 from 461,727 for the comparable 2021 period. The increase in losses is due to a return of pre-pandemic frequency in our private passenger automobile line of business and current market conditions including inflation and supply chain delays. Our GAAP loss ratio for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 64.9 and 59.6 , respectively. Our GAAP loss ratio excluding loss adjustment expenses was 56.0 and 50.0 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Total prior year favorable development included in the pre-tax results for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 57,279, compared to 53,673, for the comparable 2021 period. The increase in the prior year favorable development in 2022 is primarily related to the reversal of 6,500 legal expense reserve during the second quarter of 2022. Underwriting, Operating and Related Expenses. Underwriting, operating and related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased by 13,247, or 5.1 , to 245,145 from 258,392 for the comparable 2021 period. Our GAAP expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased to 32.3 from 33.4 for the comparable 2021 period. The 2022 decrease is driven by a decrease in contingent commission expense. Other Expense: Other expense includes the operating and related expenses associated with SNIA. Interest Expense. Interest expense was 524 and 522 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Interest expense primarily relates to the borrowing from the FHLB as noted within Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 10, Debt, of this Form 10-K. The credit facility commitment fee included in interest expense was 75 for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Income Tax Expense. Our effective tax rates were 21.9 and 20.4 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective rates for the year ended December 31, 2022 was higher than the statutory rate primary due to the impact of stock-based and executive compensation. The effective tax rates for the year end December 31, 2021 were lower than the statutory rates primarily due to the effects of tax-exempt investment income and the impact of stock-based compensation. The comparison of results for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 can be found in the Company s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 28, 2022.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources As a holding company, Safety s assets consist primarily of the stock of our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Our principal source of funds to meet our obligations and pay dividends to shareholders, therefore, is dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries, principally Safety Insurance. Safety is the borrower under our credit facility. Safety Insurance s sources of funds primarily include premiums received, investment income and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments. Safety Insurance s principal uses of cash are the payment of claims, operating expenses and taxes, the purchase of investments and payment of dividends to Safety. Net cash provided by operating activities was 44,326, 141,394, and 109,460 during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Our operations typically generate positive cash flows from operations as most premiums are received in advance of the time when claim and benefit payments are required. These positive operating cash flows are expected to continue to meet our liquidity requirements. Net cash used for investing activities was 19,988, 65,989, and 35,524 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, as purchases of fixed maturity and equity securities exceeded proceeds from the sales, paydowns, calls and maturities of fixed maturity and equity securities. Net cash used for financing activities was 62,641, 65,571, and 64,574 during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net cash used for financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 is comprised of dividend payments to shareholders and share buybacks, partially offset by the proceeds from a 5,000 borrowing from the FHLB-Boston on December 29, 2022. The borrowing was for a term of one-month, bearing interest at a rate of 4.34 , and was repaid on January 27, 2023. Net cash used for financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 is comprised of dividend payments to shareholders and share buybacks, partially offset by the proceeds from a 30,000 borrowing from the FHLB-Boston on March 17, 2020. The borrowing is for a term of five years, bearing interest at a rate of 1.42 . Interest is payable monthly, and the principal is due on the maturity date of March 17, 2025 but may be prepaid in whole or in part by the Company in advance. The Insurance Subsidiaries maintain a high degree of liquidity within their respective investment portfolios in fixed maturity and short-term investments. We do not anticipate the need to sell these securities to meet the Insurance Subsidiaries cash requirements. We expect the Insurance Subsidiaries to generate sufficient operating cash to meet all short-term and long-term cash requirements. However, there can be no assurance that unforeseen business needs or other items will not occur causing us to have to sell securities before their values fully recover; thereby causing us to recognize additional impairment charges in that time period. Credit Facility For information regarding our Credit Facility, please refer to Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 10, Debt, of this Form 10-K. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information regarding Recent Accounting Pronouncements, please refer to Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of this Form 10-K. Regulatory Matters Our insurance company s subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory restrictions that limit the maximum amount of dividends available to be paid to their parent without prior approval of the Commissioner. The Massachusetts statute limits the dividends an insurer may pay in any twelve-month period, without the prior permission of the

Table of Contents 
 Commissioner, to the greater of (i) 10 of the insurer s surplus as of the preceding December 31 or (ii) the insurer s net income for the twelve-month period ending the preceding December 31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. Our Insurance Subsidiaries may not declare an extraordinary dividend (defined as any dividend or distribution that, together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the limits established by Massachusetts statute) until thirty days after the Commissioner has received notice of the intended dividend and has not objected. As historically administered by the Commissioner, this provision requires the Commissioner s prior approval of an extraordinary dividend. Under Massachusetts law, an insurer may pay cash dividends only from its unassigned funds, also known as earned surplus, and the insurer s remaining surplus must be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs. At year-end 2022, the statutory surplus of Safety Insurance was 782,200, and its net income for 2022 was 66,197. As a result, a maximum of 78,220 is available in 2022 for such dividends without prior approval of the Commissioner. As a result of this Massachusetts statute, the Insurance Subsidiaries had restricted net assets in the amount of 703,980 at December 31, 2022. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, Safety Insurance recorded dividends to Safety of 94,260. The maximum dividend permitted by law is not indicative of an insurer s actual ability to pay dividends, which may be constrained by business and regulatory considerations, such as the impact of dividends on surplus, which could affect an insurer s ratings or competitive position, the amount of premiums that can be written and the ability to pay future dividends. Since the initial public offering of its common stock in November 2002, the Company has paid regular quarterly dividends to shareholders of its common stock. Quarterly dividends paid during 2022 and 2021 were as follows: Total Declaration Record Payment Dividend per Dividends Paid Date Date Date Common Share and Accrued February 16, 2021 March 5, 2021 March 15, 2021 0.90 13,459 May 5, 2021 June 1, 2021 June 15, 2021 0.90 13,490 August 4, 2021 September 1, 2021 September 15, 2021 0.90 13,493 November 3, 2021 December 1, 2021 December 15, 2021 0.90 13,554 February 15, 2022 March 5, 2022 March 15, 2022 0.90 13,248 May 6, 2022 June 1, 2022 June 15, 2022 0.90 13,278 August 3, 2022 September 1, 2022 September 15, 2022 0.90 13,262 November 2, 2022 December 1, 2022 December 15, 2022 0.90 13,207 On February 15, 2023, our Board approved and declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of 0.90 per share to be paid on March 15, 2023 to shareholders of record on March 1, 2023. We plan to continue to declare and pay quarterly cash dividends in 2023, depending on our financial position and the regularity of our cash flows. On February 23, 2022, the Board approved a share repurchase program of up to 50,000 of the Company s outstanding common shares. The Board of Directors had cumulatively authorized increases to the existing share repurchase program of up to 200,000 of its outstanding common shares. Under the program, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock for cash in public or private transactions, in the open market or otherwise. The timing of such repurchases and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, market conditions and applicable regulatory and corporate requirements. The program does not require the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had purchased 3,141,477 shares on the open market at a cost 150,000. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had purchased 2,970,573 shares on the open market at a cost of 135,397. In connection with the acquisition of Northeast / Metrowest, the Company reissued 58,113 shares valued at 5,000. The Company purchased an additional 170,904 shares on the open market at a cost of 14,603 through February 23, 2022. As of that date, the previously authorized share repurchase program in the amount of 150 million has been utilized. Management believes that the current level of cash flow from operations provides us with sufficient liquidity to meet our operating needs over the next 12 months. We expect to be able to continue to meet our operating needs after 
 46 

Table of Contents 
 the next 12 months from internally generated funds. Since our ability to meet our obligations in the long term (beyond such twelve-month period) is dependent upon such factors as market changes, insurance regulatory changes and economic conditions, no assurance can be given that the available net cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating needs. We expect that we would need to borrow or issue capital stock if we needed additional funds, for example, to pay for an acquisition or a significant expansion of our operations. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds for any of the foregoing purposes would be available to us at such time. Contractual Obligations We have obligations to make future payments under contracts and credit-related financial instruments and commitments. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had loss and LAE reserves of 549,598, unpaid reinsurance recoverables of 93,394 and net loss and LAE reserves of 456,204. Our loss and LAE reserves are estimates as described in more detail under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates . The specific amounts and timing of obligations related to case reserves, IBNR reserves and related LAE reserves are not set contractually, and the amounts and timing of these obligations are unknown. While management believes that historical performance of loss payment patterns is a reasonable source for projecting future claims payments, there is inherent uncertainty in this estimated projected settlement of loss and LAE reserves, and as a result these estimates will differ, perhaps significantly, from actual future payments. As part of the Company s investment activity, we have committed 160,000 to investments in limited partnerships. The Company has contributed 114,418 to these commitments as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining committed capital that could be called is 52,000, which includes potential recallable capital distributions. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves Significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting to us of that loss and our final payment of that loss. To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses, we establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities. Our reserves represent estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and estimated losses incurred but not yet reported IBNR and the expenses of investigating and paying those losses, or loss adjustment expenses. Every quarter, we review our previously established reserves and adjust them, if necessary. When a claim is reported, claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment. The amount of the reserve is primarily based upon an evaluation of the type of claim involved, the circumstances surrounding each claim and the policy provisions relating to the loss. The estimate reflects the informed judgment of such personnel based on general insurance reserving practices and on the experience and knowledge of the claims person. During the loss adjustment period, these estimates are revised as deemed necessary by our claims department based on subsequent developments and periodic reviews of the cases. When a claim is closed with or without a payment, the difference between the case reserve and the settlement amount creates a reserve deficiency if the payment exceeds the case reserve or a reserve redundancy if the payment is less than the case reserve. In accordance with industry practice, we also maintain reserves for IBNR. IBNR reserves are determined in accordance with commonly accepted actuarial reserving techniques on the basis of our historical information and experience. We review and make adjustments to incurred but not yet reported reserves quarterly. In addition, IBNR reserves can also be expressed as the total loss reserves required less the case reserves on reported claims.

 When reviewing reserves, we analyze historical data and estimate the impact of various loss development factors, such as our historical loss experience and that of the industry, trends in claims frequency and severity, our mix of business, our claims processing procedures, legislative enactments, judicial decisions, legal developments in imposition of damages, and changes and trends in general economic conditions, including the effects of inflation. A change in any of these factors from the assumption implicit in our estimate can cause our actual loss experience to be better or worse than our reserves, and the difference can be material. There is no precise method, however, for evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves, because the eventual development of reserves is affected by many factors. In estimating all our loss reserves, we follow the guidance prescribed by ASC 944, Financial Services Insurance. Management determines our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves estimate based upon the analysis of our actuaries. A reasonable estimate is derived by selecting a point estimate within a range of indications as calculated by our actuaries using generally accepted actuarial techniques. The key assumption in most actuarial analysis is that past patterns of frequency and severity will repeat in the future, unless a significant change in the factors described above takes place. Our key factors and resulting assumptions are the ultimate frequency and severity of claims, based upon the most recent ten years of claims reported to the Company, and the data CAR reports to us to calculate our share of the residual market, as of the date of the applicable balance sheet. For each accident year and each coverage within a line of business our actuaries calculate the ultimate losses incurred. Our total reserves are the difference between the ultimate losses incurred and the cumulative loss and loss adjustment payments made to date. Our IBNR reserves are calculated as the difference between our total reserves and the outstanding case reserves at the end of the accounting period. To determine ultimate losses, our actuaries calculate a range of indications and select a point estimation using such actuarial techniques as: Paid Loss Indications: This method projects ultimate loss estimates based upon extrapolations of historic paid loss trends. This method tends to be used on short tail lines such as automobile physical damage. Incurred Loss Indications: This method projects ultimate loss estimates based upon extrapolations of historic incurred loss trends. This method tends to be used on long tail lines of business such as automobile liability and homeowner s liability. Bornhuetter-Ferguson Indications: This method projects ultimate loss estimates based upon extrapolations of an expected amount of IBNR, which is added to current incurred losses or paid losses. This method tends to be used on small, immature, or volatile lines of business, such as our BOP and umbrella lines of business. Bodily Injury Code Indications: This method projects ultimate loss estimates for our private passenger and commercial automobile bodily injury coverage based upon extrapolations of the historic number of accidents and the historic number of bodily injury claims per accident. Projected ultimate bodily injury claims are then segregated into expected claims by type of injury (e.g. soft tissue injury vs. hard tissue injury) based on past experience. An ultimate severity, or average paid loss amounts, is estimated based upon extrapolating historic trends. Projected ultimate loss estimates using this method are the aggregate of estimated losses by injury type. 
 Such techniques assume that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting our ultimate losses, total reserves and resulting IBNR reserves. It is possible that the final outcome may fall above or below these amounts as a result of a number of factors, including immature data, sparse data, or significant growth in a line of business. Using these methodologies our actuaries established a range of reasonably possible estimations for net reserves of approximately 423,452 to 481,902 as of December 31, 2022 compared to a range of 445,511 to 504,580 as of December 31, 2021. In general, the low and high values of the ranges represent reasonable minimum and maximum values of the indications based on the techniques described above. Our selected point estimate of net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves based upon the analysis of our actuaries was 456,204 as of December 31, 2022 compared to 479,984 as of December 31, 2021.

Our IBNR reserves consist of our estimate of the total loss reserves required less our case reserves. The IBNR reserves for CAR assumed commercial automobile business are 40.3 of our total reserves for CAR assumed commercial automobile business as of December 31, 2022 due to the reporting delays in the information we receive from CAR, as described further in the section on Residual Market Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves. Our IBNR reserves for FAIR Plan assumed homeowners are 58.9 of our total reserves for FAIR Plan assumed homeowners at December 31, 2022 due to similar reporting delays in the information we receive from FAIR Plan.

 Residual Market Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves We are a participant in CAR, the FAIR Plan and other various residual markets and assume a portion of losses and LAE on business ceded by the industry participants to the residual markets. We estimate reserves for assumed losses and LAE that have not yet been reported to us by the residual markets. Our estimations are based upon the same factors we use for our own reserves, plus additional factors due to the nature of and the information we receive. Residual market deficits consist of premium ceded to the various residual markets less losses and LAE and is allocated among insurance companies based on a various formulas (the Participation Ratio that take into consideration a company s voluntary market share. Because of the lag in the various residual market estimations, and in order to try to validate to the extent possible the information provided, we estimate the effects of the actions of our competitors in order to establish our Participation Ratio. Although we rely to a significant extent in setting our reserves on the information the various residual markets provide, we are cautious in our use of that information, because of the delays in receiving data from the various residual markets. As a result, we have to estimate our Participation Ratio and these reserves are subject to significant judgments and estimates. Sensitivity Analysis Establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process. There can be no certainty that currently established reserves based on our key assumptions regarding frequency and severity in our lines of business, or our assumptions regarding our share of the CAR loss will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience. To the extent that reserves are inadequate and are strengthened, the amount of such increase is treated as a charge to earnings in the period that the deficiency is recognized. To the extent that reserves are redundant and are released, the amount of the release is a credit to earnings in the period the redundancy is recognized. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, a 1 percentage-point change in the loss and LAE ratio would result in a change in reserves of 7,588. Each 1 percentage-point change in the loss and loss expense ratio would have had a 5,995 effect on net income, or 0.41 per diluted share. Our assumptions consider that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, are an appropriate basis for establishing our reserves. Our individual key assumptions could each have a reasonable possible range of plus or minus 5 percentage-points for each estimation, although there is no guarantee that our assumptions will not have more than a 5 percentage point variation. The following sensitivity tables present information for each of our primary lines of business on the effect each 1 percentage-point change in each of our key assumptions on unpaid frequency and severity could have on our retained (i.e., direct minus ceded) loss and LAE reserves and net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. In evaluating the information in the table, it should be noted that a 1 percentage-point change in a single assumption would change estimated reserves by 1 percentage-point. A 1 percentage-point change in both our key assumptions would change estimated reserves within a range of plus or minus 2 percentage-points.

Our assumptions consider that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for establishing our CAR reserves. Each of our assumptions could have a reasonably possible range of plus or minus 5 percentage-points for each estimation. The following sensitivity table presents information of the effect each 1 percentage-point change in our assumptions on our share of reserves for CAR and other residual markets could have on our assumed loss and LAE reserves and net income for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Our prior year reserves decreased by 57,279, 53,673 and 54,844 during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The following table presents a comparison of prior year development of our net reserves for losses and LAE for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Each accident year represents all claims for an annual accounting period in which loss events occurred, regardless of when the losses are actually reported, booked or paid. Our financial statements reflect the aggregate results of the current and all prior accident years.

Our prior year reserves decreased by 57,279, 53,673, and 54,844 for the years ended 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The decreases in prior year reserves in 2022 resulted from re-estimations of prior year s ultimate loss and LAE liabilities and are primarily composed of reductions of 20,241 in our retained automobile reserves and 32,963 in our retained other than auto and homeowner s reserves. The decreases in prior year reserves in 2021 resulted from re-estimations of prior year s ultimate loss and LAE liabilities and are primarily composed of reductions of 22,313 in our retained automobile reserves and 26,220 in our retained other than auto and homeowner reserves. The decrease in prior year reserves during 2020 are primarily composed of reductions of 26,902 in our retained automobile reserves and 21,717 in our retained homeowners reserves. It is not appropriate to extrapolate future favorable or unfavorable development of reserves from this past experience.

 In estimating all our loss reserves, we follow the guidance prescribed by ASC 944, Financial Services-Insurance. For further information, see Results of Operations: Losses and Loss Adjustment Expense s. Investment Impairments The Company uses a systematic methodology to evaluate declines in fair values below cost or amortized cost of our investments. Some of the factors considered in assessing impairment of fixed maturities due to credit losses include the extent to which the fair value is less than amortized cost, the financial condition of and the near and long-term prospects of the issuer, whether the debtor is current on its contractually obligated interest and principal payments, changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, the historical volatility of the fair value of the security and whether it is more like than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment prior to an anticipated recovery in value. This methodology ensures that we evaluate available evidence concerning any declines in a disciplined manner. For fixed maturities that the Company does not intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the Company would not be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the Company separates the expected credit loss component of the impairment from the amount related to all other factors. The expected credit loss component is recognized as an allowance for expected credit losses. The allowance is adjusted for any additional credit losses and subsequent recoveries, which are booked in income as either credit loss expense or credit loss benefit, respectively. Upon recognizing a credit loss, the cost basis is not adjusted. The impairment related to all other factors (non-credit factors) is reported in other comprehensive income. For further information, see Results of Operations: Credit Loss Benefit (Expense). Forward-Looking Statements Forward-looking statements might include one or more of the following, among others: Projections of revenues, income, earnings per share, capital expenditures, dividends, capital structure or other financial items; Descriptions of plans or objectives of management for future operations, products or services; Forecasts of future economic performance, liquidity, need for funding and income; Legal and regulatory commentary; Descriptions of assumptions underlying or relating to any of the foregoing; and Future performance of credit markets. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words such as believe, expect, anticipate, intend, plan, estimate, aim, projects, or words of similar meaning and expressions that indicate future events and trends, or future or conditional verbs such as will, would, should, could, or may. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future, including statements about the Company s strategy for growth, product development, market position, expenditures and financial results, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. There are a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause actual future conditions, events, results or trends to differ significantly and/or materially from historical results or those projected in the forward-looking statements. These factors include but are not limited to: The competitive nature of our industry and the possible adverse effects of such competition; Conditions for business operations and restrictive regulations in Massachusetts; The possibility of losses due to claims resulting from severe weather; The impact of inflation and supply chain delays on loss severity;

 The possibility that the Commissioner may approve future rule changes that change the operation of the residual market; The possibility that existing insurance-related laws and regulations will become further restrictive in the future; Our possible need for and availability of additional financing, and our dependence on strategic relationships, among others; Other risks and factors identified from time to time in our reports filed with the SEC. Refer to Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors. Some other factors, such as market, operational, liquidity, interest rate, equity and other risks, are described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Factors relating to the regulation and supervision of our Company are also described or incorporated in this report. There are other factors besides those described or incorporated in this report that could cause actual conditions, events or results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. We do not undertake any obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made.

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk. Market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in market rates and prices. We have exposure to market risk through our investment activities and our financing activities. Our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates. We use both fixed and variable rate debt as sources of financing. We have not entered, and do not plan to enter, into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. Our exposure to interest rate changes primarily results from our significant holdings of fixed rate investments and from our financing activities. Our fixed maturity investments include U.S. and foreign government bonds, securities issued by government agencies, obligations of state and local governments and governmental authorities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities, most of which are exposed to changes in prevailing interest rates. We manage our exposure to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations through active review of our investment portfolio by our management and Board and consultation with third-party financial advisors. As a general matter, we do not attempt to match the durations of our assets with the durations of our liabilities, and the majority of our liabilities are short tail. Our goal is to maximize the total after-tax return on all of our investments. An important strategy that we employ to achieve this goal is to try to hold enough in cash and short-term investments in order to avoid liquidating longer-term investments to pay claims. Based upon the results of interest rate sensitivity analysis, the following table shows the interest rate risk of our investments in fixed maturities, measured in terms of fair value (which is equal to the carrying value for all our fixed maturity securities). 

-100 Basis +100 Basis Point Change No Change Point Change As of December 31, 2022 Estimated fair value 1,092,151 1,050,155 1,007,772 Estimated increase (decrease) in fair value 41,996 (42,383) As of December 31, 2021 Estimated fair value 1,261,399 1,218,279 1,174,068 Estimated increase (decrease) in fair value 43,120 (44,211) With respect to floating rate debt, we are exposed to the effects of changes in prevailing interest rates. At December 31, 2022, we had no debt outstanding under our credit facility. Assuming the full utilization of our current available credit facility, a 2.0 increase in the prevailing interest rate on our variable rate debt would result in interest expense increasing approximately 600 for 2022, assuming that all of such debt is outstanding for the entire year. In addition, in the current market environment, our investments can also contain liquidity risks. Equity Risk. Equity risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in equity prices. Our exposure to changes in equity prices results from our holdings of common stock and mutual funds held to fund the executive deferred compensation plan. We continuously evaluate market conditions and we expect in the future to purchase additional equity securities. We principally manage equity price risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation techniques.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Safety Insurance Group, Inc. Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Safety Insurance Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows, for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
 58 

Table of Contents 
 principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Losses and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves Refer to Notes 2 and 12 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company establishes loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported losses and the expenses associated with investigating and paying the losses, or loss adjustment expenses. The loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are determined in accordance with commonly accepted actuarial reserving techniques on the basis of the Company s historical information and experience. In determining the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, the Company analyzes historical data and estimates the impact of various loss development factors, such as the Company s historical loss experience and that of the industry, trends in claims frequency and severity, the Company s mix of business, the Company s claims processing procedures, legislative enactments, judicial decisions, legal developments in imposition of damages, and changes and trends in general economic conditions, including the effects of inflation. Given the subjectivity of estimating the ultimate cost to settle the liabilities for reported and unreported losses due to uncertainties caused by various factors including frequency and severity of claims, as well as future legislative, judicial, and legal uncertainties, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether the ultimate cost of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves were appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2022 required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to loss and loss adjustment expense reserves included the following, among others: 1. We tested the effectiveness of the Company s controls related to loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, including controls over inputs, methods, and assumptions used in the Company s estimation process. 2. We tested the underlying data that served as the basis for the Company s analysis, including historical claims, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimate were complete and accurate. 3. With the assistance of our actuarial specialists, we evaluated the methods and assumptions used by the Company to estimate loss and loss adjustment expense reserves by: a. Assessing the reasonableness of the Company s analysis, developing independent estimates of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and comparing such estimates to the Company s recorded loss and

Table of Contents 
 loss adjustment expense reserves. b. Comparing the Company s prior year estimates of expected incurred losses to actual experience during the current year to identify potential management bias in the determination of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. Northeast Metrowest Insurance Agency, Inc. Acquisition Refer to Note 2 to the Financial Statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company completed the acquisition of Northeast Metrowest Insurance Agency, Inc. Northeast on December 1, 2022. The Company accounted for the acquisition of Northeast under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, including customer relationship intangible assets. Management estimated the fair value of such intangible assets using an income approach that considered cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired business relationships, a weighted average cost of capital discount rate reflecting the relative risk of achieving the anticipated cash flows, profits, the time value of money and other relevant inputs. Changes in the assumptions could impact the amount allocated to acquired intangible assets and ultimately the amount recorded as goodwill. Given the fair value determination of customer relationship intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding projected cash flows and discount rates, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of those estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment, and an increased extent of effort, including involving fair value specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the fair value of distribution and customer relationship intangible assets acquired from Northeast included the following, among others: 1. We tested the effectiveness of controls over the valuation methodology used for these acquired intangible assets, including management s controls over assumptions used in developing estimated future cash flows, and discount rates used to present value cash flows. 2. We assessed the reasonableness of management s forecasts by comparing the projection to historical cash flow results of Northeast, as well as to certain peer companies of Northeast. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of changes in assumptions to the valuation of the customer relationship intangible assets. 3. We assessed the knowledge, skill, ability and objectivity of management s valuation specialist and evaluated the work performed. 4. With the assistance of fair value specialists, we evaluated: The reasonableness of the valuation methodology, and The reasonableness of the discount rate used to present value the expected cash flows by: a. Testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and testing mathematical accuracy of the calculation. b. Developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management to evaluate the inputs used in the calculation. 5. We evaluated whether the estimated cash flows were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

Commission revenue includes new and renewal commissions paid by insurance carriers. These commissions are earned at the later of the effective date or billing date, as all rights are passed to the insured, the obligation to pay a claim resides with the insurance carrier, and no further performance obligation exists for the Company.

 Residential mortgage-backed securities Commercial mortgage-backed securities Other asset-backed securities Corporate and other securities Subtotal, fixed maturity securities Equity securities Total temporarily impaired securities At December 31, 2022, U.S. Government residential mortgage backed securities with a fair value of are pledged as collateral for a borrowing with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston FHLB-Boston as described in Note 10 Debt. These securities are included in fixed maturity securities on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Impairments For fixed maturities that the Company does not intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the Company would not be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the Company separates the credit loss component of the impairment from the amount related to all other factors. The expected credit loss component is recognized as an allowance for expected credit losses. The allowance is adjusted for any additional credit losses and subsequent recoveries, which are booked in income as either credit loss expense or credit loss benefit, respectively. Upon recognizing a credit loss, the cost basis is not adjusted. The impairment related to all other factors (non-credit factors) is reported in other comprehensive income. For fixed maturities where the Company records a credit loss, a determination is made as to the cause of the impairment and whether the Company expects a recovery in the value. For fixed maturities where the Company expects a recovery in value, the constant effective yield method is utilized, and the investment is amortized to par. For fixed maturity investments the Company intends to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the full amount of the impairment is included in credit loss expense. The new cost basis of the investment is the previous amortized cost basis less the impairment recognized in credit loss expense. The new cost basis is not adjusted for any subsequent recoveries in fair value. The Company uses a systematic methodology to evaluate declines in fair values below cost or amortized cost of our investments. Some of the factors considered in assessing impairment of fixed maturities due to credit losses include the extent to which the fair value is less than amortized cost, the financial condition of and the near and long-term prospects of the issuer, whether the debtor is current on its contractually obligated interest and principal payments, changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, the historical volatility of the fair value of the security and whether it is more like than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment prior to an anticipated recovery in value. As of December 31, 2022, the Company concluded that of unrealized losses were due to credit factors and were recorded as an allowance for expected credit losses, compared to as of December 31, 2021. The Company concluded that outside of the securities that were recognized as credit impaired, the unrealized losses recorded on the fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2022 and 2021 resulted from fluctuations in market interest rates and other temporary market conditions as opposed to fundamental changes in the credit quality of the issuers of such securities. Based upon the analysis performed, the Company s decision to hold these securities, the Company s current level of liquidity and our history of positive operating cash flows, management believes it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell any of its securities before the anticipated recovery in the fair value to its amortized cost basis.

 Reinsurance recoverables include amounts due from reinsurers for both paid and unpaid losses. The Company cedes insurance to CAR and to other reinsurers. The Company has a property catastrophe excess of loss agreement and a casualty excess of loss agreement that qualify as reinsurance treaties and are designed to protect against large or unusual loss and LAE activity. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the Company from its obligations to policyholders. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. The Company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors economic characteristics of the reinsurers to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies. The Company reports its reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for estimated uncollectable reinsurance. A probability-of-default methodology which reflects current and forecasted economic conditions is used to estimate the amount of uncollectible reinsurance due to credit-related factors and the estimate is reported in an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance. Amounts deemed to be uncollectible, including amounts due from known insolvent reinsurers, are written off against the allowance. Changes in the allowance, as well as any subsequent collections of amounts previously written off, are reported as part of claims and claim adjustment expenses. The majority of the Company s reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses is a result of our participation as a servicing carrier in the CAR Commercial Automobile Program, which represents of the total reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The remaining of amounts due from reinsurers are related to our other excess of loss and quota share contracts. For amounts due under these contracts, the Company utilizes updated A.M. Best credit ratings on a quarterly basis to determine the allowance for expected credit losses. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, all reinsurers under these programs are rated A or better by A.M. Best. Certain of the Company s reinsurance recoverables are collateralized by letters of credit, funds held or trust agreements.

Service-based restricted stock awards generally vest over a period and vest on the first and second anniversaries of the grant date and on the third anniversary of the grant date, except for non-executive employees restricted stock awards granted prior to 2018 which vest ratably over a service period and independent directors stock awards which vest immediately.

In addition to service-based awards, the Company grants performance-based restricted shares to certain employees. These performance shares cliff vest after a performance period provided certain performance measures are attained. A portion of these awards, which contain a market condition, vest according to the level of total shareholder return achieved by the Company compared to its property-casualty insurance peers over a period. The remainder, which contain a performance condition, vest according to the level of Company s combined ratio results compared to a target based on its property-casualty insurance peers. Actual payouts can range from to of target shares awarded depending upon the level of achievement of the respective market and performance conditions during a three calendar-year performance period. Compensation expense for share awards with a performance condition is based on the probable number of awards expected to vest using the performance level most likely to be achieved at the end of the performance period. Performance-based awards with market conditions are accounted for and measured differently from awards that have a performance or service condition. The effect of a market condition is reflected in the award s fair value on the grant date. That fair value is recognized as compensation cost over the requisite service period regardless of whether the market-based performance objective has been satisfied. All of the Company s restricted stock awards are issued as incentive compensation and are equity classified.

 period, without the prior permission of the Commissioner, to the greater of (i) of the insurer s surplus as of the preceding December 31 or (ii) the insurer s net income for the twelve- month period ending the preceding December 31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. Our insurance company subsidiaries may not declare an extraordinary dividend (defined as any dividend or distribution that, together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the limits established by Massachusetts statute) until after the Commissioner has received notice of the intended dividend and has not objected. As historically administered by the Commissioner, this provision requires the Commissioner s prior approval of an extraordinary dividend. Under Massachusetts law, an insurer may pay cash dividends only from its unassigned funds, also known as earned surplus, and the insurer s remaining surplus must be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs. At December 31, 2022, the statutory capital and surplus of Safety Insurance was and its net income for 2022 was . As a result, a maximum of is available in 2023 for such dividends without prior approval of the Commissioner. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Safety Insurance recorded dividends of . As result of this Massachusetts statute, the Insurance Subsidiaries had restricted net assets in the amount of at December 31, 2022. Risk-Based Capital Requirements The NAIC has adopted a formula and model law to implement risk-based capital requirements for most property and casualty insurance companies, which are designed to determine minimum capital requirements and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policyholder obligations. Under Massachusetts law, insurers having less total adjusted capital than that required by the risk-based capital calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy. The risk-based capital law provides for levels of regulatory action. The extent of regulatory intervention and action increases as the level of total adjusted capital to risk-based capital falls. As of December 31, 2022, the Insurance Subsidiaries had total adjusted capital of , which is in excess of amounts requiring company or regulatory action at any prescribed risk-based capital action level. Minimum statutory capital and surplus, or company action level risk-based capital, was at December 31, 2022.

 ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENT S WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE On June 1, 2021, Deloitte and Touche LLP Deloitte was engaged as the new independent registered public accounting firm of Safety to perform independent audit services for the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021. Deloitte s engagement was approved by the Audit Committee of the Board. The appointment of Deloitte was a result of a competitive request for proposal process undertaken by the Audit Committee. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP s PwC audit report on the Company s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, there were (i) no disagreements (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) between the Company and PwC on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of PwC would have caused PwC to make reference thereto in its reports on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for such years, and (ii) no reportable events (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, neither the Company, nor any party on behalf of the Company, consulted with Deloitte with respect to either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered with respect to the Company s consolidated financial statements, and no written report or oral advice was provided to the Company by Deloitte that was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching its decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue, or (ii) any matter that was subject to any disagreement (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) or a reportable event (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures [as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )] as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are adequate and effective and ensure that all information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and that information required to be disclosed in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our 
 98 

Table of Contents 
 evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. Deloitte Touche LLP, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of Safety Insurance Group, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, as stated in their report which is included herein. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the eleven months ended December 1, 2022, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and the Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm are set forth in Item 8. In accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company may exclude acquisitions from management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the first year in which the acquisition occurred. The Company s management has excluded the assessment of internal controls of SNIA, which was acquired on December 1, 2022, and further discussed in Note 1, Basis of Presentation. As December 31, 2022, SNIA accounted for an immaterial amount of consolidated assets and revenue. Other than the matter described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings Other Than Those by or in the Right of the Corporation . Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. Section 2. Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation . Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, 
 18 

 employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper. Section 3. Authorization of Indemnification . Any indemnification under this Article VIII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made (1) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (2) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the stockholders. To the extent, however, that a director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case. Section 4. Good Faith Defined . For purposes of any determination under Section 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful, if his or her action is based on the records or books of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on information supplied to him or her by the officers of the Corporation or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel 
 19 

 for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The term another enterprise as used in this Section 4 shall mean any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. The provisions of this Section 4 shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Section 5. Indemnification by a Court . Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any director or officer may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application. Section 6. Expenses Payable in Advance . Expenses incurred by a director or officer in defending or investigating a threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article VIII. 
 20 

 Section 7. Nonexclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses . The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any Bylaw, agreement, contract, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or pursuant to the direction (howsoever embodied) of any court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of the persons specified in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Article VIII shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in Section 1 or 2 of this Article VIII but whom the Corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the DGCL or otherwise. Section 8. Insurance . The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of this Article VIII. Section 9. Certain Definitions . For purposes of this Article VIII, references to the Corporation shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers, so that any person who is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation, or is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VIII with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. For purposes of this Article VIII, references to fines shall include any 
 21 

 excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to serving at the request of the Corporation shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director or officer with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation as referred to in this Article VIII. Section 10. Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses . The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VIII shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. Section 11. Limitation on Indemnification . Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article VIII to the contrary, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification (which shall be governed by Section 5 hereof), the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Section 12. Indemnification of Employees and Agents . The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation similar to those conferred in this Article VIII to directors and officers of the Corporation. ARTICLE IX AMENDMENTS Section 1. These Bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed, in whole or in part, or new Bylaws may be adopted by the stockholders or by the Board of Directors, provided, however, that notice of such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption of new Bylaws be contained in the notice of such meeting of stockholders or Board of Directors as the case may be. All such amendments must be approved by either the holders of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast 
 22 

 by the holders of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote thereon or by a majority of the Board of Directors then in office; provided, however, Article II, Section 2 (except for the first paragraph thereof) and Section 3; Article III, Section 1 (except for the first paragraph thereof); and this Article IX, Section 1 may be altered, amended or repealed only with approval of the holders of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote thereon and a majority of the Board of Directors then in office. ARTICLE X AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION If there is a conflict between the provisions of these Bylaws and the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or the mandatory provisions of the DGCL, such provision or provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and DGCL, as the case may be, will be controlling.
