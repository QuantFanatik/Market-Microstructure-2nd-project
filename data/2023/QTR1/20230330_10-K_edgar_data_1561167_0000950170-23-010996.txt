 The depositor has been notified by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells Fargo of material pending legal proceedings to which Wells Fargo is subject in connection with its role as trustee on certain RMBS transactions. This Sequoia transaction is not a party to nor subject to the pending legal proceedings. 
 
 The disclosure that the depositor received from Wells Fargo is included here: 
 
 Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. 
 
 In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF Limited (Phoenix Light) and certain related entities filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging claims against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in its capacity as trustee for a number of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) trusts. Complaints raising similar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in 
 4 

the Southern District of New York and by IKB International and IKB Deutsche Industriebank in New York state court. In each case, the plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, caused losses to investors, and plaintiffs assert causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee s alleged failure to notify and enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, notify investors of alleged events of default, and abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. In July 2022, the district court dismissed Phoenix Light s claims and certain of the claims asserted by Commerzbank AG, and subsequently entered judgment in each case in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. In August 2022, Phoenix Light and Commerzbank AG appealed the district court s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Company previously settled two class actions filed by institutional investors and an action filed by the National Credit Union Administration with similar allegations. In addition, Park Royal I LLC and Park Royal II LLC have filed substantially similar lawsuits in New York state court alleging Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, failed to take appropriate actions upon learning of defective mortgage loan documentation. 
 
 Item 1119 of Regulation AB, Affiliations and Certain Relationships and Related Transactions. 
 The seller and servicing administrator, the sponsor and the depositor are each either directly or indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries of Redwood Trust, Inc. There is not currently, and there was not during the past two years, any material business relationship, agreement, arrangement, transaction or understanding that is or was entered into outside the ordinary course of business or is or was on terms other than would be obtained in an arm s length transaction with an unrelated third party, between (a) any of the seller, the sponsor, the depositor and the issuing entity on the one hand and (b) any of the trustee, any servicer, the custodian, the master servicer, the securities administrator or either originator of the mortgage loans on the other hand. 
 Item 1122 of Regulation AB, Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria. 
 The reports on assessment of compliance with the servicing criteria for asset-backed securities and the related attestation reports on such assessments of compliance are attached hereto under Item 15. 
 The registrant has prepared the Table below in connection with this transaction. The Table shows, in one compiled format, which entity participating in a servicing function for this transaction was assigned responsibility for each criterion in Item 1122(d). In the Table below, certain criteria are not applicable, given the structure of the offering, and accordingly no entity is assigned responsibility for such criteria. 
 On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo transferred substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services business to Computershare Trust Company, N.A. CTCNA and its affiliates. For certain transactions where one or more of Wells Fargo's roles did not transfer to CTCNA on November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo engaged CTCNA as its agent to perform certain duties under the related transaction documents. Therefore, the reports on assessment of compliance with the servicing criteria for asset-backed securities and the related attestation reports on such assessments of compliance of CTCNA, as agent to Wells Fargo in its capacities as master servicer and custodian are included under Item 15. 
 Also, Christiana Trust, a division of Wilmington Savings Fund Society FSB Christiana ), the trustee, does not participate in any servicing function for the transaction that is the subject of this 10-K filing. Therefore, there is no reference to Christiana in the chart below; nor does this 10-K filing include any assessment or auditor report from Christiana. Finally, any discrepancies between the chart below and the assessment of compliance exhibit provided by any party listed in the chart is explained by the fact that the chart is specific to the transaction that is the subject of this 10-K filing, whereas each party s respective assessment of compliance is issued on a platform basis and includes coverage of other additional transactions that are not the subject of this 10-K filing.

The Revised PSA inadvertently and mistakenly indicates by X that Citibank performs Reg AB Item 1122(d)(4)(xiv). However, this Chart, as well as Citibank s management assessment report and report of the independent accountants are accurate in that Reg AB Item 1122(d)(4)(xiv) is not performed by Citibank. This Reg AB Item 1122(d)(4)(xiv) servicing criteria function is being performed by other parties. In this SEMT 2012-6 transaction, the Reg AB Item 1122(d)(4)(xiv) servicing criteria function is performed by Wells Fargo (or CTCNA as its agent), as master servicer, and by underlying servicers PHH Mortgage Corporation, First Republic Bank and Cenlar FSB.

The Revised PSA indicates by X that Cenlar FSB performs Reg AB Items 1122(d)(4)(i-ii). However, Cenlar FSB s management assessment report and report of the independent accountants state that Reg AB Items 1122(d)(4)(i-ii) are not performed by Cenlar. In this SEMT 2012-6 transaction, the Reg AB Items 1122(d)(4)(i-ii) servicing criteria functions, as to Cenlar FSB, are instead performed by Wells Fargo (or CTCNA as its agent), as custodian. 

Computershare Trust Company, National Association 
 The report on assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria furnished pursuant to Item 1122 of Regulation AB by Computershare Trust Company, National Association (the Company for its master servicing platform discloses that a material instance of noncompliance occurred, as described below: 
 
 Material Instance of Noncompliance by the Company 
 Management s assessment of compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB for the Period, disclosed that a material instance of noncompliance occurred with respect to the servicing criterion set forth in Item 1122(d)(2)(v) as follows: 
 
 With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(v), custodial accounts for certain transactions on the RMBS Master Servicing Platform were not maintained at a federally insured depository institution as set forth in the transaction agreements because they did not satisfy account eligibility requirements. 

Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(2)(v) provides as follows: 
 
 Each custodial account is maintained at a federally insured depository institution as set forth in the transaction agreements. For purposes of this criterion, federally insured depository institution with respect to a foreign financial institution means a foreign financial institution that meets the requirements of 240.13k-1(b)(1) of this chapter.

 a) General . The transaction agreements for the Company s RMBS Master Servicing Platform transactions require the institutions maintaining custodial accounts for each transaction to satisfy certain eligibility criteria. Generally, such eligibility criteria can be satisfied if the institution holding the account either (i) possesses requisite long and/or short-term credit ratings from the specified rating agency(ies) (collectively, the Requisite Ratings ), or (ii) satisfies one of the other alternative means of establishing account eligibility (collectively, Alternative Means ). With respect to certain custodial accounts that remained at Wells Fargo after Wells Fargo s sale of its Corporate Trust Services division to Computershare and during the Period, Management has determined that such custodial accounts were not maintained as set forth in the transaction agreements because (i) Wells Fargo s or Wells Fargo s holding company, as applicable, long and/or short-term issuer ratings during the Period were lower than the related Requisite Ratings thresholds for such transactions, and (ii) there was no Alternative Means during the Period to satisfy account eligibility requirements for such transactions. 

b) Background . Management for the Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo disclosed account eligibility noncompliance as a material instance of noncompliance on its RMBS Master Servicing Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria for the 2019, 2020, and 2021 2 reporting periods. As of November 1, 2021, as part of the purchase of the Corporate Trust Services division from Wells Fargo, Computershare Trust Company, as Wells Fargo s agent, began performing the activities related to Item 1122(d)(2)(v) for its RMBS Master Servicing Platform transactions, which included the affected transactions with account eligibility noncompliance. As a result, Computershare Trust Company also disclosed the account eligibility noncompliance as a material instance of noncompliance on its RMBS Master Servicing Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria for the two month period of November 1, 2021 through and including December 31, 2021. 

c) Current Scope . As of the end of the Period, Management has determined that approximately one quarter of the 1,449 RMBS Master Servicing Platform transactions listed on Appendix A to the Company's 2022 Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria have account eligibility noncompliance. Each of the transactions with account eligibility noncompliance are part of the Company s Agent Role Transactions (as defined on the first page of the Company's 2022 

12 

Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria). While the scope of account eligibility noncompliance is quantitatively material for the RMBS Master Servicing Platform, Management believes that the account eligibility noncompliance does not have a material impact on either (i) the Company s ability to master service the transactions in accordance with the transaction agreements, or (ii) the securities issued in connection with the related transactions or the investors holding such securities. 

d) Remediation . With the purchase of the Corporate Trust Services division from Wells Fargo on November 1, 2021, the Company has taken responsibility for remediating RMBS Master Servicing Platform transactions with account eligibility noncompliance since it is performing the activities related to Item 1122(d)(2)(v). The Company intends to address the account eligibility noncompliance as part of its ongoing transition of the corporate trust business and may either move the affected accounts to banking institutions with Requisite Ratings or pursue Alternative Means to satisfy account eligibility requirements such as seeking a rating agency confirmation from relevant rating agencies. During the Period, the Company conveyed this intent to some of the trustees for some of the affected transactions in response to a status request.

 1 Management s Discussion of the Material Instance of Noncompliance is not subject to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP s attestation. 
 
 2 Due to the sale of the corporate trust services division to Computershare on November 1, 2021, and for purposes of its servicing activities related to Item 1122(d)(2)(v) of Regulation AB, Wells Fargo s 2021 reporting period for its RMBS Master Servicing Platform was from January 1, 2021 through and including October 31, 2021. 
 
 The identified instance did not involve the servicing of the assets backing the asset-backed securities covered in this Form 10-K.

Management Assessment 
 Management of the Cenlar FSB (Cenlar or the Bank) is responsible for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of residential mortgage loans (the Platform), except for servicing criteria 1122 (d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(b)-(c), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(xi), as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. These criteria are not applicable to the Bank because the Bank does not perform activities with respect to the Platform relating to these criteria. Appendix A identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(i), management has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria, has determined that these vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Bank has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations of the Division of Corporation Finance, Section 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Bank asserts that it has policies and procedures in place, designed and operating effectively, to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Bank is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria as described in our assertion. 
 The Bank's management has assessed the Bank's compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 11 22 of Regulation AB. 
 Based on such assessment, management has concluded that, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Bank has complied in all material respects with the servicing criteria, except as set forth in the column titled Inapplicable Servicing Criteria on Appendix B, set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of the Platform. 
 Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to management 's assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Management s Assertion 
 
 Management of First Republic Bank (the Bank) is responsible for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of residential mortgage loans serviced for others (the Platform), except for the servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(C) and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Bank has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Appendix A identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. 
 With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii), management has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Bank s management has determined that none of these vendors is considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Bank s management has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). Management has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Bank s management is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criteria. 
 The Bank s management has assessed the Bank s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set 
 forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 
 Based on such assessment, management believes that, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Bank has complied in all material respects with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of the Platform. 
 KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to the Bank s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Appendix B to the Company s Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria 

Wells Fargo s transfer of its roles on the Document Custody Platform transactions to Computershare is ongoing. As of the beginning of the Period, Wells Fargo has not transferred to Computershare its document custody related roles, and the duties, rights, and liabilities for such roles, under the relevant agreements for any of the Document Custody Platform transactions. During the Period, for all the Document Custody Platform transactions, Wells Fargo engaged Computershare as a subservicer to perform virtually all of Wells Fargo s obligations under the transaction agreements. As a result, the Company has determined that Computershare is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the Document Custody Platform and the applicable servicing criteria relevant to the servicing activities performed by Computershare for the Document Custody Platform (the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Accordingly, Computershare is taking, and Wells Fargo is not taking, responsibility for assessing Computershare s compliance with the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Document Custody Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 
 RMBS Master Servicing Platform 
 
 The management Management of the Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the Company or Wells Fargo is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable in regard to the servicing platform for the period as follows: 
 Sale of Corporate Trust Services Business . On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to Computershare Trust Company, N.A. Computershare Trust Company ), Computershare Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare Limited , and collectively with Computershare Trust Company and CDTC, Computershare ). Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the sale. See Appendix B for more information regarding such transition as it relates to the RMBS Master Servicing Platform (defined below). 
 Period : As of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 (the Period ). 
 Platform : The platform consists of residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS transactions backed by pools of residential mortgage loans and/or backed by RMBS, for which the Company was appointed to perform master servicing services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for such RMBS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued securities for such RMBS transactions were privately offered pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity, other than certain RMBS transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (the RMBS Master Servicing Platform ). As a result of Wells Fargo s sale of the CTS division to Computershare, Wells Fargo has not accepted any appointments to perform master servicing services on new RMBS Master Servicing transactions after November 1, 2021, other than a few exceptions to facilitate the transition of the CTS business to Computershare. Appendix A identifies the individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the RMBS Master Servicing Platform for the Period. 
 Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period : Management has determined that the following servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are relevant to the servicing activities performed by the Company with respect to the RMBS Master Servicing Platform for the Period: 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iii), and 1122(d)(2)(vi) (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Management has determined that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are not applicable to the Company s servicing activities with respect to the RMBS Master Servicing Platform for the Period. 
 With respect to the RMBS Master Servicing Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment of the Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 

2022 Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. All rights reserved. 

1.	Management is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 
 2.	Management has assessed the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. In performing this assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 
 3.	With respect to Applicable Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(2)(iii), Management has determined that there were no activities performed during the Period with respect to the RMBS Master Servicing Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. 
 4.	Based on such assessment for the Period, the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period. 
 KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to Management s assessment of the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

Appendix B to the Company s Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria 

Wells Fargo s transfer of its roles on the RMBS Master Servicing Platform transactions to Computershare is ongoing. As of the beginning of the Period, Wells Fargo has not transferred to Computershare the roles associated with its master servicing services, and the duties, rights, and liabilities for such roles, under the relevant agreements for any of the RMBS Master Servicing Platform transactions. During the Period, for all the RMBS Master Servicing Platform transactions, Wells Fargo engaged Computershare as a subservicer to perform virtually all of Wells Fargo s obligations pertaining to such roles under the transaction agreements. As a result, the Company has determined that Computershare is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the RMBS Master Servicing Platform and the applicable servicing criteria relevant to the servicing activities performed by Computershare for the RMBS Master Servicing Platform (the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Accordingly, Computershare is taking, and Wells Fargo is not taking, responsibility for assessing Computershare s compliance with the Computershare Applicable Servicing Criteria for the RMBS Master Servicing Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.

 Platform : Publicly-issued i.e., transaction-level reporting initially required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) and certain privately-issued i.e., for which transaction-level reporting is required pursuant to contractual obligation) residential mortgage-backed securities issued on or after January 1, 2006, as listed in Appendix A, for which the Company provides the following servicing functions: 
 
 paying agent, securities administration and trustee; or 

securities administration and paying agent; or

 Applicable Servicing Criteria : All servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d), to the extent required by Item 1122(d) servicing criteria in regards to the activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platform as to any transaction, except for the following servicing criteria: 1122(d)(1)(iii)-1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(iii), 1122(d)(4)(i)-1122(d)(4)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(iv)-1122(d)(4)(xiv), which management has determined are not applicable to the activities the Company performs with respect to the Platform (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ).

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA 
 Computershare Corporate Trust- Document Custody Platform 
 
 The management Management of the Computershare Corporate Trust division of Computershare Trust Company, National Association (the Company is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the servicing platform for the period as follows: 
 Purchase of corporate trust business . On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to the Company, Computershare Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare Limited , and collectively with the Company and CDTC, Computershare ). Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the sale. 
 For the Document Custody Platform (defined below) transactions and during the Period, the Company either (i) served directly in the related document custody services role (collectively, the Document Custody Platform Role ), or (ii) served as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related Document Custody Platform Role. More specifically, since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo CTS business on November 1, 2021, the Company has closed new Document Custody transactions for which, during all or a portion of the Period, it performed the related Document Custody Platform Role directly (the Company s Direct Role Transactions ). The Company s Direct Role Transactions comprise a small percentage of the overall Document Custody Platform transactions. For a significant majority of Document Custody Platform transactions, the Company served, during all or a portion of the Period, as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related Document Custody Platform Role (the Company s Agent Role Transactions ). Wells Fargo had not, as of the beginning of the Period, transferred to Computershare the Document Custody Platform Role for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, and therefore the Company performed, during all or a portion of the Period, virtually all of Wells Fargo s contractual duties for such transactions as its agent. As a result, for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo have determined that the Company is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the Document Custody Platform, and accordingly, the Company is taking responsibility for assessing its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria (defined below) relevant to the servicing activities performed by the Company for the Document Custody Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. 
 Period : As of January 1, 2022 through and including December 31, 2022 (the Period ). 
 Platform : The platform consists of residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS transactions, commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions, and other asset-backed securities ABS transactions, in each case for which the Company provides document custody services, either directly in the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were publicly offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were privately offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company (and/or the party for whom it acts as agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. 

government or any government-sponsored entity, other than certain RMBS transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (the Document Custody Platform ). Appendix A identifies the individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the Document Custody Platform for the Period. 
 Applicable Servicing Criteria : Management has determined that the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii) are applicable to the Company s obligations, or the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the Document Custody Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s Obligations ); provided however that, with respect to the Document Custody Platform, servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s Obligation to review and maintain the required loan documents related to any additions, removals or substitutions in accordance with the transaction agreements (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). Management has determined that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are not applicable to the Company s Obligations with respect to the Document Custody Platform for the Period. 
 Third parties classified as vendors : With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii), for certain ABS transactions included in the Document Custody Platform, the Company has engaged a vendor to handle certain aspects of maintaining and safeguarding pool assets, the security thereon, and related documents as required by such servicing criteria. Management has determined that the vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Management elects to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii) applicable to this vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 . The Company has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to the vendor. Management is solely responsible for determining that the Company meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and the related servicing criteria. 
 With respect to the Document Custody Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment of the Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 
 1. Management is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 
 2. Management has assessed the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including the servicing criteria for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above. In performing this assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 
 3. With respect to Applicable Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has determined that there were no activities performed during the Period with respect to the Document Custody Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. 
 4. Based on such assessment for the Period, the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to Management s assessment of the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

Management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable to the servicing platform for the period as follows: 
 Purchase of corporate trust business . On November 1, 2021, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells Fargo and certain of its affiliates sold substantially all of its Corporate Trust Services CTS division to the Company, Computershare Delaware Trust Company CDTC ), and Computershare Limited Computershare Limited , and collectively with the Company and CDTC, Computershare ). Virtually all CTS employees of Wells Fargo, along with most existing CTS systems, technology, and offices transferred to Computershare as part of the sale. 
 For the RMBS Master Servicing Platform (defined below) transactions and during the Period, the Company either (i) served directly in the related master servicing services role (collectively, the RMBS Master Servicing Platform Role ), or (ii) served as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related RMBS Master Servicing Platform Role. More specifically, since its acquisition of the Wells Fargo CTS business on November 1, 2021, the Company has closed new RMBS transactions for which, during all or a portion of the Period, it performed the related RMBS Master Servicing Platform Role directly (the Company s Direct Role Transactions ). The Company s Direct Role Transactions comprise a small percentage of the overall RMBS Master Servicing Platform transactions. For a significant majority of RMBS Master Servicing Platform transactions, the Company served, during all or a portion of the Period, as agent for Wells Fargo who remained in the related RMBS Master Servicing Platform Role (the Company s Agent Role Transactions ). Wells Fargo had not, as of the beginning of the Period, transferred to Computershare the RMBS Master Servicing Platform Role for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, and therefore the Company performed, during all or a portion of the Period, virtually all of Wells Fargo s contractual duties for such transactions as its agent. As a result, for the Company s Agent Role Transactions, the Company and Wells Fargo have determined that the Company is a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the RMBS Master Servicing Platform, and accordingly, the Company is taking responsibility for assessing its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria (defined below) relevant to the servicing activities performed by the Company for the RMBS Master Servicing Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. 
 Period : As of January 1, 2022 through and including December 31, 2022 (the Period ). 
 Platform : The platform consists of residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS transactions backed by pools of residential mortgage loans and/or backed by RMBS, for which the Company provides master servicing services either directly in the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for such RMBS transactions were publicly offered pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued securities for such RMBS transactions were privately offered pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company (and/or the party for whom it acts as agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity, other than certain RMBS transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (the RMBS Master Servicing Platform ). Appendix A identifies the individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the RMBS Master Servicing Platform for the Period. 

Applicable Servicing Criteria : All servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are applicable to either the Company s obligations , or the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the RMBS Master Servicing Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s Obligations ), except for the following servicing criteria: 1122(d)(3)(i)(C), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii) and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which Management has determined are not applicable to the Company s Obligations in the related transaction agreements with respect to the RMBS Master Servicing Platform for the Period; provided however that, with respect to the RMBS Master Servicing Platform (a) servicing criterion 1122(d)(1)(v) is applicable only to the Company s Obligations related to the aggregation of information received and the conveyance of such information, in each case, as required by the transaction agreements; (b) servicing criteria 1122(d)(3)(i)(A),(B), and (D) are applicable only as they relate to the Company s responsibility to aggregate and provide loan-level data to the appropriate transaction party in accordance with the transaction agreements; (c) servicing criterion 1122(d)(3)(ii) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s Obligation to make remittances to various transaction parties in accordance with the timeframes set forth in the transaction agreements; and (d) servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only to the Company s Obligations related to the process of making or effecting an addition, removal or substitution to the asset pool in accordance with the transaction agreements (the Applicable Servicing Criteria ). 
 Third parties classified as vendors : With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company has engaged a vendor for certain transactions in the RMBS Master Servicing Platform to handle making payments to investors and/or third parties by check, and such vendor also safeguards any unissued checks. Management has determined that the vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Management elects to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the servicing criterion applicable to the vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation C DI 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers C DI 200.06 . The Company has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the activities of the vendor comply in all material respects with the servicing criterion applicable to the vendor. Management is solely responsible for determining that the Company meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and the related servicing criterion. 
 With respect to the RMBS Master Servicing Platform and the Period, Management provides the following assessment of the Company s compliance with respect to the Applicable Servicing Criteria: 
 1.	Management is responsible for assessing the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. 
 2.	Management has assessed the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including the servicing criteria for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 , as described above . In performing this assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB. 
 3. With respect to Applicable Servicing Criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii) and 1122(d)(2)(iii), Management has determined that there were no activities performed during the Period with respect to the RMBS Master Servicing Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. 
 4.	Based on such assessment for the Period, the Company has complied in all material respects with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period, except as described in Schedule A hereto.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to the Company s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

Schedule B- 22 

Schedule A 

Material Instance of Noncompliance by the Company 

Management s assessment of compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB for the Period, disclosed that a material instance of noncompliance occurred with respect to the servicing criterion set forth in Item 1122(d)(2)(v) as follows: 
 
 With respect to servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(v), custodial accounts for certain transactions on the RMBS Master Servicing Platform were not maintained at a federally insured depository institution as set forth in the transaction agreements because they did not satisfy account eligibility requirements. 

Servicing Criterion 1122(d)(2)(v) provides as follows: 
 Each custodial account is maintained at a federally insured depository institution as set forth in the transaction agreements. For purposes of this criterion, federally insured depository institution with respect to a foreign financial institution means a foreign financial institution that meets the requirements of 240.13k-1(b)(1) of this chapter. 

Schedule B hereto includes Management's discussion of the material instance of noncompliance, including remediation efforts currently being taken by the Company . 

Appendix A- 1 

Schedule B 
 
 Management s Discussion of the Material Instance of Noncompliance 
 1. 1122(d)(2)(v) Maintenance of Custodial Accounts : 

(a) General . The transaction agreements for the Company s RMBS Master Servicing Platform transactions require the institutions maintaining custodial accounts for each transaction to satisfy certain eligibility criteria. Generally, such eligibility criteria can be satisfied if the institution holding the account either (i) possesses requisite long and/or short-term credit ratings from the specified rating agency(ies) (collectively, the Requisite Ratings ), or (ii) satisfies one of the other alternative means of establishing account eligibility (collectively, Alternative Means ). With respect to certain custodial accounts that remained at Wells Fargo after Wells Fargo s sale of its Corporate Trust Services division to Computershare and during the Period, Management has determined that such custodial accounts were not maintained as set forth in the transaction agreements because (i) Wells Fargo s or Wells Fargo s holding company, as applicable, long and/or short-term issuer ratings during the Period were lower than the related Requisite Ratings thresholds for such transactions, and (ii) there was no Alternative Means during the Period to satisfy account eligibility requirements for such transactions. 

(b) Background . Management for the Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo disclosed account eligibility noncompliance as a material instance of noncompliance on its RMBS Master Servicing Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria for the 2019, 2020, and 2021 reporting periods. As of November 1, 2021, as part of the purchase of the Corporate Trust Services division from Wells Fargo, Computershare Trust Company, as Wells Fargo s agent, began performing the activities related to Item 1122(d)(2)(v) for its RMBS Master Servicing Platform transactions, which included the affected transactions with account eligibility noncompliance. As a result, Computershare Trust Company also disclosed the account eligibility noncompliance as a material instance of noncompliance on its RMBS Master Servicing Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria for the two month period of November 1, 2021 through and including December 31, 2021. 

(c) Current Scope . As of the end of the Period, Management has determined that approximately one quarter of the 1,449 RMBS Master Servicing Platform transactions listed on Appendix A to this 2022 Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria have account eligibility noncompliance. Each of the transactions with account eligibility noncompliance are part of the Company s Agent Role Transactions (as defined on the first page of this 2022 Assessment of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria). While the scope of account eligibility noncompliance is quantitatively material for the RMBS Master Servicing Platform, Management believes that the account eligibility noncompliance does not have a material impact on either (i) the Company s ability to master service the transactions in accordance with the transaction agreements, or (ii) the securities issued in connection with the related transactions or the investors holding such securities. 

(d) Remediation . With the purchase of the Corporate Trust Services division from Wells Fargo on November 1, 2021, the Company has taken responsibility for remediating RMBS Master Servicing Platform transactions with account eligibility noncompliance since it is performing the activities related to Item 1122(d)(2)(v). The Company intends to address the account eligibility noncompliance as part of its ongoing transition of the corporate trust business and may either move the affected accounts to banking institutions with Requisite Ratings or pursue Alternative Means to satisfy account eligibility requirements such as seeking a rating agency confirmation from relevant rating agencies. During the Period, the Company conveyed this intent to some of the trustees for some of the affected transactions in response to a status request.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 The Board of Directors Cenlar FSB: 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management Assessment, that Cenlar FSB (the Bank) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for the residential mortgage loans platform as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, except for servicing criteria 1122 (d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(b)-(c), 11 22(d)(4)(i)-(ii), and 1122(d)(4)(xi) which the Bank has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by them with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. See Appendix A of Management s Assessment for the asset backed transactions covered by this platform. Management is responsible for the Bank s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Bank s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Bank s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset backed transactions and securities that comprise the platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform and determining whether the Bank processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria and as permitted by Regulation AB Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations of the Division of Corporation Finance, Section 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Bank during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Bank during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Bank is responsible for assessing compliance with 1122(d)(2)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(iii), and 1122(d)(4)(xv) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by the Bank during the year ended December 31, 2022 that required these servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 We are required to be independent of Cenlar FSB and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our examination engagement. 
 Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Bank s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 As described in management s assertion, for servicing criterion 1122 (d)(2)(i), the Bank has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by this servicing criterion. The Bank has determined that these vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Bank has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criterion applicable to each vendor as permitted by C DI 200.06. As 
 
 A member firm of Ernst Young Global Limited 

permitted by C DI 200.06, the Bank has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Bank is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related criterion as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Bank s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that the Bank complied with the 
 aforementioned servicing criteria, including servicing criteria 1122 (d)(2)(i) for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the residential mortgage loans platform, is fairly stated, in all material respects.

 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Management s Assertion, that First Republic Bank (the Bank) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission s Regulation AB for residential mortgage loans serviced for others (the Platform), except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(C), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Bank has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform (the Servicing Criteria), as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Appendix A to Management s Assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible for the Bank s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assertion about the Bank s compliance with the Servicing Criteria based on our examination. 
 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to obtain reasonable assurance and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Bank s compliance with the Servicing Criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the Servicing Criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Bank during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Bank s compliance with the Servicing Criteria. 
 
 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to the examination engagement. 
 
 As described in the accompanying Management s Assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the Bank has engaged various vendors to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Bank has determined that none of these vendors is considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Bank has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by the SEC s Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation (C DI) 200.06, Vendors Engaged by Servicers (C DI 200.06). As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Bank has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor. The Bank is solely responsible for determining that it 
 
 meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendors and related servicing criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Bank s eligibility to apply C DI 200.06 
 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that First Republic Bank complied with the aforementioned Servicing Criteria, including servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii), for which compliance is determined based on C DI 200.06 as described above, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Management is responsible for the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria and its assertion. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertion about the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management's assertion about compliance with the servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the servicing activities related to the Platform, determining whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction included in the Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that the evidence we obtained in our examination is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 As described in management's assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i), 1122(d)(2)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), the Company has engaged a vendor to 
 
 perform certain activities required by this servicing criteria.

As permitted by C DI 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor's activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to this vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply C DI 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company's determination of its eligibility to apply C DI 200.06. 
 Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 In our opinion, management's assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, for the Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Audit Committee of Computershare Trust Company, National Association 
 We have examined management s assertion, included in the accompanying Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria: Computershare Corporate Trust - Document Custody Platform that Computershare Trust Company, National Association (the Company complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for the residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS transactions, commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS transactions, and other asset-backed securities ABS transactions, in each case for which the Company provides document custody services, either directly in the related role for such services or as the agent of the party performing such services, and for which either (a) some or all of the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were publicly offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the issued securities for such RMBS, CMBS, and ABS transactions were privately offered on or after January 1, 2006 pursuant to an exemption from registration and the Company (and/or the party for whom it acts as agent) has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government-sponsored entity, other than certain RMBS transactions for which the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (the Document Custody Platform ), as of December 31, 2022 and for the year then ended (the Period ), excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(i); 1122(d)(1)(iii); 1122(d)(1)(v); 1122(d)(2)(i-vii); 1122(d)(3)(i-iv); and 1122(d)(4)(iv-xv), which Management has determined are not applicable to either the Company s obligations, or the obligations of the party for whom the Company ultimately acts as agent, in either case under the related transaction agreements with respect to the Document Custody Platform for the Period (as applicable, the Company s Obligations ); provided however that, with respect to the Document Custody Platform (a) servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only as it relates to the Company s Obligation to review and maintain the required loan documents related to any additions, removals or substitutions in accordance with the transaction agreements. 
 As described in management's assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(ii), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to the vendor as permitted by Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules adopted under Regulation AB and the Securities Act and the Exchange Act Interpretation 200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor's activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to the vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as described in its 

assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company's determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06. 
 Appendix A to management's assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Document Custody Platform. 
 The Company s management is responsible for its assertion and for the Company's compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertion about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination. 
 Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management s assertion about compliance with the applicable servicing criteria is fairly stated, in all material respects, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Document Custody Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to the Document Custody Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement. 
 In our opinion, management s assertion that Computershare Trust Company, National Association complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended 
 December 31, 2022 for the Document Custody Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

As described in management's assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(vi), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by this servicing criterion. The Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to the vendor as permitted by Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 200.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance s interpretations of the rules adopted under Regulation AB and the Securities Act and the Exchange Act Interpretation 200.06 ). As permitted by Interpretation 200.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to the vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 200.06 for the vendor and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company's determination of its eligibility to use Interpretation 200.06. Appendix A to management's assertion identifies the individual asset-backed transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the RMBS Master Servicing Platform. Computershare Trust Company, National Association s management is responsible for the Company's compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's compliance with the applicable servicing criteria based on our examination. 

Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Company complied, in all material respects, with the applicable servicing criteria, and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the RMBS Master Servicing Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to the RMBS Master Servicing Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides, and that the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide, a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company s compliance with the servicing criteria. 
 We are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements related to the engagement. 
 Our examination disclosed the following material noncompliance with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(2)(v) of Regulation AB applicable to the Company during the period ended December 31, 2022. As required by Item 1122(d)(2)(v) of Regulation AB, each custodial account should be maintained at a federally insured depository institution as set forth in the transaction agreements. There are certain custodial accounts which were not maintained at a federally insured depository institution because they did not satisfy account eligibility requirements. 
 
 In our opinion, except for the material noncompliance described in the preceding paragraph, Computershare Trust Company, National Association complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the RMBS Master Servicing Platform, in all material respects.
