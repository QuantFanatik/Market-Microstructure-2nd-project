PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

BAB, Inc. the Company has three wholly owned subsidiaries: BAB Systems, Inc. Systems ), BAB Operations, Inc. Operations and BAB Investments, Inc. Investments ). Systems was incorporated on December 2, 1992, and was primarily established to franchise Big Apple Bagels BAB specialty bagel retail stores. My Favorite Muffin MFM was acquired in 1997 and is included as a part of Systems. Brewster s Brewster s was established in 1996 and the coffee is sold in BAB and MFM locations. SweetDuet SD frozen yogurt can be added as an additional brand in a BAB or MFM location. Operations was formed in 1995, primarily to operate Company-owned stores of which there are currently none. The assets of Jacobs Bros. Bagels Jacobs Bros. were acquired in 1999, and any branded wholesale business uses this trademark. Investments was incorporated in 2009 to be used for the purpose of acquisitions. To date there have been no acquisitions. 

The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 12, 2000. The Company currently franchises and licenses bagel and muffin retail units under the BAB, MFM and SD trade names. At November 30, 2022, the Company had 68 franchise units and 4 licensed units in operation in 20 states. There are 2 units under development. The Company's revenues are derived primarily from the ongoing royalties paid to the Company by its franchisees and from receipt of initial franchise fees. Additionally, the Company derives revenue from the sale of licensed products (My Favorite Muffin mix, Big Apple Bagels cream cheese and Brewster's coffee) to franchisees, licensees and other approved customers. 

The BAB franchised brand consists of units operating as Big Apple Bagels , featuring daily baked bagels, flavored cream cheeses, premium coffees, gourmet bagel sandwiches and other related products. BAB units are primarily concentrated in the Midwest and Western United States. The MFM brand consists of units operating as My Favorite Muffin Gourmet Muffin Bakery MFM Bakery ), featuring a large variety of freshly baked muffins and coffees and units operating as My Favorite Muffin Your All Day Bakery Caf MFM Cafe featuring these products as well as a variety of specialty bagel sandwiches and related products. The SweetDuet is a branded self-serve frozen yogurt that can be added as an additional brand in a BAB location. Although the Company doesn't actively market Brewster's stand-alone franchises, Brewster's coffee products are sold in most franchised units. 

The Company is leveraging on the natural synergy of distributing muffin products in existing BAB units and, alternatively, bagel products and Brewster's Coffee in existing MFM units. The Company expects to continue to realize efficiencies in servicing the combined base of BAB and MFM franchisees. 

Net Income 

 The Company reported net income of 432,000 for fiscal year ended November 30, 2022 and net income of 651,000 for fiscal year ended November 30, 2021. November 30, 2022 net operating income was 608,000 compared to 542,000 in 2021. 

Food Service Industry 

 Food service businesses are often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional, and local economic conditions; demographic trends; traffic patterns; and the type, number and location of competing restaurants. Multi-unit food service chains, such as the Company's, can also be substantially adversely affected by publicity resulting from problems with food quality, illness, injury or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one store or a limited number of stores. The food service business is also subject to the risk that shortages or interruptions in supply caused by adverse weather or other conditions could negatively affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients and other food products. In addition, factors such as inflation, increased food and labor costs, regional weather conditions, availability and cost of suitable sites and the availability of experienced management and hourly employees may also adversely affect the food service industry in general and the Company's results of operations and financial condition in particular.

A typical BAB store is in an area with a mix of both residential and commercial properties and ranges from 1,500 to 2,000 square feet. The Company's current store design is approximately 1,800 square feet, with seating capacity for 20 to 30 persons, and includes approximately 750 square feet devoted to production and baking. A satellite store is typically smaller than a production store, averaging 800 to 1,200 square feet. Although franchise stores may vary in size from other franchise stores, store layout is generally consistent.

They also serve gourmet coffees, beverages and, at MFM Cafe locations, a variety of bagels, bagel sandwiches and related products.

FRANCHISING 

The Company requires payment of an initial franchise fee per store, plus an ongoing 5 royalty on net sales. Additionally, BAB, MFM and SD franchisees are members of a marketing fund requiring an ongoing 3 contribution for general system-wide marketing. BAB currently requires a franchise fee of 25,000 on a franchisee's first full production BAB store. There is currently a 10,000 veterans discount for the franchise fee for the first location. The fee for subsequent production stores for BAB is 20,000. MFM currently requires a franchise fee of 30,000 on a franchisee's first full production MFM store. The fee for subsequent production stores for MFM is 25,000.

The Company's current Franchise Disclosure Documents FDD provides for, among other things, the opportunity for prospective franchisees to enter into a Preliminary Agreement for their first production store. This agreement enables a prospective franchisee a period of 60 days in which to locate a site. The fee for this Preliminary Agreement is 10,000. If a prospective franchisee fails to submit a site to Corporate in the designated timeframe, the preliminary agreement may be terminated and the fee is nonrefundable. If the prospective franchisee submits in writing, the request to terminate the agreement within the required timeframe, prior to submitting a site for approval Corporate will issue a refund of the preliminary fee less 3,000. If the prospective franchisee submits one site for approval that is not approved by Corporate, Corporate may, at its sole discretion either grant an extension to the above referenced 60 day period or terminate the Preliminary Agreement and refund the preliminary fee less 3,000. If a site is approved, the entire 10,000 will be applied toward the initial franchise fee. See also last paragraph under "Government Regulation" section in this 10-K. The Company's Franchise Agreement provides a franchisee with the right to develop one store at a specific location. Each Franchise Agreement is for a term of 10 years with the right to renew. Franchisees are expected to be in operation no later than 10 months following the signing of the Franchise Agreement. 

The Company currently advertises its franchising opportunities in directories, newspapers and the internet. In addition, prospective franchisees contact the Company as a result of patronizing an existing store. 

COMPETITION 

The quick service restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to product quality, concept, location, service and price. There are a number of national, regional and local chains operating both owned and franchised stores which compete with the Company on a national level or solely in a specific market or region. The Company believes that because the industry is extremely fragmented, there is a significant opportunity for expansion in the bagel, muffin and coffee concept chains. 

The Company believes the primary direct competitors of its bagel units are Panera Bread Company, Bruegger's Bagel Bakery and Einstein Bros. Bagels. There are several other regional bagel chains with fewer than 65 stores, as well as numerous small, independently owned bagel bakeries and national fast-food restaurants such as Dunkin and McDonald s, all of which may compete with the Company. There is no major national competitor in the muffin business, but there are a number of regional and local operators. Additionally, the Company competes directly with a number of national, regional and local coffee competitors. 

Other competition includes supermarket bakery sections and prepackaged, fresh and frozen bagels, muffins and yogurt. Certain of these competitors may have greater product and name recognition and larger financial, marketing and distribution capabilities than the Company. The Company believes the startup costs associated with opening a retail food establishment offering similar products on a stand-alone basis are competitive with the startup costs associated with opening its stores and, accordingly, such startup costs are not an impediment to entry into the retail bagel, muffin, frozen yogurt or coffee businesses. 

The Company believes that its stores compete favorably in terms of food quality, taste, convenience, customer service and value, which the Company believes are important factors to its targeted customers. Competition in the food service industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic and real estate conditions, demographic trends, traffic patterns, the cost and availability of labor, consumer purchasing power, availability of product and local competitive factors. The Company attempts to manage or adapt to these factors, but not all such factors are within the Company's control. Such factors could cause the Company and some or all of its franchisees to be adversely affected. 

The Company competes for qualified franchisees with a wide variety of investment opportunities in the restaurant business, as well as other industries. Investment opportunities in the bagel bakery cafe business include franchises offered by Einstein Bros. Bagels, Bruegger's Bagel Bakery and Panera Bread Company. The Company's continued success is dependent on its reputation for providing high quality and value with respect to its service, products and franchises. This reputation is affected by the performance of its franchise stores and licensed units that sell branded products over which the Company has limited control.

TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS 

The trademarks, trade names and service marks used by the Company contain common descriptive English words and thus may be subject to challenge by users of these words, alone or in combination with other words, to describe other services or products. Some persons or entities may have prior rights to these names or marks in their respective localities. Accordingly, there is no assurance that such names and marks are available in all locations. Any challenge, if successful, in whole or in part, could restrict the Company's use of the names and marks in areas in which the challenger is found to have used the name or mark prior to the Company's use. Any such restriction could limit the expansion of the Company's use of the names or marks into that region, and the Company and its franchisees may be materially and adversely affected. 

The trademarks and service marks "Big Apple Bagels ," "My Favorite Muffin ," SweetDuet and "Brewster's Coffee" are registered under applicable federal trademark law. The MFM brand consists of units operating as My Favorite Muffin Gourmet Muffin Bakery MFM Bakery ), featuring a large variety of freshly baked muffins and coffees and units operating as My Favorite Muffin Your All Day Bakery Caf MFM Cafe featuring these products as well as a variety of specialty bagel sandwiches and related products. These marks are licensed by the Company to its franchisees pursuant to Franchise Agreements. In February 1999, the Company acquired the trademark of "Jacobs Bros. Bagels " upon purchasing certain assets of Jacobs Bros. The "Jacobs Bros. Bagels " mark is also registered under applicable federal trademark law. 

The Company is aware of the use by other persons and entities in certain geographic areas of names and marks which are the same as, or similar to, the Company's names and marks. Some of these persons or entities may have prior rights to those names or marks in their respective localities; therefore, there is no assurance that the names and marks are available in all locations. It is the Company's policy to pursue registration of its names and marks whenever possible and to vigorously oppose any infringement of its names and marks. 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

The Company is subject to the Trade Regulation Rule of the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") entitled Disclosure Requirements and Prohibitions Concerning Franchising'' (the "Amended FTC Franchise Rule") and state and local laws and regulations that govern the offer, sale and termination of franchises and the refusal to renew franchises. Continued compliance with these broad federal, state and local regulatory networks is essential and costly. The failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on the Company and its franchisees. Violations of franchising laws and/or state laws and regulations regulating substantive aspects of doing business in a particular state could limit the Company's ability to sell franchises or subject the Company and its affiliates to rescission offers, monetary damages, penalties, imprisonment and/or injunctive proceedings. In addition, under court decisions in certain states, absolute vicarious liability may be imposed upon franchisors based upon claims made against franchisees. Even if the Company is able to obtain insurance coverage for such claims, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be sufficient to cover potential claims against the Company. 

The Company and its franchisees are required to comply with federal, state and local government regulations applicable to consumer food service businesses, including those relating to the preparation and sale of food, minimum wage requirements, overtime, working and safety conditions, citizenship requirements, as well as regulations relating to zoning, construction, health and business licensing. Each store is subject to regulation by federal agencies and to licensing and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, safety, fire and other departments. Difficulties or failures in obtaining the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new Company-owned or franchise store, and failure to remain in compliance with applicable regulations could cause the temporary or permanent closing of an existing store. The Company believes that it is in material compliance with these provisions. Continued compliance with these federal, state and local laws and regulations is costly but essential, and failure to comply may have an adverse effect on the Company and its franchisees. 

The Company's franchising operations are subject to regulation by the FTC under the Amended FTC Franchise Rule which requires, among other things, that the Company prepare and periodically update a comprehensive disclosure document known as a Franchise Disclosure Document FDD in connection with the sale and operation of its franchises. In addition, some states require a franchisor to register its franchise with the state before it may offer a franchise to a prospective franchisee. The Company believes its FDDs, together with any applicable state versions or supplements, comply with both the FTC guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which it has offered franchises. 

- 6 -

The Company is also subject to a number of state laws, as well as foreign laws (to the extent it offers franchises outside of the United States), that regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship, including, but not limited to, those concerning termination and non-renewal of a franchise. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of November 30, 2022, the Company employed 12 full time persons in the Corporate headquarters. The employees are responsible for corporate management and oversight, franchising, accounting, advertising and operations.

On May 6, 2013, the Board of Directors Board of BAB, Inc. authorized and declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of the common stock of BAB, Inc. to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 13, 2013. Each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of the Series A Participating Preferred Stock of the Company at an exercise price of 0.90 per one-thousandth of a Preferred Share, subject to adjustment. The complete terms of the Rights are set forth in a Preferred Shares Rights Agreement, dated May 6, 2013, between the Company and IST Shareholder Services, as rights agent.

The Board adopted the Rights Agreement to protect stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics. In general terms, it works by imposing a significant penalty upon any person or group that acquires 15 (or 20 in the case of certain institutional investors who report their holdings on Schedule 13G) or more of the Common Shares without the approval of the Board. As a result, the overall effect of the Rights Agreement and the issuance of the Rights may be to render more difficult a merger, tender or exchange offer or other business combination involving the Company that is not approved by the Board. However, neither the Rights Agreement nor the Rights should interfere with any merger, tender or exchange offer or other business combination approved by the Board. 

Full details about the Rights Plan are contained in a Form 8-K filed by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on May 7, 2013. 

On June 18, 2014 an amendment to the Preferred Shares Rights Agreement was filed appointing American Stock Transfer Trust Company, LLC as successor to Illinois Stock Transfer Company. All original rights and provisions remain unchanged. On August 18, 2015 an amendment was filed to the Preferred Shares Rights Agreement changing the final expiration date to mean the fifth anniversary of the date of the original agreement. All other original rights and provisions remain the same. On May 22, 2017 an amendment was filed extending the final expiration date to mean the seventh anniversary date of the original agreement. All other original rights and provisions remain the same. On February 22, 2019 an amendment was filed extending the final expiration date to mean the ninth anniversary date of the original agreement. All other original rights and provisions remain the same. On March 4, 2021 an amendment was filed extending the final expiration date to mean the eleventh anniversary date of the original agreement. All other original rights and provisions remain the same. 

Determination of whether distributions are considered a cash distribution, cash dividend or combination of the two are not made until after December 31, 2022, as the classification or combination is dependent upon the Company s earnings and profits for tax purposes for its fiscal year ending November 30, 2022. 

The Company believes execution of its cash distribution/dividend policy will not have any material adverse effects on its ability to fund current operations or future capital investments.

GENERAL 

The Company has 68 franchised and 4 licensed units with 2 units under development at the end of 2022. Units in operation and under development at the end of 2021 included 68 franchised and 4 licensed units and 3 units under development. System-wide revenues were 38.2 million in 2022 and 35.0 million in 2021. 

The Company's revenues are derived primarily from the ongoing royalties paid to the Company by its franchisees and from receipt of initial franchise fees. Additionally, the Company derives revenue from the sale of licensed products (My Favorite Muffin mix, Big Apple Bagels cream cheese and Brewster's coffee) to franchisees, licensees and other approved customers. 

YEAR 2022 COMPARED TO YEAR 2021 

Total revenues from all sources increased 215,000, or 7.0 , to 3,287,000 in 2022 from 3,072,000 in the prior year. Marketing revenue increased 100,000 in 2022 compared to 2021, franchise fee revenue increased 4,000 in 2022 versus 2021, royalty revenue increased 159,000 and licensing and other revenue decreased 49,000 in 2022 compared to 2021. 

Royalty fee revenue of 1,838,000, for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2022, increased 159,000, or 9.5 , from the 1,679,000 for fiscal year ended November 30, 2021. The increase in royalties for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2022 was primarily due to franchisees continued increase in usage of online ordering and delivery services in their areas, combined with the fact that COVID-19 still had some impact on restaurant patronage during early fiscal 2021. In addition, many franchisees during fiscal 2022 raised prices as was common in the restaurant industry. 

Franchise fee revenue increased 4,000, or 8.2 , to 53,000 in 2022 as compared to 49,000 in 2021. In 2022 there were five transfers, one store closed that had not been fully amortized resulting in 5,000 in franchise fees recognized and one store opened resulting in 6,000 in franchise fee in addition to the normal monthly amortization. In 2021 there were four transfers, one store closed that had not been fully amortized resulting in 12,000 of franchise fees recognized in addition to normal monthly amortization. 

Licensing fees and other income decreased 49,000, or 13.5 , to 314,000 in 2022 compared to 363,000 in 2021. Marketing fund revenues increased 100,000, or 10.2 to 1,081,00 in 2022 compared to 981,000 in 2021. 

Total operating expenses in 2022 were 2,679,000, or 81.5 of revenues, compared to 2,530,000, or 82.4 of revenues in 2021. Total operating expenses in 2022 increased 149,000, or 5.9 , compared to 2021. 

The increase in operating expenses of 149,000, or 5.9 in 2022 was primarily due to an increase in marketing expenses of 100,000, employee benefit expenses increased 12,000, professional fee expense increased 11,000, travel expenses increased 6,000 and other expenses increased 28,000 compared to 2021. These were offset by a decrease in advertising and promotion expense of 8,000 in fiscal 2022 compared to the same period 2021. 

Interest income was less than 1,000 in 2022 and 2021. 

In 2022 there was an income tax expense of 176,000 which includes 117,000 of noncash deferred tax expense, 37,000 of federal income tax, which was net of an NOL carryover and 22,000 of state taxes. There was an income tax expense in 2021 of 119,000 which includes 79,000 of noncash deferred tax expense and 40,000 of state income tax expense. There were no 2021 federal income taxes because of utilization of NOL carryforwards. There was net income of 432,000 in 2022 versus a net income of 651,000, including the non-taxable Payroll Protection Loan forgiveness of 228,000 in 2021. 

Total operating income before interest and taxes was 608,000 in 2022 or 18.5 of revenue as compared to 542,000 or 17.6 of revenue in the prior year. In 2022 and 2021 earnings per share for basic and diluted outstanding shares was 0.06 and 0.09, respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

At November 30. 2022, the Company had working capital of 1,386,000 and unrestricted cash of 1,623,000. At November 30, 2021, the Company had working capital of 1,166,000 and unrestricted cash of 1,462,000. 

During fiscal 2022, the Company had net income of 432,000 and operating activities which provided cash of 135,000. The principal adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities were depreciation and amortization of 4,000, deferred tax expense of 118,000 and noncash lease expense of 99,000, less the recovery of uncollectible accounts of 1,000 and 5,000 in sales-type lease income. In addition, changes in other operating assets and liabilities decreased cash a total of 512,000. During fiscal 2021, the Company had net income of 651,000 and operating activities which provided cash of 718,000. The principal adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities were depreciation and amortization of 5,000, deferred tax expense of 79,000 and noncash lease expense of 99,000, less the recovery of uncollectible accounts of 3,000. In addition, changes in other operating assets and liabilities increased cash a total of 115,000. 

During fiscal 2022, the Company used no funds for investing activities and during fiscal 2021, the Company used 3,000 for investing activities for equipment purchases and trademark renewals. 

Financing activities in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 included cash used for distributions/dividend payments to common stockholders of 291,000. 

Although there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to pay cash distributions/dividends in the future, it is the Company s intent that future cash distributions/dividends will be considered based on profitability expectations and financing needs and will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors. It is the Company s intent going forward to declare and pay cash distributions/dividends on a quarterly basis if warranted. 

Determination of whether distributions are considered a cash distribution, cash dividend or combination of the two will not be made until after December 31, 2022, as the classification or combination is dependent upon the Company s earnings and profits for tax purposes for its fiscal year ending November 30, 2022. 

The Company believes execution of its cash distribution/dividend policy will not have any material adverse effects on its ability to fund current operations or future capital investments. 

The Company was granted a PPP loan in May 2020 in the amount 228,155. The loan was forgiven through the SBA on December 8, 2020 and is reflected in other income in fiscal year 2021. 

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The Company's significant accounting policies are presented in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 2 of the audited consolidated financial statements included herein). While all of the significant accounting policies impact the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, some of the policies may be viewed to be more critical. The more critical policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and that require management's most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments and estimates. Management bases its judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of judgments and estimates form the basis for making judgments about the Company's value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following are its most critical accounting policies because they require more significant judgments and estimates in preparation of its consolidated financial statements. 

Long-Lived Assets 

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Improvements and replacements are capitalized, while expenditures for maintenance and routine repairs that do not extend the life of the asset are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Estimated useful lives for the purpose of depreciation and amortization are 3 to 7 years for property and equipment and 10 years, or the term of the lease if less, for leasehold improvements. 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Accounting Standard Codification ASC 350 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets requires that assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized, but instead be subject to annual impairment tests. The Company follows this guidance. 

Following the guidelines contained in ASC 350, the Company tests goodwill and intangible assets that are not subject to amortization for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that impairment is possible. The Company has elected to conduct its annual test during the first quarter. During the quarters ended February 28, 2022 and 2021, management qualitatively assessed goodwill to determine whether testing was necessary. Factors that management considers in this assessment include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance (both current and projected), changes in management and strategy, and changes in the composition and carrying amounts of net assets. If this qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than it s carrying value, a quantitative assessment is then performed. 

Although the Covid-19 Pandemic caused significant disruption to our industry, the Company has returned to growth of royalty revenues. For the twelve months ended November 30, 2022 royalty revenues were up 9.4 from same period 2021 and 11.7 from the same period 2019 (pre-pandemic). Management reviewed and updated the qualitative assessment conducted during the first quarter 2022 at year end and does not believe that any impairment exists at November 30, 2022. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk 

Certain financial instruments potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk. These financial instruments consist primarily of royalty and wholesale accounts receivables. The Company believes it has maintained adequate reserves for doubtful accounts. The Company reviews the collectability of receivables periodically taking into account payment history and industry conditions. 

Deferred Taxes 

The Company routinely reviews the future realization of tax assets based on projected future reversals of taxable temporary differences, available tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income. As of November 30, 2022 the company no longer had net operating loss carryforwards where at November 30, 2021 the company had net operating loss carryforwards which will be utilized of approximately 160,000 on the fiscal year 2022 tax returns filed in 2023.

Lease Receivables Commitments 

The Company leases restaurant equipment to a certain franchise under a sales-type lease agreement. The lease agreement does not contain any non-lease components. The lease term is for a period of seven years, beginning June 1, 2022 and ending June 1, 2029. The lease requires weekly payments of 121 for a total 365 payments, and a final optional buy-out payment of 4,800, which management believes estimates residual value. At November 30, 2022, management does not believe the unguaranteed residual asset value of 4,800 to be impaired. 

During the period ended November 30, 2022, the Company recorded revenue from the sale of the lease of 5,319. The income is included in Licensing fees and other income on the Consolidated Statements of Income for fiscal 2022. The Company also recorded interest income from the lease of 256. 

The sales lease is included in the balance sheet at the current value of the lease payments at a 1.25 discount rate, which reflects the rate implicit in the lease agreement. 

Leases 

The Company accounts for leases under ASC 842. Lease arrangements are determined at the inception of the contract. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use ROU assets, other current liabilities and long-term operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 

Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

Franchise and related revenue 

The Company sells individual franchises. The franchise agreements typically require the franchisee to pay an initial, non-refundable fee prior to opening the respective location(s), and continuing royalty fees on a weekly basis based upon a percentage of franchisee net sales. The initial term of franchise agreements are typically 10 years. Subject to the Company s approval, a franchisee may generally renew the franchise agreement upon its expiration. If approved, a franchisee may transfer a franchise agreement to a new or existing franchisee, at which point a transfer fee is typically paid by the current owner which then terminates that franchise agreement. A franchise agreement is signed with the new franchisee with no franchise fee required. If a contract is terminated prior to its term, it is a breach of contract and a penalty is assessed based on a formula reviewed and approved by management. Revenue generated from a contract breach is termed settlement income by the Company and included in licensing fees and other income. 

Under the terms of our franchise agreements, the Company typically promises to provide franchise rights, pre-opening services such as blueprints, operational materials, planning and functional training courses, and ongoing services, such as management of the marketing fund. The Company considers certain pre-opening activities and the franchise rights and related ongoing services represent two separate performance obligations. The franchise fee revenue has been allocated to the two separate performance obligations using a residual approach. The Company has estimated the value of performance obligations related to certain pre-opening activities deemed to be distinct based on cost plus an applicable margin, and assigned the remaining amount of the initial franchise fee to the franchise rights and ongoing services. Revenue allocated to preopening activities is recognized when (or as) these services are performed. Revenue allocated to franchise rights and ongoing services is deferred until the store opens, and recognized on a straight-line basis over the duration of the agreement, as this ensures that revenue recognition aligns with the customer s access to the franchise right. 

- 13 -

Franchise and related revenue continued) 

Royalty fees from franchised stores represent a 5 fee on net retail and wholesale sales of franchised units. Royalty revenues are recognized on an accrual basis using actual franchise receipts. Generally, franchisees report and remit royalties on a weekly basis. The majority of month-end receipts are recorded on an accrual basis based on actual numbers from reports received from franchisees shortly after the month-end. Estimates are utilized in certain instances where actual numbers have not been received and such estimates are based on the average of the last 10 weeks actual reported sales. 

Royalty income is recognized during the respective franchise agreement based on the royalties earned each period as the underlying franchise store sales occur. 

There are two items involving revenue recognition of contracts that require us to make subjective judgments: the determination of which performance obligations are distinct within the context of the overall contract and the estimated stand-alone selling price of each obligation. In instances where our contract includes significant customization or modification services, the customization and modification services are generally combined and recorded as one distinct performance obligation. 

Nontraditional and rebate revenue 

As part of the Company s franchise agreements, the franchisee purchases products and supplies from designated vendors. The Company may receive various fees and rebates from the vendors and distributors on product purchases by franchisees. In addition, the Company may collect various initial fees, and those fees are classified as deferred revenue in the balance sheet and straight lined over the life of the contract as deferred revenue in the balance sheet. The Company does not possess control of the products prior to their transfer to the franchisee and products are delivered to franchisees directly from the vendor or their distributors. The Company recognizes the rebates as franchisees purchase products and supplies from vendors or distributors and recognizes the initial fees over the contract life and the fees are reported as licensing fees and other income in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Gift card breakage revenue 

The Company sells gift cards to its customers in its retail stores and through its Corporate office. The Company s gift cards do not have an expiration date and are not redeemable for cash except where required by law. Revenue from gift cards is recognized upon redemption in exchange for product and reported within franchisee store revenue and the royalty and marketing fees are paid and shown in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Until redemption, outstanding customer balances are recorded as a liability. An obligation is recorded at the time of sale of the gift card and it is included in accrued expenses on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses at November 30, 2022 and 2021 were liabilities of 239,000 and 210,000, respectively for unredeemed gift cards. 

The liability is reduced when the gift cards are redeemed by a franchise. Although there are no expiration dates for our gift cards, based on our analysis of historical gift card redemption patterns, we can reasonably estimate the amount of gift cards for which redemption is remote, which is referred to as breakage. The Company recognizes gift card breakage proportional to actual gift card redemptions on a quarterly basis and the corresponding revenue is included in licensing fees and other revenue. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the breakage rate and will be reassessed each quarter.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The standard s main goal is to improve financial reporting by requiring earlier recognition of credit losses on financing receivables and other financial assets in scope, including trade receivables. The amendments in this update broaden the information that an entity must consider in developing its expected credit loss estimate for assets measured either collectively or individually. The guidance in ASU 2016-13 is effective for public companies for fiscal years and for interim periods with those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-13 for fiscal year ending November 30, 2025 and the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have any material impact on the Company s financial position, cash flows or results of operations. 

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. The amendments in ASU 2019-12 are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods therein. Early adoption of the standard is permitted, including adoption in interim or annual periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The Company will adopt ASU 2019-12 for fiscal year ending November 30, 2025 and the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have any material impact on the Company s financial position, cash flows or results of operations. 

Management does not believe that there are any recently issued and effective or not yet effective accounting pronouncements as of November 30, 2022 that would have or are expected to have any significant effect on the Company s financial position, cash flows or income statement.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and 
Stockholders of BAB, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BAB, Inc. (the Company) as of November 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended November 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of November 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended November 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Valuation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets 

At November 30, 2022, the Company s goodwill was 1,493,771 and indefinite-lived intangible assets were 461,445. As disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment either qualitatively or quantitively at least annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment require the performance of interim impairment assessment. During the year ended November 30, 2022, management qualitatively assessed goodwill to determine whether additional quantitative testing was necessary. 

Auditing the accounting for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets was highly judgmental due to the qualitative nature of the goodwill impairment evaluation, and the subjectivity in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than the carrying amount. 

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included obtaining an understanding and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s process of accounting for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, and evaluating events and circumstances identified by management to support an assertion that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Relevant events and circumstances evaluated included general macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions in which the Company operates, changes in cost factors, overall financial performance, including both actual and expected performance, entity-specific events, changes in share price, both in absolute terms and relative to peers, and any applicable quantitative analysis used to support qualitative discussions.

Note 1 - Nature of Operations 

BAB, Inc the Company has three wholly owned subsidiaries: BAB Systems, Inc. Systems and BAB Operations, Inc. Operations and BAB Investments, Inc. Investments ). Systems was incorporated on December 2, 1992, and was primarily established to franchise Big Apple Bagels BAB specialty bagel retail stores. My Favorite Muffin MFM was acquired in 1997 and is included as a part of Systems. Brewster s Brewster s was established in 1996 and the coffee is sold in BAB and MFM locations. SweetDuet SD frozen yogurt can be added as an additional brand in a BAB or MFM location. Operations was formed in 1995, primarily to operate Company-owned stores of which there are currently none. The assets of Jacobs Bros. Bagels Jacobs Bros. were acquired in 1999, and any branded wholesale business uses this trademark. Investments was incorporated in 2009 to be used for the purpose of acquisitions. To date there have been no acquisitions. 

The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 12, 2000. The Company currently franchises and licenses bagel and muffin retail units under the BAB, MFM and SD trade names. At November 30, 2022, the Company had franchise units and licensed units in operation in states. There are units under development. The Company's revenues are derived primarily from the ongoing royalties paid to the Company by its franchisees and from receipt of initial franchise fees. Additionally, the Company derives revenue from the sale of licensed products (My Favorite Muffin mix, Big Apple Bagels cream cheese and Brewster's coffee) to franchisees, licensees and other approved customers. 

The BAB franchised brand consists of units operating as Big Apple Bagels , featuring daily baked bagels, flavored cream cheeses, premium coffees, gourmet bagel sandwiches and other related products. BAB units are primarily concentrated in the Midwest and Western United States. The MFM brand consists of units operating as My Favorite Muffin Gourmet Muffin Bakery MFM Bakery ), featuring a large variety of freshly baked muffins and coffees and units operating as My Favorite Muffin Your All Day Bakery Caf MFM Cafe featuring these products as well as a variety of specialty bagel sandwiches and related products. The SweetDuet is a branded self-serve frozen yogurt that can be added as an additional brand in a BAB location. Although the Company doesn't actively market Brewster's stand-alone franchises, Brewster's coffee products are sold in most franchised units. 

The Company is leveraging on the natural synergy of distributing muffin products in existing BAB units and, alternatively, bagel products and Brewster's Coffee in existing MFM units. The Company expects to continue to realize efficiencies in servicing the combined base of BAB and MFM franchisees.

On May 6, 2013 , the Board of Directors Board of BAB, Inc. authorized and declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of the common stock of BAB, Inc. to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 13, 2013 . Each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of the Series A Participating Preferred Stock of the Company at an exercise price of per one thousandth of a Preferred Share, subject to adjustment. The complete terms of the Rights are set forth in a Preferred Shares Rights Agreement, dated May 6, 2013 , between the Company and IST Shareholder Services, as rights agent. 

The Board adopted the Rights Agreement to protect stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics. In general terms, it works by imposing a significant penalty upon any person or group that acquires (or in the case of certain institutional investors who report their holdings on Schedule 13G) or more of the Common Shares without the approval of the Board. As a result, the overall effect of the Rights Agreement and the issuance of the Rights may be to render more difficult a merger, tender or exchange offer or other business combination involving the Company that is not approved by the Board. However, neither the Rights Agreement nor the Rights should interfere with any merger, tender or exchange offer or other business combination approved by the Board. 

Full details about the Rights Plan are contained in a Form 8-K filed by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on May 7, 2013.

On August 18, 2015 an amendment was filed to the Preferred Shares Rights Agreement changing the final expiration date to mean the fifth anniversary of the date of the original agreement. All other original rights and provisions remain the same. On May 22, 2017 an amendment was filed extending the final expiration date to mean the seventh anniversary date of the original agreement. All other original rights and provisions remain the same. On February 22, 2019 an amendment was filed extending the final expiration date to mean the ninth anniversary date of the original agreement. All other original rights and provisions remain the same. On March 4, 2021 an amendment was filed extending the final expiration date to mean the eleventh anniversary date of the original agreement. All other original rights and provisions remain the same. 

Determination of whether distributions are considered a cash distribution, cash dividend or combination of the two will not be made until after December 31, 2022, as the classification or combination is dependent upon the Company s earnings and profits for tax purposes for its fiscal year ending November 30, 2022.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers 

The Company's Certificate of Incorporation limits personal liability for breach of fiduciary duty by its directors to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "Delaware Law"). Such Certificate eliminates the personal liability of directors to the Company and its shareholders for damages occasioned by breach of fiduciary duty, except for liability based on breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the Company, liability for acts or omissions not made in good faith, liability for acts or omissions involving intentional misconduct, liability based on payments or improper dividends, liability based on violation of state securities laws, and liability for acts occurring prior to the date such provision was added. Any amendment to or repeal of such provisions in the Company's Certificate of Incorporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Company for with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. 

In addition to the Delaware Law, the Company's Bylaws provide that officers and directors of the Company have the right to indemnification from the Company for liability arising out of certain actions to the fullest extent permissible by law. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling the Company pursuant to such indemnification provisions, the Company has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is therefore unenforceable.
