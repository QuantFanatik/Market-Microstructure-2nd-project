to our ability to consummate any acquisition or other business combination and any other statements that are not statements of current
or historical facts. These statements are based on management s current expectations, but actual results may differ materially due
to various factors, including, but not limited to:

our success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or directors following our initial business combination; 

our officers and directors allocating their time to other businesses and potentially having conflicts of interest with our business or in approving our initial business combination, as a result of which they would then receive expense reimbursements;

the ability of our officers and directors to generate a number of potential acquisition opportunities; 

our pool of prospective target businesses; 

the ability of our officers and directors to generate a number of potential acquisition opportunities;

ii 

The forward-looking statements
contained in this Report are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects
on us. Future developments affecting us may not be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of
risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially
different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize,
or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking
statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.

PART I 

Item 1. Business. 

Overview 

We are a blank check company
incorporated on August 20, 2020, in the Cayman Islands for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination. Since our initial
public offering (as described below), we have focused our search for an initial business combination on businesses that may provide significant
opportunities for attractive investor returns. 

Initial Public Offering 

On November 12, 2020, we consummated
our initial public offering of 9,000,000 units. Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, one right and one redeemable warrant
of the Company, with each right entitling the holder thereof to receive one-tenth of one Class A ordinary share upon the consummation
of an initial business combination, and with each warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one-half of one Class A ordinary share
for 11.50 per whole share. The units were sold at a price of 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of 90,000,000. 

Simultaneously with the closing
of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 479,000 units, 414,000 of which were sold to our sponsor
and 65,000 of which were sold to I-Bankers, at a purchase price of 10.00 per private placement unit, generating gross proceeds of 4,790,000. 

A total of 91,530,000 from
the net proceeds from the initial public offering and the private placement units was placed in the trust account maintained by Continental,
acting as trustee. 

Our management team is led
by Kevin Chen, our Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, and Bob Ai, our Chief Financial Officer and Director,
who collectively have expertise in nearly all facets of the healthcare sector and strong expertise in investment management. Christine
Zhao served as our Chief Financial Officer and a Director of the Company from September 2020 to October 2022. 

We must complete our initial
business combination by February 12, 2023. If our initial business combination is not consummated by February 12, 2023 and we do not obtain
a further extension of time from our shareholders, then our existence will terminate, and we will distribute all amounts in the trust
account. 

Termination of the Calidi Merger Agreement 

On February 2, 2022, the Company
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Edoc Merger Sub Inc, and Calidi Biotherapeutics, Inc. On August 11, 2022, the Company
received written notice that Calidi Biotherapeutics, Inc. had terminated the Merger Agreement. As a result of the termination of the Merger
Agreement, the Merger Agreement was of no further force and effect, and certain agreements entered into in connection with the Merger
Agreement, including but not limited to, the Voting Agreement and Lock-Up Agreement, were no longer in force or effect.

Our Business 

Exempted companies are Cayman
Islands companies wishing to conduct business outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions
of the Companies Law. As an exempted company, we have applied for and received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government
that, in accordance with section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from
the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or
appreciations shall apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations
or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other
obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital
by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us. 

We believe the health care
sector has experienced a significant amount of change over the last several years. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and
the ultimate impact on the healthcare sector remains uncertain and difficult to predict. Health system capacity may be subject to possible
increased volatility due to the pandemic from time to time. However, we believe that these challenges may also lead to meaningful acquisition
opportunities, such as the AOI Merger. In addition, we see long-term catalyst in accelerating the broader adoption of telemedicine. 

We have employed a pro-active acquisition
strategy focused on identifying potential business combination targets in the healthcare sector, as seen with the AOI Merger. Possible
targets have included hospitals or hospital networks, specialty clinics chain, chronic disease health care service providers, telemedicine/digital
health providers and/or associated technology/platform enablers, or artificial intelligence/big data enabled diagnostic providers. We
believe strongly in our management team s ability to add value from both an operating and a financing perspective which has been
a key driver of past performance and we believe will continue to be central to its differentiated acquisition strategy. 

Business Strategy 

We seek to create compelling
shareholder value by leveraging the track record, strong network, and complementary experience of our management team and sponsor affiliate,
which includes experts in nearly all facets of the healthcare sector and strong expertise in investment management. 

Our sponsor s members,
affiliates and contacts Affiliated Physicians comprise a significant network of physicians in the United States, Canada,
and Europe with ties to the Asia-Pacific region. 38 of our sponsor s members are physicians. Our sponsor s relationship
with the Society of Chinese American Physician Entrepreneurs SCAPE (approximately 445 physicians) and the World Association
of Chinese Doctors WACD (over 20,000 physicians), represents a significant opportunity to source target business combinations
and business relationships. Through our sponsor, SCAPE, and WACD, among other relationships, our member and affiliated physicians represent
over 30 specialty fields of medicine, and represent practices located throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand,
the People s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and elsewhere. 

8 

Our Affiliated Physicians
are employed by, have practice privileges, or other affiliations or appointments with leading medical institutions including the Mayo
Clinic, the Cleveland Clinic, New York Presbyterian, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital,
Kaiser Permanente, UCLA Medical Center, UCSF Medical Center, Stanford University, and Duke University. 

Our Sponsor entered into an
agreement in accordance with the guidelines of Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, to place limit orders, through ED F Man Capital
Markets Inc., an independent broker-dealer registered under Section 15 of the Exchange Act which is not affiliated with us nor part
of the underwriting or selling group, to purchase an aggregate of up to 3,750,000 of our rights in the open market at market prices, and
not to exceed 0.20 per right during the period commencing on the later of (i) December 10, 2020, the date separate trading of the rights
commenced or (ii) sixty calendar days after the end of the restricted period under Regulation M, continuing until the date
that was the earlier of (a) November 9, 2021 and (b) the date that we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement in connection
with our initial business combination, or earlier in certain circumstances as described in the limit order agreement. The limit orders
required such members of our sponsor to purchase any rights offered for sale (and not purchased by another investor) at or below a price
of 0.20, until the earlier of (x) the expiration of the buyback period or (y) the date such purchases reach 3,750,000 rights in total.
Our sponsor would not have any discretion or influence with respect to such purchases and will not be able to sell or transfer any rights
purchased in the open market pursuant to such agreements until following the consummation of a business combination. It was intended that
the broker s purchase obligation would be subject to applicable law, including Regulation M under the Exchange Act, which may prohibit
or limit purchases pursuant to the limit order agreement in certain circumstances. I-Bankers also agreed to purchase up to 1,250,000
of our rights in the open market at market prices not to exceed 0.20 per right, on substantially similar terms as our sponsor. The obligations
to make any such purchases expired on November 9, 2021, without any limit orders having been placed by our sponsor or I-Bankers. 

Market Opportunity 

Although we are not limited
to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating an initial business combination, we are focusing on businesses
within the healthcare space in Asia-Pacific and North America with an overall transaction value between 300 million and 1.0 billion. 

We believe the healthcare
sector is well poised for strong growth over the long-term given aging demographic trends. Population growth, combined with increased
economic power and efforts to expand public health systems, will likely result in higher health care spending. As care deferrals are reduced
when the pandemic subsides the sector represents short-term attractive target markets given the size, breadth and prospects for growth. 

According to Deloitte Insights
2020 Global Healthcare Outlook 

Health care spending is expected to rise at a CAGR of 5 over 2019 2023, up from 2.7 in 2014 2018 and 

Global health care spending as a share of GDP will likely remain at around 10.2 through 2023, equal to 2018 s ratio. 

According to Global
Telemedicine Market Report 2022 2027, by 2027, the global telemedicine services is expected to reach 210 billion. The
Global MD 2022 State of Telemedicine Report says that the percentage of patients who participated in a telemedicine visit increased
from 42 in 2020 to 67 in 2021. to the Global MD 2022 State of Telemedicine Report, The percentage of patients who participated in
a telemedicine visit increased from 42 in 2020 to 67 in 2021.to the Global MD 2022 State of Telemedicine Report, The percentage of
patients who participated in a telemedicine visit increased from 42 in 2020 to 67 in 2021. to the Global MD 2022 State of
Telemedicine Report, The percentage of patients who participated in a telemedicine visit increased from 42 in 2020 to 67 in
2021. 

9 

The COVID-19 pandemic
has further accelerated digital adoption due to COVID-19 related quarantine and stay-at-home measures, need for social distancing,
with telemedicine spending and usage expected to increase significantly from pre-COVID levels. 

Strong Healthcare growth opportunities
in Asia There has been a significant gap in healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP and healthcare service quality, creating
what we believe to be a large degree of room for spending increases and enhancements in service standards in Asia. 

Asian countries will likely
contribute around half of global growth in high income households (Deloitte insights 2020 Global Healthcare Outlook). 

We have not narrowed our business
combination target to any particular healthcare business; however, we are exploring the following potential markets: 

Telemedicine/digital health providers and/or associated technology/platform enablers; 

Artificial intelligence/big data enabled diagnostic providers or clinical data analytical platform provider; and 

Private hospitals and specialty clinic chains, in particular those with higher patient economics such as on oncology, orthopedics, dental, plastic surgery, rehabilitation and chronic disease management. These specialty hospitals/clinic chains tend to have higher patient concentrate/occupancy, larger treatment ticket size and better margin. 

Acquisition Criteria 

We have sought and will continue
to seek to identify companies that have compelling market presence, growth potential and a combination of the following characteristics.
We have used and continue to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter our
initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire companies or
assets that we believe have the following attributes: 

Growth Potential: high growth history and future trajectory in revenue top line, above industry average; 

Competitive Position: Leading or growing market share compared to peer group; 

Management Team: Talented, highly motivated, experienced with strong execution track record; 

Profitability or visible path to profitability: Strong business economics and good operating results leading to profitability; and 

Solid technology in digital and/or AI/big data-assisted healthcare applications. 

These criteria are not intended
to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant,
on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. 

Status as a Public Company 

We believe our structure makes
us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses, such as AOI. As an existing public company, we offer a target business
an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners
of the target business would exchange their shares of stock, shares or other equity interests in the target business for our shares or
for a combination of shares of our shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. See
 The AOI Merger above for more information regarding such exchange in the AOI Merger. Although there are various costs and
obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost-effective method
to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses
incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business
combination with us. 

10 

Furthermore, once a proposed
business combination is completed, such as the AOI Merger, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial
public offering is always subject to the underwriters ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which
could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business
would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders 
interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in
attracting talented employees. 

Financial Position 

With funds available for an
initial business combination initially in the amount of 21,319,155 (as of December 31, 2022), we offer a target business, such as AOI,
a variety of options to facilitate a business combination and fund future expansion and growth of its business. Because we are able to
consummate a business combination using the cash proceeds from our initial public offering, our share capital, debt or a combination of
the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use an efficient structure allowing us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target
business to address the needs of the parties. However, if a business combination requires us to use substantially all of our cash to pay
for the purchase price, we may need to arrange third party financing to help fund our business combination. Accordingly, our flexibility
in structuring a business combination may be subject to these constraints. 

Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 

We are not presently engaged
in, and we will not engage in, any operations other than the pursuit of our initial business combination, for an indefinite period of
time. We intend to complete our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private
placement of the private placement units, our share capital debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial
business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable
or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses,
although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company
with nominal operations. 

If our initial business combination
is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration
in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of our ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released
to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company,
the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase
of other assets, companies or for working capital. 

We may seek to raise additional
funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination (which
may include a specified future issuance), and we may complete our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather
than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such
financing only simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with
assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose
the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions
on our ability to raise funds privately, including pursuant to any specified future issuance, or through loans in connection with our
initial business combination. 

The time required to select
and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process,
are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of
a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and
will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 

11 

Sources of Target Businesses 

We receive proprietary transaction
opportunities as a result of the business relationships, direct outreach, and deal sourcing activities from the network built up by our
management team and by the members of our Board. Target business candidates, such as AOI, have been brought to our attention from various
unaffiliated sources, including investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms, private equity groups, large business enterprises,
and other market participants. These sources introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited
basis, since many of these sources will have read the prospectus of our initial public offering and know what types of businesses we are
targeting. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company
following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in
our selection process of an acquisition candidate. In no event will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity
with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they
render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). 

We are not prohibited from
pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors.
In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor,
officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm
which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial
point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of
a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary
or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting
such business combination opportunity to us, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Mr. Kevin Chen has agreed that if he becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that might be suitable to the Company s
business or investment strategy through his directorship in another blank check company, he will recuse himself from all discussions,
deliberations, or decisions of the other blank check company with respect to such opportunity. 

Lack of Business Diversification 

For an indefinite period of
time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance
of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or
several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in
a single line of business. In addition, we are focusing our search for an initial business combination in a single industry. By completing
our business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and 

cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target s
Management Team 

Although we closely scrutinize
the management of a prospective target business, including the AOI management team, when evaluating the desirability of effecting our
business combination with that business and plan to continue to do so if the AOI Merger is not consummated and we seek other business
combination opportunities, our assessment of the target business management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future
management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of
members of our management team or of our board, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it
is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our business combination, including
the AOI Merger, it is presently unknown if any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our business combination.
Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations
of the particular target business. The determination as to whether any members of our board of directors will remain with the combined
company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. 

12 

Following a business combination,
to the extent that we deem it necessary, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management team of the
target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have
the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 

Selection of a Target Business and Structuring
of a Business Combination 

Subject to the requirement
that, so long as our securities are listed on Nasdaq, our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses or assets
having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80 of the value of the trust account (less certain advisory fees to I-Bankers and
taxes payable on interest earned and less any interest earned thereon that is released to us for taxes) at the time of the agreement to
enter into such initial business combination, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting
one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another
blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. In any case, we will only consummate an initial business combination
in which we become the majority shareholder of the target (or control the target through contractual arrangements in limited circumstances
for regulatory compliance purposes as discussed below) or are otherwise not required to register as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act. To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in
its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management
endeavors to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not properly ascertain or assess all significant risk
factors. 

In evaluating a prospective
target business, we have conducted and will continue conduct an extensive due diligence review which encompasses, among other things,
meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available
to us. This due diligence review is conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, although we have
no current intention to engage any such third parties. 

The time and costs required
to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any
degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which
a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise
complete a business combination. 

Fair Market Value of Target Business or Businesses 

So long as our securities
are listed on Nasdaq, the target business or businesses or assets with which we effect our initial business combination must have a collective
fair market value equal to at least 80 of the value of the trust account (less certain advisory fees to I-Bankers and taxes payable
on interest earned and less any interest earned thereon that is released to us for taxes) at the time of the agreement to enter into such
initial business combination. So long as our securities are listed on Nasdaq, if we acquire less than 100 of one or more target
businesses in our initial business combination, the aggregate fair market value of the portion or portions we acquire must equal at least
80 of the value of the trust account (less certain advisory fees to I-Bankers and taxes payable on interest earned and less any
interest earned thereon that is released to us for taxes) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination.
However, we will always acquire at least a controlling interest in a target business. The fair market value of a portion of a target business
or assets will likely be calculated by multiplying the fair market value of the entire business by the percentage of the target we acquire.
We may seek to consummate our initial business combination with an initial target business or businesses with a collective fair market
value in excess of the balance in the trust account. 

13 

In order to consummate such
an initial business combination, like the AOI Merger, we may issue a significant amount of debt, equity or other securities to the sellers
of such business and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt, equity or other securities (although our amended
and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that we may not issue securities that can vote with ordinary shareholders
on matters related to our pre-initial business combination activity). If we issue securities in order to consummate such an initial
business combination, our shareholders could end up owning a minority of the combined company s voting securities as there is no
requirement that our shareholders own a certain percentage of our company (or, depending on the structure of the initial business combination,
an ultimate parent company that may be formed) after our business combination. 

We will structure our initial
business combination to acquire 100 of the equity interest or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure
our initial business combination to acquire less than 100 of such interests or assets of the target business, but we will only consummate
such business combination if we will become the majority shareholder of the target (or control the target through contractual arrangements
in limited circumstances for regulatory compliance purposes) or are otherwise not required to register as an investment company 
under the Investment Company Act. Even though we will own a majority interest in the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination
may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and
us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares
in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests. In this case, we would acquire a 100 controlling
interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior
to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. 

The fair market value of a
target business or businesses or assets will be determined by our board of directors based upon standards generally accepted by the financial
community, such as actual and potential gross margins, the values of comparable businesses, earnings and cash flow, book value and, where
appropriate, upon the advice of appraisers or other professional consultants. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine
that the target business or assets has a sufficient fair market value to meet the threshold criterion, we will obtain an opinion from
an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criterion.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless we consummate a business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain an
opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm that the price we are paying is fair to our shareholders.
Based on the valuation analysis of our management and board of directors, we have determined that the fair market value of AOI was substantially
in excess of 80 of the funds in the trust account and that the 80 test was therefore satisfied. 

Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve
Our Initial Business Combination 

We may conduct redemptions
without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing
requirement (as is the case with the AOI Merger), or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons. 

Under Nasdaq s listing
rules, shareholder approval would typically be required for our initial business combination if, for example: 

We issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20 of the number of our ordinary shares then-outstanding (other than in a public offering); 

Any of our directors, officers or substantial shareholder (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5 or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10 of greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in issued and outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 5 or more; or 

The issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control. 

14 

The decision as to whether
we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which shareholder approval is not required
by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and reasons, which include a variety of factors, including,
but not limited to: 

the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine shareholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek shareholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company; 

the expected cost of holding a shareholder vote; 

the risk that the shareholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination; 

other time and budget constraints of the company; and 

additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to shareholders. 

See The AOI Merger 
above for more information regarding the requisite approvals needed for the AOI Merger. 

Ability to Extend Time to Complete Business
Combination 

On November 9, 2021, the Sponsor
requested that the Company extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from November 12, 2021, to February
12, 2022. The extension was the first of up to two three-month extensions permitted under the Company s prior governing documents.
In connection with such extension, the sponsor caused an aggregate of 900,000 to be deposited into the Company s trust account
on November 10, 2021. 

On February 9, 2022, Edoc
held an extraordinary general meeting pursuant to which Edoc s shareholders approved extending the date by which Edoc had to complete
a business combination from February 12, 2022 to August 12, 2022. In connection with the approval of the extension, shareholders elected
to redeem an aggregate of 6,326,758 Ordinary Shares. As a result, an aggregate of 64,996,857.71 (or approximately 10.27 per share) was
released from the Trust Account to pay such shareholders and 5,477,242 Ordinary Shares were issued and outstanding at February 11, 2022. 

On August 12, 2022, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting
pursuant to which the Company s shareholders approved extending the date by which the Company had to complete a Business Combination
from August 12, 2022 to February 12, 2023. In connection with the approval of the extension, shareholders elected to redeem an aggregate
of 646,617 Class A ordinary shares. As a result, an aggregate of 6,660,150 (or approximately 10.30 per share) was released from the
Trust Account to pay such shareholders and 4,830,625 Ordinary Shares were issued and outstanding on August 13, 2022. In connection with such extension, the sponsor caused an aggregate
of 202,460 to be deposited into the Company s trust account and intends to pay an additional 303,944 (plus any applicable interest) into the trust account during the week
of January 23, 2023. 

Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon
Consummation of Our Initial Business Combination 

We will provide our public
shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion their shares upon the consummation of our initial business combination, such
as the AOI Merger, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including
interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein.
As of December 31, 2022, the amount in the trust account was approximately 10.52 per share. The per-share amount we will distribute
to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by certain advisory fees we will pay to I-Bankers. Our initial shareholders
have agreed to waive their right to receive liquidating distributions if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within
the requisite time period. However, if our initial shareholders or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares
in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to receive liquidating distributions with respect to such public shares
if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required time period. 

15 

Manner of Conducting Redemptions 

We will provide our public
shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination
either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. 

We intend to hold a shareholder
vote in connection with our business combination. In such case, we will: 

conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and 

file proxy materials with the SEC. 

In the event that we seek
shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our
public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon consummation of the initial business combination. 

If we seek shareholder approval,
we will consummate our initial business combination only if we obtain the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law,
which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company. In such
case, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares, private shares and any public shares purchased during or after
the offering in favor of our initial business combination and our officers and directors have also agreed to vote any public shares purchased
during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares
irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial shareholders have agreed to waive
their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private shares and public shares in connection with the consummation of
our initial business combination. 

In no event will we redeem
our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than 5,000,001 prior to or upon the consummation of
our initial business combination. Furthermore, the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial
business combination. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset
requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares and the related business
combination, and instead may search for an alternate business combination. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote in conjunction with their initial business combination for business or other legal reasons
(so long as shareholder approval is not required by the rules of Nasdaq), we will conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules
of the SEC and our memorandum and articles of association. In such case, we will: 

offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and 

file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to consummating our initial business combination which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and we will not be permitted to consummate our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. 

In the event we conduct redemptions
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem shall remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a)
under the Exchange Act. 

16 

In connection with the successful
consummation of our business combination, we may redeem pursuant to a tender offer up to that number of ordinary shares that would permit
us to maintain net tangible assets of at least 5,000,001 prior to or upon the consummation of our initial business combination. However,
the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our proposed initial business combination. For example,
the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or members of its management team,
(ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the allocation of
cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration
we would be required to pay for all shares that are validly tendered plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the
terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not consummate the business combination,
we will not purchase any shares pursuant to the tender offer and all shares will be returned to the holders thereof following the expiration
of the tender offer. Additionally, since we are required to maintain net tangible assets of at least 5,000,001 prior to or upon the consummation
of our initial business combination (which may be substantially higher depending on the terms of our potential business combination),
the chance that the holders of our ordinary shares electing to redeem in connection with a redemption conducted pursuant to the proxy
rules will cause us to fall below such minimum requirement is increased. 

When we conduct a tender offer
to redeem our public shares upon consummation of our initial business combination, in order to comply with the tender offer rules, the
offer will be made to all of our shareholders, not just our public shareholders. Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption
rights with respect to their founder shares, private shares and public shares in connection with any such tender offer. 

Limitation on Redemption Rights upon Consummation
of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval 

If we seek shareholder approval
of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender
offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, individually or together
with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group 
(as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an
aggregate of 15 of the shares sold in our initial public offering, which we refer to as the Excess Shares. We believe this restriction
will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to
exercise their redemption rights as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market
price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15 of the shares sold
in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder s shares are not purchased by us
or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders 
ability to redeem no more than 15 of the shares sold in our initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small
group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to consummate our initial business combination, particularly in connection
with our initial business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders ability to vote all of their shares (including all shares
held by those shareholders that hold more than 15 of the shares sold in our initial public offering) for or against our initial business
combination. We will resolve any disputes relating to whether a public shareholder is acting in concert or as a group either
by requiring certifications under the penalty of perjury to such effect by public shareholders or via adjudication in court. 

See The AOI Merger 
above for more information regarding the requisite approvals and the redemption rights related to the AOI Merger. 

Permitted Purchases of Our Securities by Our
Affiliates 

If we seek shareholder approval
of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer
rules, our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market
either prior to or following the consummation of our initial business combination. Such a purchase would include a contractual acknowledgement
that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not
to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers or their affiliates purchase shares in privately
negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders
would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. Although very unlikely, our initial shareholders, officers,
directors and their affiliates could purchase sufficient shares so that the initial business combination may be approved without the majority
vote of public shares held by non-affiliates. It is intended that purchases will comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange
Act, which provides a safe harbor for purchases made under certain conditions, including with respect to timing, pricing and volume of
purchases. 

17 

The purpose of such purchases
would be to (1) increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (2) to satisfy a closing
condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of the
business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the consummation of an initial
business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. 

As a consequence of any such
purchases, the public float of our ordinary shares may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities
may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain the listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange following
consummation of a business combination. 

Tendering Share Certificates in Connection
With a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights 

We will require our public
shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, 
to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the expiration date set forth in the tender offer documents mailed
to such holders, or in the event we distribute proxy materials, up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the
business combination, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the DWAC System, at the holder s option.
Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer
period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its
shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for shareholders
to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 

There is a nominal cost associated
with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The
transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker 45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on
to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption
rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of
when such delivery must be effectuated. 

The foregoing is different
from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations,
many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders vote on our initial business combination, and
a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking
to exercise his redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange
for him to deliver his certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an option window after the
consummation of the business combination during which he could monitor the price of the company s shares in the market. If the price
rose above the redemption price, he could sell his shares in the open market before actually delivering his shares to the company for
cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would
become option rights surviving past the consummation of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its
certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery at or prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder s election
to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved. 

Any request to redeem such
shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the general meeting
set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with
an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder
may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to
be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our
initial business combination. 

18 

If the initial business combination
is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be
entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates
delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 

If our initial proposed business
combination is not consummated, we may continue to try to consummate our initial business combination with a different target until February
12, 2023. 

Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation
If No Initial Business Combination 

Our amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association currently provide that we will have only until February 12, 2023, to consummate an initial business combination.
If we have not consummated an initial business combination by February 12, 2023 or are unable to obtain shareholder approval to further
extend this deadline, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably
possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to
the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously
released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then-outstanding public
shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive
further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the
approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and
(iii) to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to
consummate an initial business combination by February 12, 2023. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide
that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures
with respect to the liquidation of the trust account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter,
subject to applicable Cayman Islands law. 

Our initial shareholders and
each member of our management team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their rights to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares they hold if we fail to consummate an initial business
combination by February 12, 2023 (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any
public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame). 

Our initial shareholders,
executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any
amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our
obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial
business combination or to redeem 100 of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by February 12, 2023
or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, unless we provide
our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price,
payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the
trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any, divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares.
However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than 5,000,001 (so that
we do not then become subject to the SEC s penny stock rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with
respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with
the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval
of any such amendment, whether proposed by our initial shareholders, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other
person. 

We expect that all costs and
expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining
out of the 13,726 held outside the trust account as of December 31, 2022, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient
funds for such purpose. 

19 

If we were to expend all of
the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the
trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received
by shareholders upon our dissolution would be approximately 10.52. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become
subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you
that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be less than 10.17, plus interest (net of taxes payable,
and less up to 100,000 of interest to pay liquidation expenses). While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that
we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors claims. 

Although we seek to have all
vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving
any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders,
there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from
bringing claims against the trust account including, but not limited, to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or
other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with
respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third-party refuses to execute an agreement
waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to
it and will only enter into an agreement with a third-party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third-party s
engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third-party that
refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed
by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management
is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Marcum and the representative for the underwriter will not execute an
agreement with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will
agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with
us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our
sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third-party for services rendered or products
sold to us (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), or a prospective target business with which we have discussed
entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) 10.17 per public share and
(ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less
than 10.17 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn
to pay our tax obligations, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third-party or prospective target business
that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of
the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event
that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against our sponsor, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability
for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we
independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you
that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our initial shareholders, officers or directors will indemnify us
for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 

In the event that the proceeds
in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) 10.17 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held
in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than 10.17 per public share due to reductions in
the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, and our sponsor
asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular
claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations.
While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification
obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any
particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption
price will not be less than 10.17 per public share. 

We seek to reduce the possibility
that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers,
prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest
or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity
of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have
access to the amounts held outside the trust account 13,726 as of December 31, 2022) with which to pay any such potential claims (including
costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately 100,000). In the
event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who
received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors, however such liability will not be greater than the
amount of funds from our trust account received by any such shareholder. 

20 

If we file a bankruptcy or
winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds
held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and
subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete
the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return 10.52 per public share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if
we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is
not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy or insolvency
laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency
court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having
breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims
of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure
you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 

Our public shareholders will
be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete
our initial business combination by February 12, 2023, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A
ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100 of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by February 12, 2023 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating
to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion
of the initial business combination. Public shareholders who redeem their Class A ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder
vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the trust account upon the subsequent
completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if we have not consummated an initial business combination by February 12,
2023, with respect to such Class A ordinary shares so redeemed. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest
of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination,
a shareholder s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder s redeeming its
shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described
above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote. 

Competition 

In identifying, evaluating
and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, such as AOI, we have encountered and may continue to encounter intense
competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups,
venture capital funds leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well
established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover,
many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target
businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition
of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that, so long as our securities are listed on Nasdaq, we acquire a target business
or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80 of the value of the trust account (less certain advisory fees to I-Bankers and
taxes payable on interest earned and less any interest earned thereon that is released to us for taxes) at the time of the agreement to
enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption
rights, and our outstanding rights and warrants and the potential future dilution they represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain
target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination. 

21 

Employees 

We have two officers. These
individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their time as they deem
necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time our officers devote in any time
period varies based on the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees
prior to the consummation of our initial business combination. 

Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 

We have registered our units,
Class A ordinary shares, rights and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we
file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will
contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 

We will provide shareholders
with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials
sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements must be prepared in accordance with,
or be reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS and the historical financial statements must be audited in accordance with the standards of PCAOB.
These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable
to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and consummate our initial
business combination within the applicable time frame. 

We are required to have our
internal control procedures evaluated for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A
target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls.
The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time
and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. 

We have filed a Registration
Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result,
we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15
to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination. 

We are an emerging
growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to
take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging
growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements,
and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of
any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be
a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 

In addition, Section 107
of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided
in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging
growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 

22 

We will remain an emerging
growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following November 12, 2025, the fifth anniversary
of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.07 billion,
or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that are held
by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, and (2) the
date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 

We are a Cayman Islands exempted
company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted
from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Law. As an exempted company, we have applied for and received a tax exemption
undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (2018 Revision) of the
Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing
any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be
levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on
or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of
dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due
under a debenture or other obligation of us. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

As a smaller reporting company,
we are not required to include risk factors in this Report. However, below is a partial list of material risks, uncertainties and other
factors that could have a material effect on the Company and its operations: 

we are a blank check Company with no revenue or basis to evaluate our ability to select a suitable business target; 

we may not be able to select an appropriate target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination in the prescribed time frame; 

our expectations around the performance of a prospective target business or businesses may not be realized; 

we may not be successful in retaining or recruiting required officers, key employees or directors following our initial business combination; 

our officers and directors may have difficulties allocating their time between the Company and other businesses and may potentially have conflicts of interest with our business or in approving our initial business combination; 

we may not be able to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination or reduce the number of shareholders requesting redemption; 

we may issue our shares to investors in connection with our initial business combination at a price that is less than the prevailing market price of our shares at that time; 

you may not be given the opportunity to choose the initial business target or to vote on the initial business combination; 

trust account funds may not be protected against third party claims or bankruptcy; 

an active market for our public securities may not develop and you will have limited liquidity and trading; 

the availability to us of funds from interest income on the trust account balance may be insufficient to operate our business prior to the business combination; and 

23 

our financial performance following a business combination with an entity may be negatively affected by their lack an established record of revenue, cash flows and experienced management 

there may be more competition to find an attractive target for an initial business combination, which could increase the costs associated with completing our initial business combination; 

Changes in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an initial business combination; 

We may engage one or more of our underwriters or one of their respective affiliates to provide additional services to us after the initial public offering, which may include acting as a financial advisor in connection with an initial business combination or as placement agent in connection with a related financing transaction. Our underwriters are entitled to receive deferred underwriting commissions that will be released from the trust account only upon a completion of an initial business combination. These financial incentives may cause them to have potential conflicts of interest in rendering any such additional services to us after the initial public offering, including, for example, in connection with the sourcing and consummation of an initial business combination; 

Since our initial shareholders will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed (other than with respect to any public shares they may acquire during or after this offering), and because our sponsor, officers and directors may profit substantially even under circumstances in which our public stockholders would experience losses in connection with their investment, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business combination; 

Changes in laws or regulations or how such laws or regulations are interpreted or applied, or a failure to comply with any laws or regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations; 

Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange prior to an initial business combination, which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject it to additional trading restrictions; 

The SEC has recently issued proposed rules relating to certain activities of SPACs. Certain of the procedures that we, a potential business combination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with such proposals may increase our costs and the time needed to complete our initial business combination and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete an initial business combination. The need for compliance with such proposals may cause us to liquidate the funds in the trust account or liquidate the Company at an earlier time than we might otherwise choose; 

The value of the founder shares following completion of our initial business combination is likely to be substantially higher than the nominal price paid for them, even if the trading price of our ordinary shares at such time is substantially less than 10.00 per share; 

If we are deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we would be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities would be severely restricted. As a result, in such circumstances, unless we are able to modify our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we may abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead liquidate the Company; 

24 

To mitigate the risk that we might be deemed to be an investment company
for purposes of the Investment Company Act, on January 5, 2023, we instructed the trustee to liquidate the investments held
in the trust account and instead to hold the funds in the trust account in cash items until the earlier of the consummation
of our initial business combination or our liquidation. As a result, following the liquidation of investments in the trust account,
we will likely receive minimal interest, if any, on the funds held in the trust account, which would likely reduce the dollar amount our
public shareholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company; 

We may not be able to complete an initial business combination with certain potential target companies if a proposed transaction with the target company may be subject to review or approval by regulatory authorities pursuant to certain U.S. or foreign laws or regulations, including the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States; 

Recent increases in inflation and interest rates in the United States and elsewhere could make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination; 

Military conflict in Ukraine or elsewhere may lead to increased price volatility for publicly traded securities, which could make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination; 

We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. If we are unable to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and materially and adversely affect our business and operating results; 

There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and 

Resources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we have not completed our initial business combination within the required time period, our public stockholders may receive only approximately 10.37 per share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account, and our rights and warrants will expire worthless.

Overview 

We are a blank check company
incorporated on August 20, 2020 as a Cayman Islands corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital share exchange,
asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (a Business Combination ).
We consummated our Public Offering (as defined below) on November 12, 2020 and are currently in the process of locating suitable targets
for our business combination. We intend to use the cash proceeds from our Public Offering and the sale of our private placement units
described below as well as additional issuances, if any, of our capital shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt to complete
the Business Combination. 

We expect to incur significant
costs in the pursuit of our initial Business Combination. We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or to complete our initial

legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as expenses as we conduct due diligence on prospective Business
Combination candidates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of December 31, 2022, the
Company had cash outside the Trust Account of 13,726 available for working capital needs. All remaining cash held in the Trust Account
are generally unavailable for the Company s use, prior to an initial business combination, and is restricted for use either in a
Business Combination or to redeem ordinary shares. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, none of the amount in the Trust Account
was available to be withdrawn as described above. 

For the year ended December 31, 2022, cash used in operating activities
was 1,459,672. Net loss of 7,686,390 was affected by accrued interest on promissory note of 36,102, transaction cost of shares transferred
to backstop investors of 5,739,976, change in fair value in warrant liabilities of 180,581, change in fair value in convertible promissory
note of 139,936 and interest earned on marketable securities held in Trust Account of 314,155. Changes in operating assets and liabilities
provided 1,085,312 of cash for operating activities. 

For the year ended December
31, 2021, cash used in operating activities was 777,332. Net loss of 899,880 was affected by accrued interest on promissory note of
 5,027, change in fair value of convertible promissory note of 70,297, interest earned on marketable securities held in Trust of 20,868
and change in fair value in warrant liabilities of 952,674. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided 1,020,766 of cash for

the Company s liquidity needs were satisfied through receipt of 25,000 from the sale of the founder shares, the remaining net proceeds
from the IPO and the sale of private units, and the promissory notes drawn from the Sponsor. 

Until the consummation of
a Business Combination, the Company will be using the funds not held in the Trust Account for identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition
candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to
acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. The Company will need to raise additional capital through
loans or additional investments from its Sponsor, shareholders, officers, directors, or third parties. The Company s Sponsor, officers
and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable
in their sole discretion, to meet the Company s working capital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional
financing. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity,
which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and
reducing overhead expenses. 

These conditions raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern until the earlier of the consummation of the Business Combination
or the date the Company is required to liquidate. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of
the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern.

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements 

As of December 31, 2022, we
did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. We do not participate in transactions
that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which

financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any
non-financial assets.

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial
statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from
those estimates. We have identified the following as our critical accounting policies: 

We do not use derivative instruments
to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. We evaluate all of our financial instruments, including issued stock
purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant
to ASC 480 and ASC 815-15. 

We account for the Public
Warrants, Private Warrants, Rights and Representative Warrants (as defined in Note 5, 6 and 8) collectively Warrants ),
as either equity or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the specific terms of the Warrants and the applicable authoritative
guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 815, Derivatives
and Hedging ASC 815 ). The assessment considers whether the Warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification
under ASC 815, including whether the Warrants are indexed to our own ordinary shares and whether the warrant holders could potentially
require net cash settlement in a circumstance outside of our control, among other conditions for equity classification.
This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of issuance of the Warrants and as of each
subsequent quarterly period end date while the Warrants are outstanding. 

For issued or modified warrants
that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, such warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in
capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, such warrants
are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the
estimated fair value of liability-classified warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. 

We account for the Private
Warrants, Rights and Representative s Warrants in accordance with ASC 815-40 under which the Warrants and FPAs do not meet the criteria
for equity classification and must be recorded as liabilities. The fair value of the Private Warrants, Rights and Representative s
Warrants has been estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model. 

We evaluated the Public Warrants
in accordance with ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity, and concluded that
they met the criteria for equity classification and are required to be recorded as part a component of additional paid-in capital at the
time of issuance. 

Convertible Promissory Note 

The Company accounts for its
convertible promissory note under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). Under 815-15-25, the election can be at the
inception of a financial instrument to account for the instrument under the fair value option under ASC 825. The Company has made such
election for its convertible promissory note. Using fair value option, the convertible promissory note is required to be recorded at its
initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the note are
recognized as non-cash change in the fair value of the convertible promissory note in the statements of operations. The fair value of
the conversion feature of the note was valued utilizing the Monte Carlo model. 

32 

Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible
Redemption 

We account for the Class A
ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from
Equity. Class A ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as a liability instrument and are measured
at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within
the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) are classified
as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders deficit. Our ordinary shares feature certain
redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. On February
9, 2022, we held an extraordinary general meeting pursuant to which our shareholders approved extending the date by which we had to complete
a Business Combination from February 12, 2022 to August 12, 2022. In connection with the approval of the extension, shareholders elected
to redeem an aggregate of 6,326,758 Ordinary Shares. As a result, an aggregate of 64,996,858 (or approximately 10.27 per share) was
released from the Trust Account to pay such shareholders. On August 12, 2022, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting pursuant
to which the Company s shareholders approved extending the date by which the Company has to complete a Business Combination from
August 12, 2022 to February 12, 2023. In connection with the approval of the extension, shareholders elected to redeem an aggregate of
646,617 Ordinary Shares. As a result, an aggregate of 6,660,150 (or approximately 10.30 per share) was released from the Trust Account
to pay such shareholders. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, 2,026,625 and 9,000,000 shares of Class A ordinary
shares subject to possible redemption, respectively, are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders 
deficit section of our balance sheets. 

Net Loss Per Ordinary Share 

The Company applies the two-class
method in calculating earnings per share. The contractual formula utilized to calculate the redemption amount approximates fair value.
The Class feature to redeem at fair value means that there is effectively only one class of stock. Changes in fair value are not considered
a dividend of the purposes of the numerator in the earnings per share calculation. Net loss per ordinary share is computed by dividing
the pro rata net loss between the Class A ordinary shares and the Non-redeemable Class A and Class B ordinary shares by the weighted average
number of ordinary shares outstanding for each of the periods. The calculation of diluted loss per ordinary share does not consider the
effect of the warrants and rights issued in connection with the IPO since the exercise of the warrants and rights are contingent upon
the occurrence of future events and the inclusion of such warrants would be anti-dilutive. The warrants and rights are exercisable for
6,137,400 shares of Class A ordinary shares in the aggregate. 

Recent Accounting Standards 

In August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity s Own
Equity (Subtopic 815-40) ASU 2020-06 to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates
the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies
the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity s own equity. The new standard
also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity s
own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all
convertible instruments. As a smaller reporting company, ASU 2020-06 is effective January 1, 2024 for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2023 and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted beginning on January 1, 2021.
We adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2021. Adoption of the ASU did not impact the Company s financial position, results of operations
or cash flows. 

The Company s management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material
effect on the accompanying financial statements. 

33 

JOBS Act 

The JOBS Act contains
provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We qualify as an emerging
growth company under the JOBS Act and are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the
effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards,
and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards
is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply
with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 

Additionally, we are in the
process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain
conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company, we choose to rely on such exemptions we may
not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an independent registered public accounting firm s attestation report on our
system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may
be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii)
comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the independent
registered public accounting firm s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor
discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation
and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period
of five years following the completion of this offering or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever
is earlier. 

Factors That May Adversely Affect our Results
of Operations 

Our results of operations
and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could cause economic uncertainty
and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted by, among other things,
downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in interest rates, supply
chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including resurgences and
the emergence of new variants, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflict in Ukraine. We cannot at this time fully predict
the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business
and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk. 

Through December 31, 2022,
our efforts have been limited to organizational activities, activities relating to our initial public offering and since the initial public
offering, the search for a target business, such as AOI, with which to consummate an initial business combination. We have engaged in
limited operations and have not generated any revenues. We have not engaged in any hedging activities since our inception on August 20,
2020. We do not expect to engage in any hedging activities with respect to the market risk to which we are exposed. 

The net proceeds of our initial
public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants held in the trust account have been invested in U.S. government treasury
bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company
Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there
will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk. 

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data. 

Reference is made to pages
F-1 through F-25 comprising a portion of this Report, which are included herein by reference. 

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants
on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls are procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and
communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (who serves as our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial
Officer (who serves as our principal financial and accounting officer), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As
required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out
an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022.
Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective due to the
material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the Company s accounting for complex financial
instruments as well as the Company s controls over reconciliations for accrued expenses and prepaid expenses during the
financial statement close and disclosure review process. 

In
reporting certain of its complex financial instruments, the Company had initially reported warrants as a component of equity and upon
reassessment of its accounting for warrants management determined that the private and representative warrants should be classified at
fair value upon issuance, with subsequent changes in fair value reported in the Statement of Operations each reporting period. Additionally,
the Company s Class A ordinary shares have certain redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company and thus require
ordinary shares subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. The Company had previously classified a portion of
Class A ordinary shares in permanent equity. 

Management also identified
material weaknesses related to the calculation of amortization expense and correctly identifying and recording operating accruals and
expenses related to the business combination. As a result, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial
statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this
Annual Report present fairly in all material respects our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the period presented. 

Management
has implemented remediation steps to improve our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting
process. Specifically, we expanded and improved our review process for complex securities and related accounting standards. We plan to
further improve this process by enhancing access to accounting literature, identification and consideration of third-party professionals
with whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications and implementing additional layers of reviews in the financial close process.
The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately
have the intended effects. 

Management s Annual Report on Internal
Controls over Financial Reporting 

As required by SEC rules and
regulations implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 

(1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of our company, 

(2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance
with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors,
and 

(3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could
have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

35 

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our consolidated financial statements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2022. In making these assessments, management used the criteria set forth
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013).
Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2022, due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to complex financial
instruments as well as the Company s controls over reconciliations for accrued expenses and prepaid expenses during the financial
statement close and disclosure review process. 

Management
has implemented remediation steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, we expanded and improved our
review process for complex securities and related accounting standards. We plan to further improve this process by enhancing access to
accounting literature, identification of third-party professionals with whom to consult regarding complex accounting applications and
consideration of additional staff with the requisite experience and training to supplement existing accounting professionals and implemented
additional layers of reviews in the financial close process. 

This Annual Report on Form
10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to our status as an emerging growth
company under the JOBS Act. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

We have commenced our remediation
efforts in connection with the identification of the material weakness discussed above and have taken the following steps during the quarter
ended December 31, 2022: 

We have implemented procedures intended to ensure that we identify and apply the applicable accounting guidance to all complex transactions. 

We are establishing additional monitoring and oversight controls designed to ensure the accuracy and completeness of our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 

Other than the changes discussed
above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Item 9B. Other Information. 

In connection with the third extension of the
Company s termination date, the Company intends to deposit 303,944 (plus any applicable interest) into the trust account during
the week of January 23, 2023.

Number and Terms of Office of Officers and
Directors 

We have five directors. Our
board of directors is divided into three classes with only one class of directors being appointed in each year and each class serving
a three-year term. In accordance with Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual meeting until
one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on Nasdaq. The term of office of the first class of directors, consisting
of Dr. Yan Michael Li, will expire at the first annual general meeting. The term of office of the second class of directors, consisting
of Messrs. Ai and Li, will expire at the second annual general meeting. The term of office of the third class of directors, consisting
of Mr. Chen, will expire at the third annual general meeting. 

Committees of the Board of Directors 

Our board of directors has
two standing committees: an audit committee and a compensation committee. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, the rules
of Nasdaq and Rule 10A of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent
directors. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, the rules of Nasdaq require that the compensation committee of a listed
company be comprised solely of independent directors. Each committee operates under a charter that complies with Nasdaq rules, has been
approved by our board of directors and has the composition and responsibilities described below. The charter of each committee is available
on our website at https://edocmed.net/governance. 

Audit Committee 

We have established an audit
committee of the board of directors. Messrs. Li, Zheng and Li serve as members of our audit committee. Mr. Zheng serves as chairman
of the audit committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have three members of the audit
committee all of whom must be independent. Each of Messrs. Li, Zheng and Li are independent. 

Each member of the audit committee
is financially literate and our board of directors has determined that Mr. Ai qualifies as an audit committee financial expert 
as defined in applicable SEC rules. 

Responsibilities of the audit
committee include: 

the appointment, compensation, retention, replacement, and oversight of the work of the independent auditors and any other independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us; 

pre-approving all audit and non-audit services to be provided by the independent auditors or any other registered public accounting firm engaged by us, and establishing pre-approval policies and procedures; 

reviewing and discussing with the independent auditors all relationships the auditors have with us in order to evaluate their continued independence; 

39 

setting clear hiring policies for employees or former employees of the independent auditors; 

setting clear policies for audit partner rotation in compliance with applicable laws and regulations; 

obtaining and reviewing a report, at least annually, from the independent auditors describing (i) the independent auditor s internal quality-control procedures and (ii) any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, or peer review, of the audit firm, or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities, within, the preceding five years respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the firm and any steps taken to deal with such issues; 

reviewing and approving any related party transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC prior to us entering into such transaction; and 

reviewing with management, the independent auditors, and our legal advisors, as appropriate, any legal, regulatory or compliance matters, including any correspondence with regulators or government agencies and any employee complaints or published reports that raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies and any significant changes in accounting standards or rules promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. 

Compensation Committee 

We have established a compensation
committee of the board of directors. The members of our compensation committee are Messrs. Gang Li and Yan Michael Li. Gang Li serves
as chairman of the compensation committee. We have adopted a compensation committee charter, which details the principal functions of
the compensation committee, including: 

reviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officer s compensation, evaluating our Chief Executive Officer s performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officer based on such evaluation in executive session at which the Chief Executive Officer is not present; 

reviewing and approving the compensation of all of our other officers; 

reviewing our executive compensation policies and plans; 

implementing and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans; 

assisting management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements; 

approving all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our officers and employees; 

producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and 

reviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors. 

40 

The charter also provides
that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or
other adviser and is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However, before
engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee will
consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC. 

Director Nominations 

We do not have a standing
nominating committee, though we intend to form a corporate governance and nominating committee as and when required to do so by law or
Nasdaq rules. In accordance with Rule 5605(e)(2) of the Nasdaq rules, a majority of the independent directors may recommend a director
nominee for selection by the board of directors. The board of directors believes that the independent directors can satisfactorily carry
out the responsibility of properly selecting or approving director nominees without the formation of a standing nominating committee.
The directors who shall participate in the consideration and recommendation of director nominees are Messrs. Ai, Li and Yan. In accordance
with Rule 5605(e)(1)(A) of the Nasdaq rules, all such directors are independent. As there is no standing nominating committee, we
do not have a nominating committee charter in place. 

The board of directors also
considers director candidates recommended for nomination by our shareholders during such times as they are seeking proposed nominees to
stand for appointment at the next annual general meeting (or, if applicable, an extraordinary general meeting). Our shareholders that
wish to nominate a director for election to the Board should follow the procedures set forth in our amended and restated memorandum and
articles of association. We have not formally established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary
for directors to possess. In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, the board of directors considers educational
background, diversity of professional experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom,
and the ability to represent the best interests of our shareholders. 

Code of Ethics 

We have adopted a code of
ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. We have filed our code
of ethics and our audit committee and compensation committee charters with the SEC and copies are available on our website at www.edocmed.net.
You are able to review these documents by accessing our public filings at the SEC s web site at www.sec.gov . In addition,
a copy of the code of ethics will be provided without charge upon request from us. We intend to disclose any amendments to or waivers
of certain provisions of our code of ethics in a Current Report on Form 8-K. 

Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act 

Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act requires our executive officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10 of a registered class of our equity securities
to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our common stock and other equity securities.
These executive officers, directors, and greater than 10 beneficial owners are required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies of
all Section 16(a) forms filed by such reporting persons. Based solely on our review of such forms furnished to us and written representations
from certain reporting persons, we believe that during the year ended December 31, 2022, all reports applicable to our executive officers,
directors and greater than 10 beneficial owners were filed in a timely manner in accordance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. 

Item 11. Executive Compensation 

No compensation will be paid
to our sponsor, officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, prior to or in connection with the consummation of our
initial business combination. Additionally, these individuals are reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations.
Our independent directors review on a quarterly basis all payments that are made to our sponsor, officers, directors, or our or their
affiliates. 

41 

After the completion of our
initial business combination, such as the AOI Merger, members of our management team who remain with us, may be paid consulting, management
or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to shareholders, to the extent then known, in the
tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials furnished to our shareholders in connection with a proposed business combination.
It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business
to determine executive and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid to our officers will be determined, or recommenced, to the
board of directors for determination, either by a committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent
directors on our board of directors. 

We do not intend to take any
action to ensure that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the consummation of our initial business combination,
although it is possible that some or all of our officers and directors may negotiate employment or consulting arrangements to remain with
us after the initial business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements to retain their positions
with us may influence our management s motivation in identifying or selecting a target business but we do not believe that the ability
of our management to remain with us after the consummation of our initial business combination will be a determining factor in our decision
to proceed with any potential business combination. We are not party to any agreements with our officers and directors that provide for
benefits upon termination of employment. 

The compensation committee
has reviewed and discussed this Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management and, based upon its review and discussions, the compensation
committee recommended to the board of directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Report. 

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial
Owners and Management and Related Shareholder Matters 

The following table sets forth
information regarding the beneficial ownership of our ordinary shares as of January 23, 2023, based on information obtained from the persons
named below, with respect to the beneficial ownership of ordinary shares, by: 

each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5 of our outstanding ordinary shares; 

each of our executive officers and directors that beneficially owns our ordinary shares; and 

all our executive officers and directors as a group.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related
Transactions, and Director Independence 

In September 2020, we issued
an aggregate of 2,875,000 founder shares to our initial shareholders for an aggregate purchase price of 25,000, or approximately 0.01
per share, with 2,875,000 shares issued to our sponsor, American Physicians LLC. On November 9, 2020, the Sponsor surrendered
an aggregate of 287,500 founder shares, which were cancelled, resulting in an aggregate of 2,587,500 founder shares outstanding and held
by the Sponsor. On December 24, 2020, our sponsor forfeited 337,500 founder shares following the expiration of the exercise period for
the underwriters over-allotment option. 

Our initial shareholders have
agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the founder shares (except to certain permitted transferees as described below) until, with
respect to 50 of the founder shares, the earlier of (i) six months after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination
or (ii) the date on which the closing price of our ordinary shares equals or exceeds 12.50 per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions,
share dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing after our
initial business combination, with respect to the remaining 50 of the founder shares, upon six months after the date of the consummation
of our initial business combination, or earlier, in either case, if, subsequent to our initial business combination, we consummate a subsequent
liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange
their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property. 

On November 12, 2020, simultaneously
with the closing of our initial public offering, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 414,000 insider units in a private placement at
a purchase price of 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of 4,140,000. Our sponsor has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any
of the shares included in the insider units and the respective ordinary shares underlying the private rights and private warrants included
in the insider units until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. 

Our sponsor previously agreed
to make available to us office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative services, as we may require from time to time, at a
rate of 10,000 per month. Effective March 31, 2021, we terminated the agreement (and any accrued obligations pursuant thereto) under
which we were obligated to make such monthly payments. Since our initial public offering, we have paid for services rendered and expenses
advanced by our sponsor on an as-needed basis. 

Other than reimbursement of
any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and
performing due diligence on suitable business combinations, no compensation or fees of any kind, including finder s fees, consulting
fees, non-cash payments or other similar compensation, will be paid to our officers or directors, or to any of their respective affiliates,
prior to or with respect to our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). Our independent directors
will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates and will be
responsible for reviewing and approving all related party transactions as defined under Item 404 of Regulation S-K, after reviewing
each such transaction for potential conflicts of interests and other improprieties. 

44 

Our sponsor entered
into an agreement in accordance with the guidelines of Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, to place limit orders, through ED F
Man Capital Markets Inc., an independent broker-dealer registered under Section 15 of the Exchange Act which is not affiliated with
us nor part of the underwriting or selling group, to purchase an aggregate of up to 3,750,000 of our rights in the open market at market
prices, and not to exceed 0.20 per right during the period commencing on the later of (i) December 10, 2020, the date separate trading
of the rights commenced or (ii) sixty calendar days after the end of the restricted period under Regulation M, continuing
until the date that was the earlier of (a) November 9, 2021 and (b) the date that we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement
in connection with our initial business combination, or earlier in certain circumstances as described in the limit order agreement. The
limit orders required such members of our sponsor to purchase any rights offered for sale (and not purchased by another investor) at or
below a price of 0.20, until the earlier of (x) the expiration of the buyback period or (y) the date such purchases reach 3,750,000 rights
in total. Our sponsor would not have any discretion or influence with respect to such purchases and will not be able to sell or transfer
any rights purchased in the open market pursuant to such agreements until following the consummation of a business combination. It was
intended that the broker s purchase obligation would be subject to applicable law, including Regulation M under the Exchange Act,
which may prohibit or limit purchases pursuant to the limit order agreement in certain circumstances. I-Bankers also agreed to purchase
up to 1,250,000 of our rights in the open market at market prices not to exceed 0.20 per right, on substantially similar terms as our
sponsor. The obligations to make any such purchases expired on November 9, 2021, and as of December 31, 2022, no limit orders were placed
by our sponsor or I-Bankers. 

In addition, in order to finance
transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or our officers
and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we consummate our initial business combination, we would
repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the offering proceeds
held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Such
loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without
interest, or, at the lender s discretion, up to 1,500,000 of the notes may be converted upon consummation of our business combination
into additional private units at a price of 10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued 150,000 ordinary
shares if 1,500,000 of notes were so converted, as well as 150,000 rights to receive 15,000 shares and 150,000 warrants to purchase
75,000 shares). 

On
November 9, 2021, the sponsor requested that we extend the date by which we have to consummate an initial business combination from
November 12, 2021, to February 12, 2022. The extension was the first of up to two three-month extensions permitted under our
governing documents. In connection with such extension, the sponsor caused an aggregate of 900,000 to be deposited into our trust
account on November 12, 2021. We issued the sponsor an interest bearing unsecured promissory note (the November 2021
Note in the principal amount of 900,000 which is payable by us upon the earlier of the consummation of an initial business
combination or our liquidation on or before February 12, 2022 (or a later date, if the deadline is extended by an amendment to our
governing documents). Simple interest will accrue on the November 2021 Note at the rate of 4 per annum based on 365 days a year.
The November 2021 Note may be repaid in cash or convertible into units consisting of one ordinary share, one right exchangeable into
one-tenth of one ordinary share, and one warrant exercisable for one-half of one ordinary share at 11.50 per share equal to (x) the
portion of the principal amount of and accrued interest under the November 2021 Note being converted divided by (y) 10.00 rounded
up to the nearest whole number of units. As of December 31, 2022, 941,129 was outstanding under the November 2021 Note
including 41,129 of accrued interest expense, and the fair value of the November 2021 Note was 842,069. 

On February 13, 2022, we issued a promissory note (the February
2022 Note in the principal amount of up to 750,000 to our sponsor. The February 2022 Note bears no interest and is due and payable
upon the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which we consummate an initial business combination and (ii) the date that the winding up
of the Company is effective. At the election of the sponsor, up to 600,000 of the unpaid principal amount of the February 2022 Note may
be converted into units of the Company, each unit consisting of one Class A share of the Company, one right exchangeable into one-tenth
of one Cass A ordinary share and one warrant exercisable for one-half of one Class A ordinary share of the Company upon the consummation
of an initial business combination (the Conversion Units ), equal to (x) the portion of the principal amount of the February
2022 Note being converted, divided by (y) 10.00 rounded up to the nearest whole number of units. The Conversion Units are identical to
the units issued by us to the sponsor in a private placement in connection with our initial public offering. The Conversion Units and
their underlying securities are entitled to the registration rights set forth in the February 2022 Note. As of December 31, 2022, 750,000 was
outstanding under the February 2022 Note including 0 of accrued interest expense, and the fair value of the February 2022 Note was 670,343. 

45 

On August 25, 2022, we issued
a promissory note (the August 2022 Note in the principal amount of up to 202,460 to our Sponsor. The August 2022 Note
bears no interest and is due and payable upon the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which we consummate an initial business combination
and (ii) the date that the winding up of the Company is effective. As of December 31, 2022, 202,460 was outstanding under the August
2022 Note including 0 of accrued interest expense. 

On October 6, 2022, we issued
a promissory note (the October 2022 Note in the principal amount of up to 500,000 to our Sponsor. The October 2022 Note
bears no interest and is due and payable upon the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which we consummate an initial business combination
and (ii) the date that the winding up of the Company is effective. As of December 31, 2022, 500,000 was outstanding under the October
2022 Note including 0 of accrued interest expense. 

On November 16, 2022, the
Company issued a non-interest-bearing promissory note (the November 2022 Note in the principal amount of up to 303,994
(the Extension Funds to our Sponsor, pursuant to which the Extension Funds will be deposited into the trust account for
each Public Share that was not redeemed in connection with the Company s termination date from August 12, 2022 to February 12, 2023.
The principal amount of the November 2022 Note may be drawn down in three equal amounts and the balance of the November 2022 Note is payable
by the Company on the earlier of the consummation of the Business Combination or the date of the liquidation of the Company. In connection
with the third extension of the Company and the November 2022 Note, the Company intends to deposit 303,944 (plus any applicable interest)
into the trust account during the week of January 23, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, 0 was outstanding under the November 2022 Note including
 0 of accrued interest expense. 

After our initial business
combination, such as the AOI Merger, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees
from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our shareholders, to the extent then known, in the tender
offer or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, furnished to our shareholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will
be known at the time of distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a general meeting held to consider our initial business
combination, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director
compensation. 

All ongoing and future transactions
between us and any member of our management team or his or her respective affiliates will be on terms believed by us at that time, based
upon other similar arrangements known to us, to be no less favorable to us than are available from unaffiliated third parties. It is our
intention to obtain estimates from unaffiliated third parties for similar goods or services to ascertain whether such transactions with
affiliates are on terms that are no less favorable to us than are otherwise available from such unaffiliated third parties. If a transaction
with an affiliated third party were found to be on terms less favorable to us than with an unaffiliated third party, we would not engage
in such transaction. 

We are not prohibited from
pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek
to complete our initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee
of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent accounting firm, or independent investment banking firm that our
initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. 

We have entered into a registration
rights agreement with respect to the founder shares, the shares underlying the representative s warrants, and the securities underlying
the private units. 

See Item 1. Business 
for more information regarding the related party agreements related to the AOI Merger.

Director Independence 

Nasdaq requires that a majority
of our board must be composed of independent directors, which is defined generally as a person other than an officer or
employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship, which, in the opinion of the company s
board of directors would interfere with the director s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of
a director. 

Messrs. Gang Li, Jintao Zheng
and Yan Michael Li are our independent directors. Any affiliated transactions are on terms no less favorable to us than could be obtained
from independent parties. Any affiliated transactions must be approved by a majority of our independent and disinterested directors.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 

EDOC Acquisition Corp. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of EDOC Acquisition Corp. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, shareholders 
deficit and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to
as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years
in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Explanatory Paragraph Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1, the Company s business plan
is dependent on the completion of a business combination and the Company s cash and working capital as of December 31, 2022 are
not sufficient to complete its planned activities for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance
date of the financial statements. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit s in accordance with
the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
