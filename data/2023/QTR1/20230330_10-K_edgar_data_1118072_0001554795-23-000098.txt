FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

The U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC encourages
companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand future prospects and make informed investment
decisions. This report contains these types of statements. Words such as may, expect, believe, 
 anticipate, estimate, project, or continue or comparable terminology used in connection
with any discussion of future operating results or financial performance identify forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to
place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. All forward-looking statements
reflect our present expectation of future events and are subject to a number of important factors and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. 

PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Historical Development 

The Company was originally incorporated in the state of Nevada on January
15, 1988, as Data Financial Corporation. On August 5, 1992, Data Financial changed its name to Skinovation Pharmaceutical Incorporated
when it began operations as a licensee for pharmaceutical products; however, that operation ceased in 1993. On November 23, 2016 the Company
filed Articles of Domestication in the state of Wyoming; effectively moving the Company s state of domicile from Nevada to Wyoming. 

Our Business Plan 

Our business plan is to seek, investigate, and, if warranted, acquire an
interest in a business opportunity. Our acquisition of a business opportunity may be made by asset acquisition, merger, exchange of stock,
or otherwise. We have very limited sources of capital, and we probably will only be able to take advantage of one business opportunity.
As of the date of this filing, we have not identified any business opportunity that we plan to pursue, nor have we reached any preliminary
or definitive agreements or understandings with any person concerning an acquisition or merger. 

Based upon current economic conditions, management believes that it is
possible, if not probable, for a company like ours, without many assets or liabilities, to negotiate a merger or acquisition with a viable
private company. The opportunity arises principally because of the expensive legal and accounting fees and the length of time associated
with the registration process of going public. 

Our search for a business opportunity will not be limited to any particular
geographical area or industry and includes both U.S. and international companies. Our management has unrestricted discretion in seeking
and participating in a business opportunity, subject to the availability of such opportunities, economic conditions and other factors.
Our management believes that companies who desire a public market to enhance liquidity for current stockholders, or plan to acquire additional
assets through issuance of securities rather than for cash, will be potential merger or acquisition candidates. 

The selection of a business opportunity in which to participate is complex
and extremely risky and will be made by management in the exercise of their business judgment. Our activities are subject to several significant
risks which arise primarily as a result of the fact that we have no operating business and may acquire or participate in a business opportunity
based on the decision of management which will, in all probability, act without consent, vote, or approval of our stockholders. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to identify and merge with or acquire any business opportunity which will ultimately prove to be beneficial
to Skinovation and our stockholders. Should a merger or acquisition prove unsuccessful, it is possible management may decide not to pursue
further acquisition activities and management may abandon our search and we may become dormant or be dissolved. 

It is possible that the range of business opportunities that might be available
for consideration by us could be limited by the fact that our common stock currently is not listed on any established public trading market.
We cannot assure you that a market will develop or that a stockholder will be able to liquidate his/her/its investments without considerable
delay, if at all. If a market develops, our shares will likely be subject to the rules of the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny
Stock Reform Act of 1990. The liquidity of penny stock is affected by specific disclosure procedures required by those rules to be followed
by all broker-dealers, including but not limited to, determining the suitability of the stock for a particular customer, and obtaining
a written agreement from the customer to purchase the stock. This rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities
and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell our securities in any market. 

4 

Investigation and Selection of Business Opportunities 

We anticipate that business opportunities will come to our attention from
various sources, including our officers and directors, our stockholders, professional advisors, such as attorneys and accountants, securities
broker-dealers, investment banking firms, venture capitalists, members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited
proposals. Management expects that prior personal and business relationships may lead to contacts with these various sources. 

We expect that our due diligence will encompass, among other things, meetings
with the target business s incumbent management and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial
and other information which is made available to our management. This due diligence review may be conducted either by our management or
by unaffiliated third parties we may engage. Our limited funds and the lack of full-time management will likely make it impracticable
to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a target business before we consummate a business combination. We anticipate
that we will rely upon funds provided by loans from management and/or significant stockholders to conduct investigation and analysis of
any potential target companies or businesses. We may also rely upon the issuance of our common stock in lieu of cash payments for services
or expenses related to any analysis. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent
analysis, market surveys and the like which, if we had more funds available to us, would be desirable. We will be particularly dependent
in making decisions upon information provided by the promoters, owners, sponsors or other persons associated with the target business
seeking our participation. 

Our management will analyze the business opportunities; however, none of
our management team are professional business analysts (See Part III, Item 10, below). Our management has had limited experience with
mergers and acquisitions of business opportunities and has not been involved with an initial public offering. Due to management s
limited experience with mergers and acquisitions, they may rely on principal stockholders or associates, or promoters or their affiliates
to assist in the investigation and selection of business opportunities. 

Certain conflicts of interest exist or may develop between us and our executive
officers and directors. They have other business interests to which they currently devote attention, which include a medical practice
and independent contractor services (See Part III, Item 10, below.) Our management may be expected to continue to devote their attention
to these other business interests although management time should be devoted to our business. As a result, conflicts of interest may arise
that can be resolved only through their exercise of judgment in a manner which is consistent with their fiduciary duties to us. 

A decision to participate in a specific business opportunity may be made
upon our management s analysis of: 

the quality of the business opportunity s management and personnel, 

the anticipated acceptability of its new products or marketing concept, 

the merit of its technological changes, 

the perceived benefit that it will derive from becoming a publicly held entity, and 

numerous other factors which are difficult, if not impossible, to analyze through the application of any objective criteria. 

No one factor described above will be controlling in the selection of a
business opportunity. Management will attempt to analyze all factors appropriate to each opportunity and make a determination based upon
reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potential business opportunities may occur in many different industries and at various
stages of development. Thus, the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities will be extremely difficult
and complex. Potential investors must recognize that because of our limited capital available for investigation and management s
limited experience in business analysis, we may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the business opportunity to be
acquired. 

In many instances, we anticipate that the historical operations of a specific
business opportunity may not necessarily be indicative of the potential for the future operations because of the possible need to substantially
shift marketing approaches, significantly expand operations, change product emphasis, change or substantially augment management, or make
other changes. We will be dependent upon the owners of a business opportunity to identify any such problems which may exist and to implement,
or be primarily responsible for, the implementation of required changes. 

5 

Form of Acquisition 

We cannot predict the manner in which we may participate in a business
opportunity. Specific business opportunities will be reviewed as well as our needs and desires and those of the promoters of the opportunity.
The legal structure or method deemed by management to be suitable will be selected based upon our review and our relative negotiating
strength. We may be required to merge, consolidate or reorganize with other corporations or forms of business organizations. In addition,
our present management and stockholders most likely will not have control of a majority of our voting shares following a merger or reorganization
transaction. As part of such a transaction, our existing directors may resign and new directors may be appointed to fill those vacancies
without any vote by our stockholders. 

We likely will acquire our participation in a business opportunity through
the issuance of common stock or other securities. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that
in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called tax free reorganization
under Section 368(a) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code depends upon whether the owners of the
acquired business own 80 or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these
provisions rather than other tax free provisions provided under the Code, all prior stockholders would in that circumstance
retain 20 or less of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. Under other circumstances, depending upon the relative
negotiating strength of the parties, prior stockholders may retain substantially less than 20 of the total issued and outstanding shares
of the surviving entity. This could result in substantial additional dilution to the equity of those persons who were our stockholders
prior to such reorganization. 

In the case of an acquisition, the transaction may be accomplished upon
the sole determination of management without any vote or approval by stockholders. In the case of a statutory merger or consolidation
directly involving the Company, it will likely be necessary to call a stockholders' meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of
a majority of the outstanding securities. The necessity to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense
in the consummation of any proposed transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders. Most likely,
management will seek to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder approval. 

The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and
to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with
respect to the indemnification and evaluation of a prospective business combination that is not ultimately completed may result in a loss
to the Company. Also, fees may be paid in connection with the completion of all types of acquisitions, reorganizations or mergers. These
fees are usually used to pay legal costs, accounting costs, finder s fees, consultant s fees and other related expenses. In
the event that any such fees are paid, they may become a factor in negotiations regarding any potential acquisition or merger by us. We
have no present arrangements or understandings respecting any of these types of fees. 

Significant stockholders may actively negotiate or otherwise consent to
the purchase of all or any portion of their common stock as a condition to, or in connection with, a proposed reorganization, merger or
acquisition. It is not anticipated that any such opportunity will be afforded to other stockholders or that such other stockholders will
be afforded the opportunity to approve or consent to any particular stock buy-out transaction. We have not adopted any procedures or policies
for the review, approval or ratification of any related party transactions. 

6 

In the event we merge or acquire a business opportunity, the successor
company will be subject to our reporting obligations. This is commonly referred to as a back door registration. A back door
registration occurs when a non-reporting company becomes the successor of a reporting company by merger, consolidation, exchange of securities,
acquisition of assets or otherwise. This type of event requires the successor company to file a current report with the SEC which provides
the same kind of information about the company to be acquired that would appear in a registration statement, including audited and pro
forma financial statements. This regulation may eliminate many of the perceived advantages of these types of transactions. Accordingly,
we may incur additional expense to conduct due diligence and present the required information for the business opportunity in any report. 

Also, the SEC may elect to conduct a full review of the successor company
and may issue substantive comments on the sufficiency of disclosure related to the company to be acquired. 

In addition, regulations also deny the use of Form S-8 for the registration
of securities of a shell company, and limit the use of Form S-8 to a reorganized shell company until the expiration of 60 days from when
any such entity is no longer considered to be a shell company. This prohibition could further restrict opportunities for the Company to
acquire companies that may already have stock option plans in place that cover numerous employees. In such an instance, there may be no
exemption from registration for the issuance of securities in any business combination to these employees, thereby necessitating the filing
of a registration statement with the SEC to complete any such reorganization, and incurring the time and expense costs that are normally
avoided by back door registrations. 

Competition 

We expect to encounter substantial competition in our effort to locate
attractive business opportunities. Business development companies, venture capital partnerships and corporations, venture capital affiliates
of large industrial and financial companies, small investment companies, and wealthy individuals will be our primary competition. Many
of these entities will have significantly greater experience, resources and managerial capabilities than we do and will be in a better
position than we are to obtain access to attractive business opportunities. We also will experience competition from other public reporting
companies, many of which may have more funds available for such opportunities. 

Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on Business 

We are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This Act creates a strong
and independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors of public companies and to strengthen auditor independence.
It also requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality
of financial disclosures made by public companies; establishes clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view, possible
conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; creates guidelines for audit committee members appointment, and compensation
and oversight of the work of public companies auditors; prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods;
and establishes a federal crime of securities fraud, among other provisions. 

We are subject to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange
Act and are required to file annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and
will be required to timely disclose certain material events in a Current Report on Form 8-K. We are also subject to Section 14(a) of the
Exchange Act which requires the Company to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding proxy solicitations, as outlined
in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to our stockholders at a special or annual meeting of stockholders or pursuant to a written consent
will require us to provide our stockholders with the information outlined in Schedules 14A or 14C of Regulation 14A; preliminary copies
of this information must be submitted to the SEC at least 10 days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are forwarded
to our stockholders. 

If we acquire a non-reporting issuer under the Exchange Act,
we will be subject to the back-door registration requirements of the SEC that will require us to file a Current Report on
Form 8-K that will include all information about such non-reporting issuer as would have been required to be filed by that
entity had it filed a Form 10 Registration Statement with the SEC. 

Employees 

We currently have no employees. Our management expects to confer with consultants,
attorneys and accountants as necessary. We do not anticipate a need to engage any full-time employees so long as we are seeking and evaluating
business opportunities. We will determine the need for employees based upon a specific business opportunity, if any. 

Available Information 

We currently do not have a Company website.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Executive Overview 

We are an emerging growth company. We recorded non-recurring revenues related
to business development consulting services provided to another company; however, we have not recorded revenues before or since 2012.
We are dependent upon financing to continue basic operations. Management intends to rely upon advances or loans from management, significant
stockholders or third parties to meet our cash requirements, but we have not entered into written agreements guaranteeing funds and, therefore,
no one is obligated to provide funds to us in the future. These factors raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going
concern. Our plan is to combine with an operating company to generate revenue. 

If we obtain a business opportunity, then it may be necessary to raise
additional capital. We likely will sell our common stock to raise this additional capital. We anticipate that we would issue such stock
pursuant to exemptions to the registration requirements provided by federal and state securities laws. The purchasers and manner of issuance
will be determined according to our financial needs and the available exemptions to the registration requirements of the Securities Act
of 1933. We do not currently intend to make a public offering of our stock. We also note that if we issue more shares of our common stock,
then our stockholders may experience dilution in the value per share of their common stock. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have not established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover
our operating costs and we expect to rely upon third parties to pay for our operating expenses. At December 31, 2022 our cash decreased
to 163 compared to 222 at December 31, 2021 as a result of limited financing activities. Our total liabilities increased to 411,498
at December 31, 2022 from 377,814 at December 31, 2021 primarily due to increases in accrued interest for notes payable and notes payable
for cash advances, consulting services and professional services provided by or paid for by third parties. 

We intend to obtain capital from management, significant stockholders and
third parties to cover minimal operations; however, there is no assurance that additional funding will be available. Our ability to continue
as a going concern during the long term is dependent upon our ability to find a suitable business opportunity and acquire or enter into
a merger with such company. The type of business opportunity with which we acquire or merge will affect our profitability for the long
term. 

During the next 12 months we anticipate incurring additional costs related
to the filing of Exchange Act reports. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through advances and loans provided by management,
significant stockholders or third parties. We may also rely on the issuance of our common stock in lieu of cash to convert debt or pay
for expenses.

Results of Operations 

We had no revenues during 2022 or 2021. General and administrative expense
was 14,059 for 2022 compared to 13,830 for 2021. 

Total other expense increased to 19,684 for 2022 compared to 18,620 for
2021 and represents interest expense on loans payable. 

Our net loss increased to 33,743 for 2022 compared to 32,450 for 2021.
Management expects net losses to continue until we acquire or merge with a business opportunity. 

Commitments and Obligations 

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had outstanding notes payable totaling
 255,021 and 240,021, respectively. Accrued interest for notes payable was 150,477 and 130,793 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
All of the notes payable are non-collateralized, carry interest at 8 and are due on demand. During the years ended December 31, 2022
and 2021, we borrowed 9,000 and 3,500, respectively, from third parties and recorded interest expense of 19,684 and 18,620 for the
years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

On December 31, 2022 we converted 6,000 accounts payable owed to a third
party for 2021 to notes payable, resulting in total accounts payable of 6,000 at December 31, 2022. 

On December 31, 2021 we converted 6,000 accounts payable owed to a third
party for 2020 to notes payable, resulting in total accounts payable of 7,000 at December 31, 2021 

Two lenders represent in excess of 95 of the Company s accounts
payable and notes payable at December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or
are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors. 

Emerging Growth Company 

We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the Jumpstart
Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). A company qualifies as an emerging growth company if it has total annual
gross revenues of less than 1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year and, as of December 8, 2011, had not sold common
equity securities under a registration statement. Under the JOBS Act we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain
disclosure requirements 

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging
growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying
with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards
until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition
period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting
standards.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders 

 Skinovation Pharmaceutical Incorporated 

 Salt Lake City, Utah 

 Opinion on the Financial Statements 

 We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of Skinovation Pharmaceutical Incorporated (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of operations, stockholders 
deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our
opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022
and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 

 Consideration of the Company s Ability
to Continue as a Going Concern 

 The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has suffered recurring losses and has no operations
which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters
are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

 Basis for Opinion 

 These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

 We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

 Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS
ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

We have not had a change in or disagreement with our independent registered
public accounting firm on accounting financial disclosure during the past two fiscal years. 

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. This information is accumulated to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. Our President, who serves as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and he determined that our disclosure controls
and procedures were ineffective due to a control deficiency. During the period we did not have additional personnel to allow segregation
of duties to ensure the completeness or accuracy of our information. Due to the size and operations of the Company we are unable to remediate
this deficiency until we acquire or merge with another company. 

Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

Management is responsible to establish and
maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our principal executive officer is responsible to design or supervise a
process that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of finan cial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The policies and procedures
include: 

maintain records in reasonable detail to accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets, 

 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors, and 

 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 

For the year ended
December 31, 2022, management has relied on the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO - 2013), Internal
Control - Integrated Framework, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based upon
that framework, management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting is ineffective due to the lack of additional
personnel to allow segregation of duties to ensure the completeness or accuracy of our information. 

Our management determined that there were no changes made in our internal
controls over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect our internal control over financial reporting. 

ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION 

None.

PART III 

ITEM 10. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 

Directors and Executive Officers 

Our directors and executive officer and their respective ages, positions
and biographical information are presented below. Our bylaws require three directors who serve for terms of one year or until they are
replaced by a qualified director. We currently have one vacancy on our board of directors. Our executive officers are chosen by our board
of directors and serve at its discretion. There are no existing family relationships between or among any of our executive officers or
directors. 

Name 
 Age 
 Position Held 
 Director Term 
 
 Hugo Rodier 
 70 
 Director and President 
 May 2009 until our next annual meeting. 
 
 M. Jeanne Ball 
 65 
 Director and Secretary/Treasurer 
 March 1998 until our next annual meeting. 

Hugo Rodier From 2000 to the present Mr. Rodier has
been a Medical Director with Pioneer Comprehensive Clinic located in Draper, Utah. In addition, since 2002 he has been an adjunct professor
of Family and Preventive Medicine and a member of the Utah School of Medicine Admissions Committee at the University of Utah. He received
his medical degree from the University of Utah, School of Medicine. 

M. Jeanne Ball Ms. Ball works as an independent contractor
performing duties of a legal assistant for attorneys. She has experience serving in management positions for public reporting companies
which may prove significant in our search for a business opportunity and may be critical to our operations moving forward. 

During the past ten years, none of our executive officers have been involved
in any legal proceedings that are material to an evaluation of their ability or integrity; namely: (1) filed a petition under federal
bankruptcy laws or any state insolvency laws, nor had a receiver, fiscal agent or similar officer appointed by a court for the business
or property of such person, or any partnership in which he/she was a general partner at or within two years before the time of such filing,
or any corporation or business association of which he/she was an executive officer at or within two years before the time of such filing;
(2) been convicted in a criminal proceeding or named subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other
minor offenses); (3) been the subject of any order, judgment or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court
of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining him or her from or otherwise limiting his/her involvement in any type
of business, securities or banking activities; or (4) been found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action, by the SEC or
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated any federal or state securities law, and the judgment in such civil action or
finding by the SEC has not been subsequently reversed, suspended, or vacated. 

Code of Ethics 

Since we have only two persons serving as executive officers and directors,
and because we have minimal operations, we have not adopted a code of ethics for our principal executive and financial officers. Our board
of directors will revisit this issue in the future to determine if adoption of a code of ethics is appropriate. In the meantime, our management
intends to promote honest and ethical conduct, full and fair disclosure in our reports to the SEC, and comply with applicable governmental
laws and regulations. 

Corporate Governance 

We are a smaller reporting company with minimal operations and only two
directors and executive officers. As a result, we do not have a standing nominating committee for directors, nor do we have an audit committee
with an audit committee financial expert serving on that committee. Our entire board of directors acts as our nominating and audit committee. 

21 

ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 

Executive Officer Compensation 

None of our named executive officers received any cash or non-cash compensation
from us during the past two fiscal years, and none had outstanding equity awards at year end. We have not entered into employment contracts
with our executive officers and their compensation, if any, will be determined at the discretion of our board of directors. 

We do not offer retirement benefit plans to our executive officers, nor
have we entered into any contract, agreement, plan or arrangement, whether written or unwritten, that provides for payments to a named
executive officer at, or in connection with, the resignation, retirement or other termination of a named executive officer, or a change
in control of the company or a change in the named executive officer s responsibilities following a change in control. 

Compensation of Directors 

We do not have any standard arrangement for compensation of our directors
for any services provided as director, including services for committee participation or for special assignments. 

ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT
AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS 

Securities Under Equity Compensation Plans 

None. 

Beneficial Ownership 

The following tables set forth the beneficial ownership of our outstanding
common stock of our management and of each person or group known by us to own beneficially more than 5 of our voting stock. We have not
issued any shares of preferred stock. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and generally includes
voting or investment power with respect to securities. Except as indicated by footnote, the persons named in the table below have sole
voting power and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock shown as beneficially owned by them. The percentage of beneficial
ownership is based on 708,000 shares of common stock outstanding as of March 29, 2023.

During the past two fiscal years through the date of this report we have
not engaged in, or propose to engage in, any transactions involving our executive officers, directors, 5 or more stockholders or immediate
family members of such persons. 

Director Independence 

None of our directors are independent directors as defined by NASDAQ Stock
Market Rule 5605(a)(2). This rule defines persons as independent who are neither officers nor employees of the company and
have no relationships that, in the opinion of the board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out their
responsibilities as directors. 

ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES 

Auditor Fees 

The following table presents the aggregate fees billed by our independent
public registered accounting firm, Pinnacle Accountancy Group of Utah, in connection with the audit of our financial statements and other

and related services by the accounting firm that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements
that are not reported under audit fees. 

Tax fees represent professional services rendered by the accounting firm
for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning. 

All other fees represent fees billed for products and services provided
by the accounting firm, other than the services reported for the other three categories. 

Pre-approval Policies 

We do not have an audit committee currently serving and as a result our
board of directors performs the duties of an audit committee. Our board of directors will evaluate and approve in advance the scope and
cost of the engagement of an auditor. All services rendered by our principal accountant are performed pursuant to a written engagement
letter between us and the principal accountant. We do not rely on pre-approval policies and procedures.
