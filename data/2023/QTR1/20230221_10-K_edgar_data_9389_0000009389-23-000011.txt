 PART I . Item 1. Business Ball Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, Ball, the company, we or our) is one of the world s leading suppliers of aluminum packaging for the beverage, personal care and household products industries. The company was organized in 1880 and incorporated in the state of Indiana, United States of America (U.S.), in 1922. Our sustainable, aluminum packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are manufactured in facilities around the world. We also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers within our aerospace segment. In 2022, our total consolidated net sales were 15.35 billion. Our packaging businesses were responsible for 87 percent of our net sales, with the remaining 13 percent contributed by our aerospace business. Our largest product line is aluminum beverage containers and we also produce extruded aluminum aerosol containers, recloseable aluminum bottles across multiple consumer categories, aluminum slugs and aluminum cups. We sell our aluminum packaging products globally to large multinational beverage, personal care and household products companies with which we have developed long-term relationships. This is evidenced by our high customer retention and large number of long-term supply contracts. While we have a diversified customer base, we sell a significant portion of our packaging products to major companies and brands, as well as to numerous regional customers. Our significant customers include top consumer packaging and beverage companies. Our aerospace business is a leader in delivering solutions ranging from entire missions to contributing component level expertise through the design, development and manufacture of innovative systems for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance, civil, commercial and national security aerospace markets. It produces spacecraft, instruments and sensors, radio frequency systems and components, data exploitation solutions and a variety of advanced technologies and products that enable weather prediction and climate change monitoring as well as deep space missions. We are headquartered in Westminster, Colorado, and our stock is listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BALL. Our Strategy Our Drive for 10 vision defines our overall business strategy. At its highest level, Drive for 10 is a mindset around perfection, with a greater sense of urgency around our future success. Launched in 2011, Drive for 10 encompasses five strategic levers that are key to growing our businesses and achieving long-term success. These five levers are: Maximizing value in our existing businesses Expanding into new products and capabilities Aligning ourselves with the right customers and markets Broadening our geographic reach and Leveraging our know-how and technological expertise to provide a competitive advantage We also maintain a clear and disciplined financial strategy focused on improving shareholder returns by: Seeking to deliver comparable diluted earnings per share growth of 10 percent to 15 percent per annum over the long-term Maximizing cash flow generation Increasing Economic Value Added (EVA dollars

 The cash generated by our businesses is used primarily: (1) to finance the company s operations, (2) to fund growth capital investments, (3) to service the company s debt and (4) to return value to our shareholders via stock buybacks and dividend payments. From time to time, we have evaluated and expect to continue to evaluate possible transactions that we believe will benefit the company and our shareholders, which may include strategic acquisitions, divestitures of parts of our company or equity investments. At any time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to possible transactions or may have entered into non-binding letters of intent. There can be no assurance if or when we will enter into any such transactions or the terms of such transactions. The compensation of many of our employees is tied directly to the company s performance through our EVA -based incentive programs. Sustainability and Circularity At Ball Corporation, we believe in our people, our culture and our ability to deliver value to our stakeholders. Like uncompromising integrity and customer focus, sustainability and circularity are part of our Drive for 10 vision and have been a part of who we are since our founding in 1880. Our triple bottom-line approach to sustainability environmental, economic and social has evolved over the past 20 years and, together with our objective of providing truly circular economic solutions for our customers, is the lens through which we continue to conduct business at every level of our organization. Sustainability and circularity constitute a key part of our business strategy and influence how we manage and operate our businesses, serve our customers, care for the environment and our communities, secure profits and drive long-term prosperity. We focus our sustainability and circularity efforts on environmental, social and governance (ESG) impacts through the lenses of product stewardship and social impacts, exhibited through our commitment to achieve a science-based 55 percent reduction in our greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint by 2030 and net zero carbon emissions prior to 2050, as well as human capital management, including diversity and inclusion, and community engagement. In our manufacturing operations around the world, we work on continuous improvement of employee safety and engagement, energy and water efficiency, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, waste reduction and recycling. Our commitment extends beyond our walls and includes purchasing aluminum from certified sustainable sources and reducing value chain emissions in order to facilitate achievement of Ball s and its customers GHG reduction objectives. Today s consumers are choosing brands based on their sustainability and circularity credentials. Ball customers understand this growing priority and their unique position in impacting the environment, especially through the packaging materials they use. Infinitely recyclable aluminum unlocks the full potential of packaging to help customers convey their values and purpose to consumers. We are committed to moving toward a truly circular economy, where materials can be and actually are used again and again. Aluminum cans, bottles and cups are an attractive option for sustainability-conscious brands with commitments to real world recyclability and increasing their usage of recycled materials in consumer packaging. Unlike plastic, glass, cartons or compostable containers, aluminum containers are designed to be recycled infinitely without losing quality and retain a high economic value, pushing aluminum collection, sorting and recycling rates to the highest of any beverage packaging material. That is why 75 percent of all aluminum ever produced is still in use today. In addition, growing sustainability compliance costs for substrates with less favorable circularity credentials continue to see their costs of ownership rise in several regions. Aluminum beverage packaging is the leader in real recycling, where the package is collected and then transformed into an item of equal value (product-to-product or material-to-material recycling). In the case of aluminum cans, bottles or cups, which are monomaterial, the aluminum can be recycled and made back into the same product in as little as 60 days. In contrast, only 10 percent of all plastic ever produced has been recycled and is mostly only downcycled. Downcycled products, including but not limited to when plastic is converted to become part of a sneaker or fibers in a carpet, are not sustainable because eventually those products end up in landfills. Real recycling happens when the value of the product being recycled is maintained from one use to another. Because recycling aluminum saves resources and uses significantly less energy than primary aluminum production, we are innovating and collaborating with our customers, supply chain, industry groups and other public and private partners to establish and financially support initiatives to increase recycling rates around the world. We work together to create effective collection and recycling systems and educate consumers about the sustainability and circularity benefits of aluminum packaging. During 2022 the company proactively supported further expansion of Deposit Return Systems

 (DRS) and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) programs in several regions. For example, Colorado signed an EPR program into law in 2022 requiring companies who sell packaging products to fund a statewide recycling system to recycle those materials. Our aerospace business plays a role in sustainability as well. More and more, our systems are measuring key elements of the physical environment and supporting environmental monitoring and operational weather forecasting programs, as well as providing environmental intelligence on weather, the Earth s climate system, precipitation, drought, GHG emissions and air pollution, as well as wildlife, vegetation and other biodiversity measurements. The data captured through Ball built instruments and satellites enable and enhance understanding of the Earth s ecosystem and help scientists to pinpoint more accurately what type of GHGs and pollutants are being emitted, where they are coming from, and a precise idea of where they are moving. At Ball our sustained long-term success depends not only on our products and our operations, but on an engaged workforce. We continue to invest in recruiting to ensure we have the right people with the right skills in the right roles, and in developing our employees at every level and providing them with opportunities to advance their careers. We also are committed to embracing diversity and providing an inclusive environment where employees can thrive. A focus on diversity among individuals and teams helps to unleash ideas and fuel innovation, which drives growth and economic value throughout our global organization. A healthy and sustainable business also depends on thriving communities. Ball s commitment to the communities where we live and operate is an integral part of our corporate culture, as we continue to support organizations, programs and civic initiatives that advance sustainable livelihoods. Community engagement is how our company and our employees enrich the places where we live and work beyond providing jobs, benefits and paying local taxes. Through the Ball Foundation, corporate giving, employee giving and volunteerism, we invest in the future of the communities that sustain us. In 2022 Ball and its employees donated over 8 million supporting more than 2,800 non-profit organizations and logged more than 30,000 hours of volunteer service to non-profit organizations centered on building sustainable communities through recycling, education, and disaster preparedness and relief initiatives. The company s focus towards sustainability has been recognized by external organizations. For the fourth year in a row, Ball received an A- score in CDP s climate change program. In addition, Ball maintained a MSCI AA ESG rating, was included on the 2022 Dow Jones Sustainability Index, and was recognized as one of America s Most Responsible Companies by Newsweek. Human Capital and Employees Ball Corporation s people are its greatest asset and we are proud to outline the material aspects of our human capital program. At the end of 2022, the company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 21,000 employees, including approximately 10,300 employees in the U.S. Details of collective bargaining agreements are included within Item 1A, Risk Factors of this annual report. Our Culture Embracing our rich 143-year history, we know who we are, a company that respects and values each of our employees and their collective desire to deliver value to all our stakeholders. We embrace our diversity and are one Ball in valuing: Uncompromising integrity; Being close to our customers; Behaving like owners; Focusing on attention to detail; and Being innovative. 
 Diversity and Inclusion Diversity and Inclusion (D I) is embedded in our Drive for 10 vision and is key to the sustained success of our business. We established a dedicated D I function in 2015 to build on our longstanding commitment to D I across the company and included D I as an integral part of our goals for sustainability. Over the past seven years, we have made meaningful

 progress on D I, which has been recognized by external organizations, including Forbes, which recognized Ball among America s Best Employers for Diversity in 2019, the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD), which recognized Ball as a best place to work for disability inclusion on the 2022 Disability Equality Index, and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, which listed Ball among the Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality in five out of the last six years, including a perfect score on its Corporate Equality Index list in 2021 and 2022. Our dedicated D I function reports directly to our Chief Human Resources Officer, and we understand that the key to success is shared accountability rather than designating a single owner for this critical area. Our focus to date has been on providing unconscious bias training for our global workforce, continuing to expand our Ball Network and Interest Groups (BNIs) in terms of quantity and geography and increasing awareness about the importance of D I and each employee s role in ensuring that we have a culture where people can bring their authentic selves to work and thrive. While we are proud of our progress, we know there is more work to do. As we move forward, we are accelerating our D I efforts with a sense of urgency. In June 2020, we instituted a new global cloud-based human capital management platform that has among many other talent-focused features enabled us to more fully understand employee demographics and identify how we can better enhance our diversity around the world. Going into 2023, we plan to introduce tools for inclusion in our learning management system to enhance the unconscious bias training we provide to our global workforce. We will also enhance the purpose and mission of our BNIs to better serve overall business objectives and will be preparing to launch an Inclusion Council led by our Vice President of Diversity and Inclusion and sponsored by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Human Resources Officer. We continue to evolve our talent acquisition process and focus on diversity for internships, candidate slates, interview panels, talent reviews and succession planning. Each of our business segment leaders has committed to help drive further D I progress during 2023 and beyond. Currently, 67 percent of our board of directors is either gender or ethnically diverse, including five female board members, and 44 percent of our company s executive leadership team is either gender or ethnically diverse. Talent We seek to attract, develop and retain the best talent throughout the company. During the past decade, we established and expanded our talent management organization with dedicated talent acquisition and development functions that have implemented rigorous hiring and development processes, including standardized assessments for candidate selection, and an embedded Inspire, Connect, Achieve leadership framework, which details clear behaviors that we expect from our people leaders to ensure they align with our culture. We have also strengthened our succession planning through a holistic approach to developing key managers that includes challenging assignments, formal development plans and professional coaching. Training and Development Our global human capital management platform enables rigorous identification, analysis and development of talent around the world. In conjunction with that platform, the company utilizes an approach to performance management focused on development and continuous improvement. This approach emphasizes ongoing performance conversations between managers and employees and a focus on mitigating bias in performance conversations, resulting in an enhanced employee developmental experience and data points for our talent discussions. Additionally, all employees have access to create a personal development plan and we have resources to support employees in their personal and professional development, including: Continuous education through various tuition reimbursement programs, apprenticeship and instructional programs; A learning management platform that has had significant employee utilization; Monthly global leadership panel discussions and breakout groups focused on real-time topics, such as supporting team wellbeing, working through stressful times, setting individual development goals, maximizing team performance, sharing practical steps to better enable our collective focus on D I and sharing other best practice leadership behaviors; A new LinkedIn Learning platform for all corporate and packaging employees who work in an office setting; Leadership and personal development coaching opportunities by teaming with BetterUp; On-going education for people leaders around our Inspire, Connect, and Achieve leadership behaviors; and Annual compliance, antitrust, bribery, corruption and business code of conduct and ethics training for key management level, sales and supply chain employees.

 Employee Engagement As part of our Drive for 10 vision, we seek to ensure that everyone at Ball is motivated to perform their best work every day. To further that objective, our engagement approach focuses on clear communication and recognition. We communicate through quarterly employee town hall meetings, at both the corporate and operating division levels, with business and market updates and information on production, safety, quality and other operating metrics. We also communicate company information through news releases, executive communications, digital signage and our weekly Ball eNews through the new BallConnect intranet, which are available to all employees. We have many recognition-oriented awards throughout our company, including our corporate and divisional awards of excellence, the Living Well Cup and global operations plant sustainability awards. We conduct regular company-wide engagement surveys, as well as periodic pulse surveys, which have generally indicated high levels of engagement and trust in Ball s leadership, key strategies and initiatives. Total Rewards We have steadily upgraded our total rewards function over the past decade with the ongoing objective of acquiring, rewarding and retaining the best talent by providing total rewards that are competitive and performance based. Our compensation programs, including our long-standing EVA based incentive plans, reflect our commitment to a pay-for-performance philosophy that drives shareholder value. Total direct compensation is positioned in a competitive range of the applicable market median in each jurisdiction, differentiated based on tenure, skills and performance, and designed to attract and retain the best talent. Health, Safety and Wellness The health, safety and wellness of all employees is a top priority at Ball. Our environmental, health and safety function and our operations executives partner to consistently reinforce policies and procedures that are designed to reduce workplace risks and ensure safe methods of plant production, including through regular training and reporting on injuries and lost-time incidents. Over the past 15 years, we have sponsored a variety of health and wellness programs designed to enhance the physical and mental well-being of our employees around the world. During 2020, the company expanded access to its existing Employee Assistance Program (EAP) to our entire global workforce. The EAP provides employees and their families access to mental health, stress management and other support resources essential to navigating life changes and challenges. Additional information on our human capital programs can be found in the Ball Corporation Combined Report, which is available at www.ball.com/sustainability. Our Reportable Segments Ball Corporation reports its financial performance in four reportable segments: (1) beverage packaging, North and Central America; (2) beverage packaging, Europe, Middle East and Africa (beverage packaging, EMEA); (3) beverage packaging, South America and (4) aerospace. Ball also has investments in the U.S., Guatemala, Panama and Vietnam that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and, accordingly, those results are not included in segment sales or earnings. Additional financial information related to each of our segments is included in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (annual report). Beverage Packaging, North and Central America, Segment Beverage packaging, North and Central America, is Ball s largest segment, accounting for 44 percent of consolidated net sales in 2022. Aluminum beverage containers are primarily sold under multi-year supply contracts to fillers of carbonated soft drinks, beer, energy drinks and other beverages. Aluminum beverage containers and ends are produced at 18 manufacturing facilities in the U.S., one in Canada and two in Mexico. The beverage packaging, North and Central America, segment also includes interests in three investments that are accounted for using the equity method. In the third quarter of 2022, Ball announced the permanent closure of its aluminum beverage can manufacturing facilities in Phoenix, Arizona, and St. Paul, Minnesota. The Phoenix facility ceased production in the fourth quarter of 2022, and the St. Paul facility ceased production in the first quarter of 2023.

 According to publicly available information and company estimates, the North American beverage container industry represents approximately 140 billion units. Five companies manufacture substantially all of the aluminum beverage containers in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Ball shipped approximately 52 billion aluminum beverage containers in North and Central America in 2022, which represented approximately 37 percent of the aggregate shipments in these countries. Historically, sales volumes of metal beverage containers in North America tend to be highest during the period from April through September. All of the beverage containers produced by Ball in the U.S., Canada and Mexico are made of aluminum. In North and Central America, a diverse base of no fewer than ten global suppliers provide almost all of our aluminum can and end sheet requirements . Beverage containers are sold based on price, quality, service, innovation and sustainability in a highly competitive market, which is relatively capital intensive and characterized by facilities that run more or less continuously in order to operate profitably. In addition, the aluminum beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials which include meaningful industry positions by the glass bottle in the packaged beer industry and the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle in the carbonated soft drink and water industries. We limit our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum as a result of the inclusion of provisions in most of our aluminum beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum price changes, as well as through the use of derivative instruments. Beverage Packaging, EMEA, Segment The beverage packaging, EMEA, segment accounted for 25 percent of Ball s consolidated net sales in 2022. Our EMEA region operations include 17 facilities throughout Europe and one facility each in Cairo, Egypt, and Manisa, Turkey. In the third quarter of 2022, Ball completed the sale of its aluminum beverage packaging business located in Russia, which included three aluminum beverage can manufacturing facilities. For the countries in which we currently operate, not including Russia, the beverage container market is approximately 90 billion containers, and we are the largest producer with an estimated 39 percent of shipments in this region. The regions served by our beverage packaging, EMEA, segment, including Egypt and Turkey, are highly regional in terms of sales growth rates and packaging mix. Four companies manufacture substantially all of the metal beverage containers in EMEA. Our EMEA beverage facilities, not including Russia, shipped 35 billion beverage containers in 2022, all of which were made from aluminum. The company has announced plans to construct additional plants in Pilsen, Czech Republic, and Northamptonshire, U.K. Both facilities are expected to begin production in the first half of 2023. Historically, sales volumes of metal beverage containers in EMEA tend to be highest during the period from May through August, with a smaller increase in demand leading up to the winter holiday season in the U.K. Much like in other parts of the world, the aluminum beverage container competes aggressively with other packaging materials used by the beer and carbonated soft drink industries. The glass bottle is heavily utilized in the packaged beer industry, while the PET container is utilized in the carbonated soft drink, beer, juice and water industries. These trends are evolving, however, as customers, regulators and non-governmental organizations continue to press for more sustainable packaging in the wake of the global pollution crisis. More and more brands are choosing aluminum beverage packaging because of its infinite recyclability and other sustainability credentials. Using a new calculation implemented by the European Union (EU) in 2022, the overall recycling rate for aluminum beverage cans in the EU, Switzerland, Norway and Iceland was approximately 73 percent in 2020. Raw material supply contracts in this region generally have longer term agreements. Six aluminum suppliers provide almost all of our aluminum can and end sheet requirements. The company minimizes its exchange rate risk using derivative and supply contracts in local currencies. We limit our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum as a result of the inclusion of provisions in our aluminum beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum price changes, as well as through the use of derivative instruments.

 Beverage Packaging, South America, Segment The beverage packaging, South America, segment accounted for 14 percent of Ball s consolidated net sales in 2022. Our operations consist of 12 facilities 9 in Brazil and one each in Argentina, Chile and Paraguay. In the third quarter, Ball permanently ceased operations at its aluminum beverage can manufacturing facility in Santa Cruz, Brazil, and temporarily reduced production across its remaining Brazilian beverage can manufacturing footprint. For the countries where we operate, the South American beverage container market is approximately 40 billion containers, and we are the largest producer in this region with an estimated 46 percent of South American shipments in 2022. Four companies currently manufacture substantially all of the aluminum beverage containers in Brazil. The company s South American beverage facilities shipped approximately 19 billion aluminum beverage containers in 2022. Historically, sales volumes of beverage containers in South America tend to be highest during the period from September through December. In South America, two suppliers provide virtually all our aluminum can and end sheet requirements with certain requirements also being imported from Asia. We limit our exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum as a result of the inclusion of provisions in our aluminum beverage container sales contracts to pass through aluminum price changes, as well as through the use of derivative instruments. Aerospace Segment Ball s aerospace segment, which accounted for 13 percent of consolidated net sales in 2022, includes national defense hardware, antenna and video tactical solutions, civil and operational space hardware and systems engineering services. The segment develops spacecraft, sensors and instruments, radio frequency systems and other advanced technologies for the civil, commercial and national security aerospace markets. The majority of the aerospace business involves work under contracts, generally from one to five years in duration, as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and other U.S. government agencies. The company competes against both large and small prime contractors and subcontractors for these contracts. Contracts funded by the various agencies of the federal government represented 98 percent of segment sales in 2022. Intense competition and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both the company s business and the aerospace and defense industry. It is common in the aerospace and defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies. A company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract to a competitor, become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company. It is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and, simultaneously, perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts, or vice versa. Geopolitical events and shifting executive and legislative branch priorities have resulted in an increase in opportunities over the past decade in areas matching our aerospace segment s core capabilities in space hardware. The businesses include hardware and services sold primarily to U.S. customers, with emphasis on space science and exploration, climate monitoring, weather prediction, environmental and earth sciences, and defense and intelligence applications. Major activities frequently involve the design, manufacture and testing of satellites, remote sensors and ground station control hardware and software, as well as related services such as launch vehicle integration and satellite operations. Other hardware activities include target identification, warning and attitude control systems and components; cryogenic systems for reactant storage, and associated sensor cooling devices; star trackers, which are general-purpose stellar attitude sensors; and fast-steering mirrors.

 Backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on performance obligations to our customers for which work remains to be performed. Backlog in the aerospace segment was 2.97 billion and 2.47 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and consisted of the aggregate contract value of firm orders, excluding amounts previously recognized as revenue. The 2022 backlog includes 1.52 billion expected to be recognized in revenues during 2023, with the remainder expected to be recognized in revenues in the years thereafter. Amounts included in backlog for certain firm government orders, which are subject to annual funding, were 1.61 billion and 1.05 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Year-over-year comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations, revenues and earnings due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts, funding of programs and the uncertainty of timing of future contract awards. Uncertainties in the federal government budgeting process could delay the funding, or even result in cancellation of certain programs currently in our reported backlog. Other Other consists of a non-reportable operating segment (beverage packaging, other) that manufactures and sells aluminum beverage containers in India, Saudi Arabia and Myanmar; a non-reportable operating segment that manufactures and sells extruded aluminum aerosol containers, recloseable aluminum bottles across multiple consumer categories and slugs (aerosol packaging); a non-reportable operating segment that manufactures and sells aluminum cups (aluminum cups); undistributed corporate expenses; intercompany eliminations and other business activities. Beverage Packaging, Other Our aluminum beverage packaging operations in the beverage packaging, other, segment consist of four facilities two in India and one each in Saudi Arabia and Myanmar. Our aluminum can and end sheet requirements are provided by several suppliers. Our manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia, Ball United Arab Can Manufacturing Company, is an investment 51 percent owned by Ball and consolidated in our results. Additionally, Ball has ownership interests in an equity method investment in Vietnam. During 2021, Ball sold its minority-owned investment in South Korea. For additional details, refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report Aerosol Packaging Our aluminum aerosol packaging operations manufacture and sell extruded aluminum aerosol containers, recloseable aluminum bottles across multiple consumer categories and aluminum slugs, which represented less than 5 percent of Ball s consolidated net sales in 2022. There are 9 manufacturing facilities that manufacture these products four in Europe and one each in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Mexico and India. The aerosol packaging market in these countries shipped approximately 6.6 billion aluminum aerosol units in 2022 and we are one of the major producers in this combined area with shipments of 1.4 billion aluminum aerosol packaging containers, representing approximately 21 percent of total shipments in these markets. Our aluminum aerosol requirements are provided by several suppliers. In 2021, our aerosol business operations launched a new extruded, recloseable aluminum bottle line to provide a circular solution to plastic bottle pollution in personal care and other product categories. Aluminum Cups The Ball aluminum cups business serves the growing demand for innovative, sustainable beverage packaging among customers and consumers. Aligned with our Drive for 10 vision, the aluminum cups business leverages our years of experience and specialized expertise to provide another environmentally friendly offering to our industry-leading portfolio of aluminum packages. Sturdy, durable and cool to the touch, the infinitely recyclable Ball aluminum cup is produced at a dedicated manufacturing facility in Rome, Georgia. Ball plans to introduce additional offerings to round out its cups portfolio and intends to expand adoption of the cups to drinking establishments, parks and recreation, colleges and universities, hospitality, restaurants, retail, business and industry. Patents In the opinion of the company s management, none of our active patents or groups of patents is material to the successful operation of our business as a whole. We manage our intellectual property portfolio to obtain the durations necessary to achieve our business objectives.

 General Risks If we do not effectively manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected. Our future revenue and operating results will depend on our ability to effectively manage the anticipated growth of our business. We have experienced fluctuations in the growth in demand for our products and services in recent years and are rebalancing our operations, managing our headcount and developing new and innovative product offerings to balance our supply positions with our customers requirements in each region. These circumstances have placed significant demands on our management as well as our financial and operational resources, and present several challenges, including: rebalancing manufacturing capacity, maintaining quality and optimizing production; identifying, attracting and retaining qualified personnel; developing and retaining our global sales, marketing and administrative infrastructure and capabilities; increasing our regulatory compliance capabilities, particularly in new lines of business; optimizing our expertise in a number of disciplines, including marketing, licensing, and merchandising; and implementing appropriate operational, financial and IT systems and internal controls. Our business, operating results and financial condition are subject to particular risks in certain regions of the world. We may experience an operating loss in one or more regions of the world for one or more periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. Moreover, overcapacity, which often leads to lower prices, may develop over time in certain regions in which we operate even if demand continues to grow. More generally, supply and demand fluctuations could make it difficult for us to forecast and meet certain customers needs. Our ability to manage such operational fluctuations and to maintain adequate long-term strategies in the face of such developments will be critical to our continued growth and profitability. The loss of a key customer, or a reduction in its requirements, could have a significant negative impact on our sales. We sell a majority of our packaging products to a relatively limited number of major beverage, personal care and household product companies, some of which operate in multiple geographical markets we serve. Although the majority of our customer contracts are long-term, these contracts, unless they are renewed, expire in accordance with their respective terms and are terminable under certain circumstances, such as our failure to meet quality, volume or market pricing requirements. Because we depend on a relatively limited number of major customers, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of any of these customers, a reduction in the purchasing levels of these customers, a strike or work stoppage by a significant number of these customers employees or an adverse change in the terms of the supply agreements with these customers. The primary customers for our aerospace segment are U.S. government agencies or their prime contractors. Our contracts with these customers are subject to several risks, including funding cuts and delays, technical uncertainties, budget changes, government shutdowns, competitive activity and changes in scope.

 We have a significant level of debt that could have important consequences for our business and any investment in our securities. The company had 9.00 billion of interest-bearing debt at December 31, 2022. Such indebtedness could have significant consequences for our business and any investment in our securities, including: increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments; requiring more of our cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thus limiting our cash flow available to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities or the return of cash to our shareholders; restricting us from making additional acquisitions; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be less leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting. We face competitive risks from many sources that may negatively impact our profitability. Competition within the packaging and aerospace industries is intense. Increases in productivity, combined with potential surplus capacity in the industry, have maintained competitive pricing pressures. The principal methods of competition in the general packaging industry are price, innovation, sustainability, service and quality. In the aerospace industry, they are technical capability, cost and schedule. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources, and some may currently have excess capacity. Our current or potential competitors may offer products at a lower price or products that are deemed superior to ours. The global economic environment has resulted in reductions in demand for our products in some instances, which, in turn, could increase these competitive pressures. We are subject to competition from alternative products, which could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows. Our aluminum packaging products are subject to significant competition from substitute products, particularly plastic carbonated soft drink bottles made from PET, single serve and returnable beer bottles and other beverage containers made of glass, cardboard or other materials. Competition from plastic carbonated soft drink bottles is particularly intense in the U.S. and Europe, and competition from glass beer bottles has recently increased in Brazil. Certain of our aerospace products are also subject to competition from alternative products and solutions. There can be no assurance that our products will successfully compete against alternative products, which could result in a reduction in our profits or cash flows. Our packaging businesses have a narrow product range, and our business would suffer if usage of our products decreased or if decreases occur in the demand for the beverages and other goods filled in our products. The majority of our consolidated net sales were from the sale of beverage containers, and we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues and cash flows from the sale of beverage containers. Our business would suffer if the use of beverage containers decreased. Accordingly, broad acceptance by consumers of aluminum containers for a wide variety of beverages is critical to our future success. If demand for glass and PET bottles increases relative to aluminum containers, or the demand for aluminum containers does not develop as expected, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

 Our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations are subject to risks resulting from broader geographic operations. We derived approximately 45 percent of our consolidated net sales from outside of the U.S. for the year ended December 31, 2022. The sizeable scope of operations inside and outside of the U.S. may lead to more volatile financial results and make it more difficult for us to manage our business. Reasons for this include, but are not limited to, the following: political and economic instability; governments restrictive trade policies; the imposition or rescission of duties, taxes or government royalties; exchange rate risks; inflation of direct input costs; virus and disease outbreaks and responses thereto; difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property rights; and the geographic, language and cultural differences between personnel in different areas of the world. We are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. The company s financial results are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations and a significant proportion of assets, liabilities and earnings denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. The company presents its financial statements in U.S. dollars and has a significant proportion of its net assets, debt and income in non-U.S. dollar currencies, primarily the euro, as well as the currencies of Argentina, Egypt, Turkey and other emerging markets. The company s financial results and capital ratios are therefore sensitive to movements in currency exchange rates. We manage our exposure to currency fluctuations, particularly our exposure to fluctuations in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate to attempt to mitigate the effect of cash flow and earnings volatility associated with exchange rate changes. We primarily use derivative instruments to manage our currency exposures and, as a result, we experience gains and losses on these derivative positions which are offset, in part, by the impact of currency fluctuations on existing assets and liabilities. We are vulnerable to fluctuations and disruptions in the supply and price of raw materials. We purchase aluminum and other raw materials and packaging supplies, including dunnage, from several sources. While all such materials and supplies are available from independent suppliers, they are subject to fluctuations in price and availability attributable to a number of factors, including general economic conditions, commodity price fluctuations (particularly aluminum on the London Metal Exchange), the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the availability of complementary and substitute materials. Although we enter into commodities purchase agreements from time to time and sometimes use derivative instruments to seek to manage our risk, we cannot ensure that our current suppliers of raw materials will be able to supply us with sufficient quantities at reasonable prices. Economic, financial, and operational factors, including strikes or labor shortages, as well as governmental action, could impact our suppliers, thereby causing supply shortages. Increases in raw material costs, including potential increases due to tariffs, sanctions, or other trade actions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Global supply chain disruptions can negatively impact our results. In the Americas, Europe and Asia, some contracts do not allow us to pass along increased raw material costs and we generally use derivative agreements to seek to manage this risk. Our hedging procedures may be insufficient and our results could be materially impacted if costs of materials increase. Due to the fixed-price contracts, increased prices could decrease our sales volume over time. The delayed timing in recovering the pass-through of increasing raw material costs may also impact our short-term profitability and certain costs due to price increases or supply chain inefficiencies may be unrecoverable, which would also impact our profitability. In addition, in view of recent increases in our raw material and other production costs, we initiated a comprehensive cost pass-through program across all our businesses beginning in the second half of 2021, which is ongoing, to seek to recover from our customers the full amount of those cost increases over time.

 We use estimates in accounting for many of our programs in our aerospace business, and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results. We account for sales and profits on a portion of long-term contracts in our aerospace business in accordance with the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, using the cost-to-cost method to account for updates in estimates. The percentage-of-completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project revenues and costs at completion and various assumptions and projections related to the outcome of future events, including the quantity and timing of product deliveries, future labor performance and rates, and material and overhead costs. These assumptions involve various levels of expected performance improvements. Under the cost-to-cost method, the impact of updates in our estimates related to units shipped to date or progress made to date is recognized immediately. Given the significance of the judgments and estimates described above, it is likely that we could record materially different amounts if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances or estimates were to change. Our backlog includes both cost-type and fixed-price contracts. Cost-type contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Our earnings and margins may vary depending on the types of government contracts undertaken, the nature of the work performed under those contracts, the costs incurred in performing the work, the achievement of other performance objectives and their impact on our ability to receive fees. The fixed-price contracts could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Net earnings and net assets could be materially affected by an impairment of goodwill. We have a significant amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. We are required at least annually to test the recoverability of goodwill. The recoverability test of goodwill is based on the current fair value of our identified reporting units. Fair value measurement requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors, including revenue and market growth, operating cash flows and discount rates. If general market conditions deteriorate in portions of our business, we could experience a significant decline in the fair value of our reporting units. This decline could lead to an impairment of all or a significant portion of the goodwill balance, which could materially affect our U.S. GAAP net earnings and net assets. If the investments in Ball s pension plans, or in the multi-employer pension plans in which Ball participates, do not perform as expected, we may have to contribute additional amounts to the plans, which would otherwise be available for other general corporate purposes. Ball maintains defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its employees in the United States and a significant number of United Kingdom deferred and retired participants, which are funded based on certain actuarial assumptions. The plans assets consist primarily of common stocks, fixed-income securities and, in the U.S., alternative investments. Market declines, longevity increases or legislative changes, such as the Pension Protection Act in the U.S., could result in a prospective decrease in our available cash flow and net earnings over time, and the recognition of an increase in our pension obligations could result in a reduction to our shareholders equity. Additional risks exist related to the company s participation in multi-employer pension plans. Assets contributed to a multi-employer pension plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. If a participating employer in a multi-employer pension plan stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participants. This could result in increases to our contributions to the plans as well as pension expense.

 Restricted access to capital markets could adversely affect our short-term liquidity and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes issued pursuant to our bond indentures. A reduction in global market liquidity could: restrict our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other business activities; increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including the credit risks stemming from the economic environment; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate; restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities; and limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay cash dividends or refinance debt maturities. If market interest rates increase, our variable-rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which adversely affects our cash flows. While we sometimes enter into agreements limiting our exposure, any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk. The global credit, financial and economic environment could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The overall credit, financial and economic environment could have significant negative effects on our operations, including: the creditworthiness of customers, suppliers and counterparties could deteriorate resulting in a financial loss or a disruption in our supply of raw materials; volatile market performance could affect the fair value of our pension assets, potentially requiring us to make significant additional contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to maintain prescribed funding levels; a significant weakening of our financial position or operating results could result in noncompliance with our debt covenants; and reduced cash flows from our operations could adversely affect our ability to execute our long-term strategy to increase liquidity, reduce debt, repurchase our stock and invest in our businesses. Changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and SEC rules and regulations could materially impact our reported results. U.S. GAAP and SEC accounting and reporting changes are common. These changes could have significant effects on our reported results when compared to prior periods and other companies and may even require us to retrospectively adjust prior periods. Additionally, material changes to the presentation of transactions in the consolidated financial statements could impact key ratios that investors, analysts and credit rating agencies use to assess or rate Ball s performance and could ultimately impact our ability to access the credit markets in an efficient manner. A material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If a material weakness is identified, management could conclude that internal control over financial reporting is not effective based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control An Integrated Framework (2013). If a material weakness is identified, a remediation plan would be designed to address the material weakness. If remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses in internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results. As of December 31, 2022, the company had no material weaknesses.

 We face risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which could adversely affect our business. The circumstances of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and responses thereto continue to evolve. The products produced and services provided by Ball have been deemed essential and, as a result, relevant governments around the world have allowed our operations to continue through the pandemic. COVID-19 and its related variants, or another different future pandemic, could give rise to circumstances that cause one or more of the following risk factors to occur: We could lose key customers, customers could become insolvent or have a reduction in demand for our products and services; We could be subject to changes in laws and governmental regulations that adversely affect our business and operations; We could be subject to adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates; We might lose key management and operating personnel; We may be subject to disruptions in the supply or price of our raw materials; We may face prolonged work stoppages at our facilities; We may be impacted by government budget constraints or government shutdowns; Our pension plan investments may not perform as expected, and we may be required to make additional contributions to our pension plans which would otherwise be available for other general corporate purposes; Our access to capital markets may be restricted, which could adversely affect our short-term liquidity and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes issued pursuant to our bond indentures; We may be subject to increased information technology (IT) security threats and reduced network access availability; Our operations and those of our principal customers and suppliers could be designated as non-essential in key markets; and A material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting or a material misstatement in our financial statements could occur. Because the COVID-19 pandemic is far-reaching and its impacts cannot be completely anticipated, additional risks may arise that could materially impact the company s financial results and liquidity. The company has or may implement actions to minimize the risks and associated negative effects from COVID-19, which do not guarantee the prevention or mitigation of material impacts on our business. Some of these actions may include, and are not limited to: Implementing alternative work arrangements including work from home; Limiting or eliminating work-related travel; Effecting a full or partial shut-down of operations; Enhancing the cleaning and disinfecting of our physical locations; Implementing health screening for employees and third parties who enter our facilities; Adjusting inventory levels to mitigate potential supply disruptions; Modifying payment terms with customers; Providing additional health-related services to our employees; Reducing compensation for our employees; Reducing our workforce levels; Modifying our debt arrangements; and Adjusting contributions to defined benefit pension plans or income tax payments.

 Governmental and regulatory risks Changes in laws and governmental regulations may adversely affect our business and operations. We and our customers and suppliers are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, which have been increasing in number and complexity. Each of our, and their, facilities is subject to federal, state, provincial and local licensing and regulation by health, environmental, workplace safety and other agencies in multiple jurisdictions. Requirements of worldwide governmental authorities with respect to manufacturing, manufacturing facility locations within the jurisdiction, product content and safety, climate change, workplace safety and health, environmental, expropriation of assets and other standards could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products, and the ability of our customers and suppliers to manufacture and sell their products. In addition, we face risks arising from compliance with and enforcement of numerous and complex federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations. Enacted regulatory developments regarding the reporting and use of conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing, availability and price of minerals used in the manufacture of certain of our products. As a result, there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict-free materials, and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to obtain such products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, because our supply chains are complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all materials used in the products that we sell. The compliance and reporting aspects of these regulations may result in incremental costs to the company. While deposit systems and other container-related legislation have been adopted in some jurisdictions, similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies in many others. We anticipate that continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation in the future. The packages we produce are widely used and perform well in U.S. states, Canadian provinces and European countries that have deposit systems, as well as in other countries worldwide. While deposit systems and other container-related legislation have been adopted in some jurisdictions, similar legislation has been defeated in public referenda and legislative bodies in many others. We anticipate that continuing efforts will be made to consider and adopt such legislation in the future. The packages we produce are widely used and perform well in U.S. states, Canadian provinces and European countries that have deposit systems, as well as in other countries worldwide. Significant environmental, employment-related and other legislation and regulatory requirements exist and are also evolving. The compliance costs associated with current and proposed laws and potential regulations could be substantial, and any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws or regulations could lead to litigation or governmental action, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Our aerospace segment is subject to certain risks specific to that business. In our aerospace business, U.S. government contracts are subject to reduction or modification in the event of changes in requirements, and the government may also terminate contracts at its convenience pursuant to standard termination provisions. In such instances, Ball may be entitled to reimbursement for allowable costs and profits on authorized work that has been performed through the date of termination. In addition, budgetary constraints and government shutdowns may result in further reductions to projected spending levels by the U.S. government. In particular, government expenditures are subject to the potential for automatic reductions, generally referred to as sequestration. Sequestration may occur in any given year, resulting in significant additional reductions to spending by various U.S. government defense and aerospace agencies on both existing and new contracts, as well as the disruption of ongoing programs. Even if sequestration does not occur, we expect that budgetary constraints and ongoing concerns regarding the U.S. national debt will continue to place downward pressure on agency spending levels. Due to these and other factors, overall spending on various programs could decline, which could result in significant reductions to revenue, cash flows, net earnings and backlog primarily in our aerospace segment.

 As a U.S. government contractor, we could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or any negative findings from a U.S. government audit or investigation. Our aerospace business operates in a highly regulated environment and is routinely audited and reviewed by the U.S. government and its agencies, such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). These agencies review performance under our contracts, our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards, as well as the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies. Business systems that are subject to review under the DoD Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) are purchasing, estimating, material management and accounting, as well as property and earned value management. Any costs ultimately found to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, sanctions or suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. Whether or not illegal activities are alleged, the U.S. government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate. If such actions were to result in suspension or debarment, this could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business faces the potential of increased regulation on some of the raw materials utilized in our packaging operations. Our operations are subject to federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions relating to some of the raw materials, including epoxy-based coatings utilized in our container making process. Epoxy-based coatings may contain Bisphenol-A (BPA). Scientific evidence evaluated by regulatory agencies in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand has consistently shown these coatings to be safe for food contact at current levels, and these regulatory agencies have stated that human exposure to BPA from epoxy-based container coatings is well below safe exposure limits set by government bodies worldwide. A significant change in these regulatory agency statements, adverse information concerning BPA or other chemicals present in our coatings, or rulings made within certain federal, state, provincial and local jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Ball recognizes that significant interest exists in non-epoxy based coatings, and we have been proactively working with coatings suppliers and our customers to transition to alternative coatings. In addition, various U.S. states have passed or are contemplating legislation restricting, and the EU is reviewing a proposal to restrict, the use of materials that contain intentionally added per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which may require the company to continue to incur costs to convert existing coatings to accommodate PFAS-free coatings. To mitigate these risks, the Company is working with its suppliers to require them to remove PFAS-containing coatings from our products. Earnings and cash flows can be impacted by changes in tax laws. As a U.S.-based multinational business, the company is subject to income tax in the U.S. and numerous jurisdictions outside the U.S., including recent OECD, European Commission and other trans-national initiatives that seek to impose minimum tax thresholds on most multi-national companies. The relevant tax rules and regulations are complex, often changing and, in some cases, are interdependent. If these or other tax rules and regulations should change, the company s earnings and cash flows could be impacted. The company s worldwide provision for income taxes is determined, in part, through the use of significant estimates and judgments. Numerous transactions arise in the ordinary course of business where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The company undergoes tax examinations by various worldwide tax authorities on a regular basis. While the company believes its estimates of its tax obligations are reasonable, the final outcome after the conclusion of any tax examinations and any litigation could be materially different from what has been reflected in the company s historical financial statements.

 Technological risks Decreases in our ability to develop or apply new technology and know-how may affect our competitiveness. Our success depends partially on our ability to improve production processes and services. We must also introduce new products and services to meet changing customer needs. If we are unable to implement better production processes or to develop new products through research and development or licensing of new technology, we may not be able to remain competitive with other manufacturers. As a result, our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be adversely affected. Increased information technology (IT) security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions and services, as well as those of our suppliers and customers. The company s IT systems, or any third party s system on which the company relies, as well as those of our suppliers and customers, could fail on their own accord or may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions or shutdowns, including interruptions or shutdowns due to natural disasters, power outages or telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks or failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software or hardware. Increased global IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime also pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data, as well as to the security and data of our suppliers and customers. As a provider of products and services to government and commercial customers, our aerospace business in particular may be the target of cyber-attacks, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to classified or sensitive information and networks. The company has a number of shared service centers where many of the company s IT systems are concentrated and any disruption at such a location could impact the company s business within the operating zones served by the impacted service center. Certain IT-related risks may be heightened due to the transitional support we are providing to the Russian beverage packaging business since its sale to Russian owners in September 2022. While we attempt to mitigate all of these risks to our networks, systems and data by employing a number of measures, including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats or other IT disruptions. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, harm to individuals or property, contractual or regulatory actions and fines, penalties and potential liabilities, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. Data privacy and protection laws are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges, which may increase our costs, affect our competitiveness and could expose us to substantial fines or other penalties. In addition, a security breach that involves classified or other sensitive government information could subject us to civil or criminal penalties and could result in the loss of our secure facility clearance and other accreditation, loss of our government contracts, loss of access to classified information or debarment as a government contractor. Human capital risks If we fail to retain key management and personnel, we may be unable to implement our key objectives. We believe our future success depends, in part, on our experienced management team. Unforeseen losses of key members of our management team without appropriate succession and/or compensation planning could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet our objectives. Prolonged work stoppages at facilities with union employees could jeopardize our financial position. As of December 31, 2022, 9 percent of our North American employees and 38 percent of our European employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. These collective bargaining agreements have staggered expirations during the next several years. Although we consider our employee relations to be generally good, a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any facility with union employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. In addition, we cannot ensure that upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements, new agreements will be reached without union action or that any such new agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us.

 Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (annual report), which include additional information about our accounting policies, practices and the transactions underlying our financial results. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, taxes, environmental and other matters arising during the normal course of business. We apply our best judgment, our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ from these estimates. Ball Corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as Ball Corporation, Ball, the company, we or our in the following discussion and analysis. OVERVIEW Business Overview and Industry Trends Ball Corporation is one of the world s leading aluminum packaging suppliers. Our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses, are manufactured in facilities around the world and are competitive with other substrates, such as plastics and glass. In the aluminum packaging industry, sales and earnings can be increased by reducing costs, increasing prices, developing new products, expanding volumes and making strategic acquisitions. We also provide aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers, including national defense hardware, antenna and video tactical solutions, civil and operational space hardware and system engineering services. We sell our aluminum packaging products mainly to large, multinational beverage, personal care and household products companies with which we have developed long-term relationships. This is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long-term supply contracts. While we have a diversified customer base, we sell a significant portion of our packaging products to major companies and brands, as well as to numerous regional customers. The overall global aluminum beverage and aerosol container industries are growing and are expected to continue to grow in the medium to long term. The primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace segment are U.S. government agencies or their prime contractors. We purchase our raw materials from relatively few suppliers. We also have exposure to inflation, in particular the rising costs of raw materials, as well as other direct cost inputs. We mitigate our exposure to the changes in the costs of aluminum through the inclusion of provisions in contracts covering the majority of our volumes to pass through aluminum price changes, as well as through the use of derivative instruments. The pass-through provisions generally result in proportional increases or decreases in sales and costs with a greatly reduced impact, if any, on net earnings; however, there may be timing differences of when the costs are passed through . Because of our customer and supplier concentration, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss, insolvency or bankruptcy of a major customer or supplier or a change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier, although our contract provisions generally mitigate the risk of customer loss, and our long-term relationships represent a known, stable customer base. The majority of our aerospace business involves work under contracts, generally from one to five years in duration, as a prime contractor or subcontractor for various U.S. government agencies. Intense competition and long operating cycles are key characteristics of the company s aerospace and defense industry where it is common for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies. A company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract to a competitor, become a subcontractor for the ultimate prime contracting company.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management s discussion and analysis for our results of operations on a consolidated and segment basis include a quantification of factors that had a material impact. Other factors that did not have a material impact, but that are significant to understand the results, are qualitatively described. Refer to Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, as filed on February 16, 2021, for a comparison of our 2021 results of operations to the 2020 results. Global Economic Environment In 2022 data indicated a sharp rise in inflation in the regions where we operate. Current and future inflationary effects may continue to be impacted by, among other things, supply chain disruptions, governmental stimulus or fiscal policies, changes in interest rates, and changing demand for certain goods and services as recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic continues. We cannot predict with any certainty the impact that rising interest rates, a global or any regional recession, or higher inflation may have on our customers or suppliers. Additionally, we are unable to predict the potential effects that any resurgence of COVID-19, its variants or any future pandemic, or the continuation or escalation of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and related sanctions or market disruptions, may have on our business. It remains uncertain how long any of these conditions may last or how severe any of them may become. Consolidated Sales and Earnings Years Ended December 31, in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net sales 15,349 13,811 11,781 Net earnings attributable to Ball Corporation 719 878 585 Net earnings attributable to Ball Corporation as a of net sales 5 6 5 Sales in 2022 were 1,538 million higher compared to 2021 primarily due to the pass through of higher aluminum prices and the delayed recoverability of inflationary costs, partially offset by currency translation. Net earnings attributable to Ball Corporation in 2022 were 159 million lower than 2021 primarily due to increased manufacturing and inflationary costs and net charges from the impairment of Russian long-lived assets and the gain from the sale of Ball s Russian aluminum beverage packaging business, partially offset by the gain on sale of our remaining equity investment in Ball Metalpack, lower pension settlement charges in 2022 than in 2021 and lower depreciation expense. In 2023 we expect to improve year-over-year results through fixed cost savings from rightsizing production and the contractual recovery of 2022 inflationary costs. Cost of Sales (Excluding Depreciation and Amortization) Cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, was 12,766 million in 2022 compared to 11,085 million in 2021. These amounts represented 83 percent and 80 percent of consolidated net sales for the years ended 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase year-over-year is primarily due to higher manufacturing costs, general inflationary cost pressures and global supply chain transportation disruptions. To mitigate these recent cost trends, we have established a commercial cost recovery program that is designed to help us recover a significant portion of those cost increases that fall outside our normal customer contracts. Additionally, we took actions to normalize inventory levels and reduce fixed and variable costs heading into 2023 that we expect will improve financial results. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense was 672 million in 2022 compared to 700 million in 2021. These amounts represented 4 percent and 5 percent of consolidated net sales for the years ended 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amortization expense in 2022 and 2021 included 135 million and 152 million, respectively, for the amortization of acquired Rexam intangibles.The decrease compared to the same period in 2021 is primarily due to revised estimated useful lives of the company s manufacturing equipment, buildings and certain assembly and test equipment, as well as

 the impairment and ultimate sale of the Russia aluminum beverage packaging business. See Note 4 for details regarding the sale of the Russian operations. Effective July 1, 2022, Ball revised the estimated useful lives of all of its equipment and buildings included in the analysis, which resulted in a net reduction in depreciation expense of approximately 49 million 37 million after tax, or 0.12 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the amount of depreciation expense that would have been recognized by utilizing the prior depreciable lives. This change in useful lives is expected to reduce depreciation expense by approximately 49 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, for those assets included in the revision analysis. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses were 626 million in 2022 compared to 593 million in 2021. These amounts represented 4 percent of consolidated net sales for 2022 and 2021. The increase in SG A expenses was primarily due to higher accounts receivable factoring costs, partially offset by lower personnel costs during the fourth quarter. Business Consolidation Costs and Other Activities Business consolidation costs and other activities were 71 million in 2022 compared to 142 million in 2021. These amounts represented less than 1 percent and 1 percent of consolidated net sales for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The amounts in 2022 included impairment losses on Russia s long-lived asset group, the gain on sale of Ball s Russian aluminum beverage packaging business, the gain on sale of Ball s remaining equity method investment in Ball Metalpack, charges related to a Brazilian customer s contract breach, facility shutdown costs, charges for employee severance and benefits related to cost-out activities and a charge related to a donation to the Ball Foundation. The amounts in 2021 included a non-cash pension settlement charge of 135 million and gains resulting from Brazilian indirect tax rulings of 22 million. Further details regarding business consolidation costs and other activities, including the Russian impairment and gain on sale, are provided in Note 10 and Note 4 , respectively. Interest Expense Total interest expense was 330 million in 2022 compared to 283 million in 2021. Interest expense, excluding the effect of debt refinancing and other costs, as a percentage of average borrowings increased by approximately 10 basis points from 3.4 percent in 2021 to 3.5 percent in 2022 due to an increase in global interest rates. Increased debt levels in 2022 compared to 2021 further contributed to higher interest expense for the year. Tax Provision The company s effective tax rate is affected by recurring items such as income earned in non-U.S. jurisdictions with tax rates that differ from the U.S. tax rate and by discrete items that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year. The 2022 effective income tax rate was 18.0 percent compared to 15.5 percent for 2021. As compared with the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of 21 percent, the 2022 effective income tax rate was reduced by 3.2 percent for the impact of the U.S. research and development credit and by 2.8 percent for the impact of non-U.S. rate differences including tax holidays. These reductions were partially offset by an increase of 2.3 percent for U.S. state and local taxes and by 1.6 percent for equity compensation related impacts. While these items are expected to recur, the potential magnitude of each item is uncertain. Further details of taxes on income, including impacts of the U.S. tax reform, are provided in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report.

 RESULTS OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS Segment Results Ball s operations are organized and reviewed by management along its product lines and geographical areas, and its operating results are presented in the four reportable segments discussed below. Beverage Packaging, North and Central America 

Years Ended December 31, in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net sales 6,696 5,856 5,076 Comparable operating earnings 642 681 683 Comparable operating earnings as a of segment net sales 10 12 13 In the third quarter of 2022, Ball announced the permanent closure of its aluminum beverage can manufacturing facilities in Phoenix, Arizona, and St. Paul, Minnesota. The Phoenix facility ceased production in the fourth quarter of 2022, and the St. Paul facility ceased production in the first quarter of 2023. Segment sales in 2022 were 840 million higher compared to 2021 primarily due to the pass through of higher aluminum prices, partially offset by unfavorable price/mix. Comparable operating earnings in 2022 were 39 million lower compared to 2021 primarily due to unfavorable fixed cost absorption, higher inflationary costs and unfavorable customer mix, partially offset by favorable contractual terms, cost pass throughs and lower depreciation expense associated with the third quarter 2022 revision of estimated useful lives. In 2023 we expect to improve year-over-year results through fixed cost savings from rightsizing production and the contractual recovery of 2022 inflationary costs. Beverage Packaging, EMEA Years Ended December 31, in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net sales 3,854 3,509 2,945 Comparable operating earnings 358 452 354 Comparable operating earnings as a of segment net sales 9 13 12 Segment sales in 2022 were 345 million higher compared to 2021 primarily due to the pass through of higher aluminum prices, favorable price/mix and 4 percent volume growth, partially offset by approximately 400 million from unfavorable currency translation and the sale of the Russian aluminum beverage packaging business. Comparable operating earnings in 2022 were 94 million lower compared to 2021 primarily due to approximately 40 million from unfavorable currency translation, the impact of higher inflation, energy costs, supply disruptions across the region and the sale of the Russian aluminum beverage packaging business, partially offset by the pass through of higher aluminum prices, volume growth and lower depreciation expense associated with the third quarter 2022 revision of estimated useful lives. During the third quarter of 2022, and further to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the company sold its Russian business, composed of three manufacturing facilities, for total cash consideration of 530 million. The historical operations and results of the Russian aluminum packaging business, including the gain on sale, are included in the beverage packaging, EMEA segment. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report for additional discussion regarding the sale and its impact to Ball s financial results. A summary of the results of the Russian aluminum packaging business and the non-Russian components of the beverage packaging, EMEA, segment, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, are shown below:

Segment sales in 2022 were 92 million higher compared to 2021 primarily due to the contractual pass through of higher aluminum prices and price/mix, partially offset by 6 percent lower volumes. Comparable operating earnings in 2022 were 73 million lower compared to 2021 primarily due to lower volumes, unfavorable regional customer/product mix and fixed cost absorption in Brazil, partially offset by the contractual pass through of costs and lower depreciation expense associated with the third quarter 2022 revision of estimated useful lives. In 2023 we expect to improve year-over-year financial results through fixed cost savings from rightsizing production. Aerospace Years Ended December 31, in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net sales 1,977 1,911 1,741 Comparable operating earnings 170 169 153 Comparable operating earnings as a of segment net sales 9 9 9 Segment sales in 2022 were 66 million higher compared to 2021, and comparable operating earnings were 1 million higher, primarily due to the company s new program wins, backlog growth and related backlog liquidation through contract performance, offset by supply chain inefficiencies and cost increases/inflationary pressures during 2022. Sales to the U.S. government, either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor, represented 98 percent of segment sales in 2022 and 97 percent in 2021. The aerospace contract mix in 2022 consisted of 40 percent cost-type contracts, which are billed at our costs plus an agreed-upon and/or earned profit component, and 57 percent fixed-price contracts. The remaining sales were for time and materials contracts.

 Backlog for the aerospace segment at December 31, 2022 and 2021, was 2.97 billion and 2.47 billion, respectively. The actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value. The segment has numerous outstanding bids for future contract awards. The backlog at December 31, 2022, consisted of 35 percent cost-type contracts. Comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations due to the nature of varying delivery and milestone schedules on contracts, funding of programs and the uncertainty of timing of future contract awards. Management Performance Measures Management internally uses various measures to evaluate company performance such as comparable operating earnings (earnings before interest, taxes and business consolidation and other non-comparable costs); comparable net earnings (earnings before business consolidation costs and other non-comparable costs after tax); comparable diluted earnings per share (comparable net earnings divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding); return on average invested capital (net operating earnings after tax over the relevant performance period divided by average invested capital over the same period); economic value added (EVA dollars (net operating earnings after tax less a capital charge on average invested capital employed); earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA); and diluted earnings per share. In addition, management uses operating cash flows as a measure to evaluate the company s liquidity. We believe this information is also useful to investors as it provides insight into the earnings and cash flow criteria that management uses to make strategic decisions. These financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods, including business consolidation costs and other non-comparable items. Nonfinancial measures used in the packaging businesses include production efficiency and spoilage rates; quality control figures; environmental, health and safety statistics; production and sales volume data; asset utilization rates and measures of sustainability. Additional measures used to evaluate financial performance in the aerospace segment include contract revenue realization, award and incentive fees realized, proposal win rates and backlog. References to sales volume data represent units shipped. Many of the above noted financial measurements are presented on a non-U.S. GAAP basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report. Non-U.S. GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A presentation of earnings in accordance with U.S. GAAP is available in Item 8 of this annual report. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES For information regarding the company s critical and significant accounting policies, as well as recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report. The company considers certain accounting estimates to be critical, as their application is made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations. Detailed below is a discussion of why, to the extent the estimate is material, these estimates are subject to uncertainty and the sensitivity of the reported amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying the estimate s calculation.

 Revenue Recognition in the Aerospace Segment Sales under fixed-price long-term contracts in the aerospace segment are primarily recognized using percentage-of-completion accounting under the cost-to-cost method. The company believes the accounting estimates related to revenue recognition in its aerospace segment are critical accounting estimates because they are highly reliant upon estimation throughout the segment s contracts with its customers. The recognition of revenue requires significant estimation on the part of management, including estimating techniques to project revenues and costs at completion and various assumptions and projections related to the outcome of future events, and evaluation of estimates of total contract revenue, total contract cost, and extent of progress toward completion. Aside from estimation of total contract cost and progress towards completion, total revenues in our aerospace segment are subject to uncertainty due to the total amount that will be paid by the customer giving rise to variable consideration. The primary types of variable consideration present in the company s contracts are cost reimbursements, performance award fees, incremental funding and finalization of government rates. The company s accounting policy around revenue recognition in its aerospace segment and further details of estimates used in revenue recognition in its aerospace segment can be found in Note 1 and Note 5 , respectively, to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report. Defined Benefit Pension Plans The company has defined benefit plans which require management to make assumptions relating to the long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates used to determine the present value of future obligations and expenses, salary inflation rates, mortality rates and other assumptions. The company believes the accounting estimates related to its pension plans are critical accounting estimates because several of the company s defined benefit plans have significant asset and liability balances, and because the assumptions used are highly susceptible to change from period to period based on the performance of plan assets, actuarial valuations, market conditions and contracted benefit changes. These assumptions do not change during the company s fiscal year unless a remeasurement event occurs in one of the plans, such as a significant settlement. The assumptions used in accounting for the company s defined benefit plans and how they have changed over time, as well as the sensitivity of the plans to changes in their related assumptions, can be found in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows and Capital Expenditures Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and external borrowings. We believe that cash flows from operating activities and cash provided by short-term, long-term and committed revolver borrowings, when necessary, will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, dividend payments, anticipated share repurchases and anticipated capital expenditures. The following table summarizes our cash flows: Years Ended December 31, in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities 301 1,760 1,432 Cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities (786) (1,639) (1,181) Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities 485 (894) (602) Cash flows provided by operating activities were 301 million in 2022, primarily driven by net earnings of 732 million, depreciation and amortization of 672 million and business consolidation and other costs of 71 million, partially offset by working capital outflows of 924 million and pension contributions of 124 million. In comparison to the same period in 2021, and after adjusting for the impact of capital expenditures, our working capital movements reflect an increase in days sales outstanding of 7 days in 2022, an increase in inventory days on hand of 14 days in 2022 and a decrease in days payable outstanding of 6 days in 2022. Cash outflows from investing activities were 786 million in 2022 predominantly driven by 1.65 billion in capital expenditures, partially offset by 455 million net cash received for the sale of our Russian aluminum beverage packaging business, net of the cash on the disposed business, and 298 million received for the for the sale of our remaining 49 percent owned equity investment in Ball Metalpack.

 Cash inflows from financing activities were 485 million in 2022, primarily driven by the issuance of 750 million of 6.875 senior notes due 2028, 394 million of borrowings under short-term uncommitted credit facilities and 200 million of borrowings under the company s long-term revolving facility, partially offset by the repayment of 738 million of 4.375 senior notes, net share repurchases of 582 million and common stock dividends of 254 million. We have entered into several regional committed and uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs with various financial institutions for certain of our accounts receivable. Programs accounted for as true sales of the receivables, without recourse to Ball, had combined limits of approximately 2.04 billion and 1.74 billion at December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. A total of 488 million and 308 million were available for sale under these programs at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 546 million of our cash was held outside of the U.S. In the event we need to utilize any of the cash held outside of the U.S. for purposes within the U.S., there are no material legal or other economic restrictions regarding the repatriation of cash from any of the countries outside the U.S. where we have cash. The company believes its U.S. operating cash flows and cash on hand, as well as availability under its long-term, revolving credit facilities, uncommitted short-term credit facilities and committed and uncommitted accounts receivable factoring programs, will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of the U.S. portion of our ongoing operations, scheduled principal and interest payments on U.S. debt, dividend payments, capital expenditures and other U.S. cash requirements. If non-U.S. funds are needed for our U.S. cash requirements and we are unable to provide the funds through intercompany financing arrangements, we may be required to repatriate funds from non-U.S. locations where the company has previously asserted indefinite reinvestment of funds outside the U.S. Based on its indefinite reinvestment assertion, the company has not provided deferred taxes on earnings in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in its international operations. It is not practical to estimate the additional taxes that might become payable if these earnings were remitted to the U.S. Share Repurchases The company s share repurchases totaled 618 million in 2022 and 766 million in 2021. The repurchases were completed using cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from the sale of businesses and available borrowings. In the second quarter of 2022, in a privately negotiated transaction, Ball entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to buy 300 million of its common shares using cash on hand and available borrowings. In the third quarter of 2022, Ball settled the agreement and received a total of 4.34 million shares with the average price paid per share of 69.06. Debt Facilities and Refinancing Given our cash flow projections and unused credit facilities that are available until June 2027, our liquidity is strong and is expected to meet our ongoing cash and debt service requirements. Total interest-bearing debt of 9.00 billion and 7.78 billion was outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During 2022, Ball issued 750 million of 6.875 senior notes due in 2028, redeemed 738 million of outstanding euro denominated 4.375 debt and completed the closing of its new revolving and term loan senior secured credit facilities that refinanced its existing senior secured credit facilities entered into in 2019. The company s senior credit facilities include a 1.35 billion term loan and long-term, multi-currency revolving facilities that mature in June 2027, which provide the company with up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of 1.75 billion. During 2021, Ball issued 850 million of 3.125 senior notes due in 2031 and redeemed the outstanding 5 senior notes due in March 2022 in the amount of 748 million. At December 31, 2022, approximately 1.49 billion was available under the company s long-term, multi-currency committed revolving credit facilities, which are available until June 2027. In addition to these facilities, the company had approximately 990 million of short-term uncommitted credit facilities available at December 31, 2022, of which 112 million was outstanding and due on demand.

 While ongoing financial and economic conditions in certain areas may raise concerns about credit risk with counterparties to derivative transactions, the company mitigates its exposure by allocating the risk among various counterparties and limiting exposure to any one party. We also monitor the credit ratings of our suppliers, customers, lenders and counterparties on a regular basis. Some of Ball s loan agreements use the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) in determining interest rates. The company is continually evaluating the impact that the transition from its LIBOR-based interest rate loan agreements to Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) based interest rate agreements will have on its consolidated financial statements. Based on our most current understanding, the LIBOR to SOFR transition is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We were in compliance with all loan agreements at December 31, 2022, and for all prior years presented, and we have met all debt payment obligations. The U.S. note agreements and bank credit agreement contain certain restrictions relating to dividends, investments, financial ratios, guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness. The most restrictive of our debt covenants requires us to maintain a leverage ratio (as defined) of no greater than 5.0 times, which will change to 4.5 times as of September 30, 2025. As of December 31, 2022, the company could borrow an additional 2.32 billion under its long-term multi-currency committed revolving facilities and short-term uncommitted credit facilities without violating our existing debt covenants. Additional details about our debt are available in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report. Defined Benefit Pension Plans The company closed its pension plans to all non-unionized new entrants in the United States effective for anyone hired after December 31, 2021. New employees instead receive a non-elective 401(k) company contribution that is expected to approximate the legacy pension benefit. Anyone employed by Ball prior to that date is unaffected by this change. Other Liquidity Measures Given the on-going growth projects in our businesses being undertaken to support EVA-enchancing contacted volumes, in 2023, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of 1.2 billion and we intend to return approximately 250 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. We further intend to utilize our operating cash flows to pay down debt and, to the extent available, repurchase Ball common stock or fund acquisitions that meet our rate of return criteria. We have committed contracts to purchase raw materials and we align these purchase commitments with long-term sales contracts with our customers such that any commitment to purchase aluminum and other direct materials corresponds to a contractual sale. These aluminum purchase commitments include pass-through provisions which generally result in proportional changes in both sales and costs of sales ; however, there may be timing differences of when the costs are passed through . The company s growth and asset maintenance plans require capital expenditures over the next years, which will be funded by operating cash flows and external borrowings. Approximately 810 million of capital expenditures were contractually committed as of December 31, 2022. Maturities for Ball s long-term debt are disclosed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report. Repayments of debt and other operational cash requirements will also be funded by operating cash flows and external borrowings. The company has no material off-balance sheet arrangements. CONTINGENCIES, INDEMNIFICATIONS AND GUARANTEES Details of the company s contingencies, legal proceedings, indemnifications and guarantees are available in Note 22 and Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements within Item 8 of this annual report. The company is routinely subject to litigation incidental to operating its businesses and has been designated by various federal and state environmental agencies as a potentially responsible party, along with numerous other companies, for the clean-up of several hazardous waste sites, including in respect of sites related to alleged activities of certain former Rexam subsidiaries. The company believes the matters identified will not have a material adverse effect upon its liquidity, results of operations or financial condition.

 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This report contains forward-looking statements concerning future events and financial performance. Words such as expects, anticipates, estimates, believes, and similar expressions typically identify forward-looking statements, which are generally any statements other than statements of historical fact. Such statements are based on current expectations or views of the future and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied. You should therefore not place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements and they should be read in conjunction with, and qualified in their entirety by, the cautionary statements referenced below. Ball undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Key factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to be different are summarized in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Exhibit 99 in Ball s Form 10-K, which are available on Ball s website and at www.sec.gov. Additional factors that might affect: a) Ball s packaging segments include product capacity, supply, and demand constraints and fluctuations and changes in consumption patterns; availability/cost of raw materials, equipment, and logistics; competitive packaging, pricing and substitution; changes in climate and weather and related events such as drought, wildfires, storms, hurricanes, tornadoes and floods; footprint adjustments and other manufacturing changes, including the startup of new facilities and lines; failure to achieve synergies, productivity improvements or cost reductions; unfavorable mandatory deposit or packaging laws; customer and supplier consolidation; power and supply chain interruptions; changes in major customer or supplier contracts or loss of a major customer or supplier; inability to pass through increased costs; war, political instability and sanctions, including relating to the situation in Russia and Ukraine and its impact on Ball s supply chain and its ability to operate in Europe, the Middle East and Africa regions generally; changes in foreign exchange or tax rates; and tariffs, trade actions, or other governmental actions, including business restrictions and orders affecting goods produced by Ball or in its supply chain, including imported raw materials; b) Ball s aerospace segment include funding, authorization, availability and returns of government and commercial contracts; and delays, extensions and technical uncertainties affecting segment contracts; c) Ball as a whole include those listed above plus: the extent to which sustainability-related opportunities arise and can be capitalized upon; changes in senior management, succession, and the ability to attract and retain skilled labor; regulatory actions or issues including those related to tax, environmental, social and governance reporting, competition, environmental, health and workplace safety, including U.S. Federal Drug Administration and other actions or public concerns affecting products filled in Ball s containers, or chemicals or substances used in raw materials or in the manufacturing process; technological developments and innovations; the ability to manage cyber threats; litigation; strikes; disease; pandemic; labor cost changes; inflation; rates of return on assets of Ball s defined benefit retirement plans; pension changes; uncertainties surrounding geopolitical events and governmental policies, including policies, orders, and actions related to COVID-19; reduced cash flow; interest rates affecting Ball s debt; and successful or unsuccessful joint ventures, acquisitions and divestitures, and their effects on Ball s operating results and business generally. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Financial Instruments and Risk Management The company employs established risk management policies and procedures which seek to reduce the company s commercial risk exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates and prices of the company s common stock with regard to common share repurchases and the company s deferred compensation stock plan. However, there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful. Although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit, market and interest risk, the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements. The company monitors counterparty credit risk, including lenders, on a regular basis, but Ball cannot be certain that all risks will be discerned or that its risk management policies and procedures will always be effective. Additionally, in the event of default under the company s master derivative agreements, the non-defaulting party has the option to set off any amounts owed with regard to open derivative positions. We have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis. Market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments, financial instruments and commodity positions. To test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure, we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in market prices or rates. The results of the sensitivity analyses are summarized below.

 Commodity Price Risk Aluminum We manage commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum through two different methods. First, we enter into container sales contracts that include aluminum-based pricing terms that generally reflect the same price fluctuations included in commercial purchase contracts for aluminum sheet. The terms include fixed, floating or pass-through aluminum component pricing. Second, we use derivative instruments as economic and cash flow hedges of commodity price risk where there are material differences between sales and purchase contracted pricing and volume. Considering the effects of derivative instruments, the company s ability to pass through certain raw material costs through contractual provisions, the market s ability to accept price increases and the company s commodity price exposures under its contract terms, a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the company s aluminum prices would result in an estimated 3 million after-tax reduction in net earnings over a one-year period. Additionally, the company has currency exposures on raw materials and the effect of a 10 percent adverse change is included in the total currency exposure discussed below. Actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates. Interest Rate Risk Our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to minimize our overall borrowing and receivables factoring costs. To achieve these objectives, we may use a variety of derivative instruments to manage our mix of floating and fixed-rate debt. Interest rate instruments held by the company at December 31, 2022, included pay-fixed interest rate swaps and options which effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed-rate instruments. Based on our interest rate exposure at December 31, 2022, assumed floating rate debt levels throughout the next 12 months and the effects of our existing derivative instruments, a 100-basis point increase in interest rates would result in an estimated 10 million after-tax reduction in net earnings over a one-year period. Actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes. Currency Exchange Rate Risk Our objective in managing exposure to currency fluctuations is to limit the exposure of cash flows and earnings from changes associated with currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts. In addition, at times Ball manages earnings translation volatility through the use of currency derivative strategies, and the change in the fair value of those derivatives is recorded in the company s net earnings. Our currency translation risk results from the currencies in which we transact business. The company faces currency exposures in our global operations as a result of various factors including intercompany currency denominated loans, selling our products in various currencies, purchasing raw materials and equipment in various currencies and tax exposures not denominated in the functional currency. Sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and, where there is not an exchange pass-through arrangement, the company may use derivative instruments to manage significant currency exposures. Considering the company s derivative financial instruments outstanding at December 31, 2022, and the various currency exposures, a hypothetical 10 percent reduction (U.S. dollar strengthening) in currency exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar would result in an estimated 15 million after-tax reduction in net earnings over a one-year period. A hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the U.S. dollar s currency exchange rates would increase our forecasted average debt balance by approximately 170 million. Actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes.

 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Ball Corporation Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ball Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of comprehensive earnings (loss), of shareholders equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
 39 

Table of Contents 
 recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Revenue Recognition - Estimated Costs at Completion for Aerospace Fixed-Price Contracts As described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, net sales for the aerospace segment were 2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, including sales under fixed-price long-term contracts, which are primarily recognized using percentage-of-completion accounting under the cost-to-cost method. The percentage-of-completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project revenues and costs at completion and various assumptions and projections related to the outcome of future events, including the quantity and timing of product deliveries, future labor performance and rates, and material and overhead costs. Throughout the period of contract performance, management regularly evaluates and, if necessary, revises its estimates of total contract revenue, total contract cost, and extent of progress toward completion. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - estimated costs at completion for aerospace fixed-price contracts is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when determining the estimated costs at completion for such contracts. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating the related audit evidence over management s assumptions of estimated costs at completion for aerospace fixed-price contracts related to the availability and cost volatility of materials, subcontractor and vendor performance, and schedule and performance delays. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the accuracy of estimated costs at completion for aerospace fixed-price contracts. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating and testing management s process for determining the estimated costs at completion for a sample of aerospace fixed-price contracts, including assessing the reasonableness of the significant assumptions related to each contract. Evaluating the reasonableness of management s assumptions related to the availability and cost volatility of materials, subcontractor and vendor performance, and schedule and performance delays involved assessing the nature and status of the aerospace fixed-price contracts, performing retrospective reviews of the aerospace fixed-price contract estimates and changes in estimates over time, obtaining evidence to support estimated costs at completion, and assessing the reasonableness of factors considered and significant assumptions made by management in determining the estimated costs at completion used to recognize revenue. /s/ February 21, 2023 We have served as the Company s auditor since at least 1962. We have not been able to determine the specific year we began serving as auditor of the Company.

 primary types of long-term sales contracts utilized are cost-type contracts, which are agreements to perform for cost plus an agreed-upon profit component, and fixed price sales contracts, which are completed for a fixed price. Cost-type sales contracts can have different types of fee arrangements, including fixed-fee, cost, milestone and performance incentive fees, award fees or a combination thereof. At the inception of contract performance, the company estimates sales associated with base, incentive and other fees exclusive of any constraint. In other words, the company estimates sales to the extent that it is not probable a significant reversal will occur over the period of contract performance. The company has determined that the above provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of goods to the customer and is the best measure of depicting the company s performance as control is transferred to customers. Due to the unique and customized nature of deliverables within aerospace contracts, a readily observable selling price for a similar good is not typically available; therefore, in making its determination of stand-alone selling price, the company generally applies the expected cost plus a margin approach (whereby the transaction price is allocated based on the relative amount of costs plus an appropriate margin). Use of the expected cost plus a margin approach requires Ball to determine the expected costs for each performance obligation, as well as an appropriate margin (i.e., cost-to-cost percentage of completion). The calculation is made at contract inception to determine the allocation of consideration. Uncertainty as to the total amount that will be paid by the customer (such as the exact amount of costs that will be incurred and fees that will be earned by us to satisfy the contractual requirements) gives rise to variable consideration. To estimate variable consideration, the company applies the most likely amount method or the expected value method depending on the nature of the variable consideration. In certain cases, both methods may be used within a single contract if multiple forms of variable consideration exist. However, once a method has been applied to one form of variable consideration, it is applied consistently throughout the contract term. The primary types of variable consideration present in the company s contracts are cost reimbursements, performance award fees, incremental funding and finalization of government rates. These types of arrangements are most commonly (though not exclusively) estimated based on the most likely method. Once variable consideration has been estimated, it will be constrained if a significant reversal of the cumulative amount of sales is probable in the context of the contract.

Finite-lived intangible assets, excluding capitalized software costs, are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of to . Capitalized software is generally amortized over estimated useful lives of to . The company periodically reviews these estimated useful lives and when appropriate, changes are made prospectively. During 2022, the company completed an evaluation of the estimated useful lives of its manufacturing equipment, buildings and certain assembly and test equipment. See Note 10 for additional discussion. For certain business consolidation activities, accelerated depreciation may be required for the revised remaining useful life for assets designated to be scrapped or abandoned. The accelerated depreciation related to such activities is recorded as part of business consolidation and other activities in the appropriate period.

 . For all contracts, the transaction price is determined upon establishment of the contract that contains the final terms of the sale, including the description, quantity, and price of each product or service purchased. Ball typically enters into master agreements with customers, which establish the terms and conditions for subsequent orders of goods. In the context of the revenue recognition standard, enforceable contracts are those that have an enforceable right to payment, which Ball typically has once a binding forecast or purchase order (or similar evidence) is in place and Ball produces under the contract. Within Ball s packaging segments, these enforceable contracts all have a duration of less than one year. Contracts that have an original duration of less than are excluded from the requirement to disclose remaining performance obligations, based on the company s election to use the practical expedient. The nature of the remaining performance obligations within these contracts, as well as the nature of the variability and how it will be resolved, are described in the section below.

 performance obligations as of the end of each reporting period or when the company expects to recognize sales. The company has also elected the sales tax practical expedient; therefore, sales and other taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from the transaction price. For shipping and handling activities performed after a customer obtains control of the goods, the company has elected to account for these costs as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the goods; therefore, these activities are not assessed as separate performance obligations. The company has also elected the significant component practical expedient which allows management to not assess whether the contract has a significant financing component in circumstances where, at contract inception, the expected contract duration is less than one year. Disaggregation of Sales The company disaggregates net sales by reportable segments, as disclosed in Note 3 , and based on the timing of transfer of control for goods and services, as disclosed in Note 5 . The transfer of control for goods and services may occur at a point in time or over time; in other words, sales may be recognized over the course of the underlying contract, or they may occur at a single point in time based upon the transfer of control. The company determined that disaggregating sales into these categories achieves the disclosure objective to depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of sales and cash flows are affected by economic factors. As disclosed in Note 3 , the company s business consists of reportable segments, which encompass disaggregated product lines and geographical areas: (1) beverage packaging, North and Central America; (2) beverage packaging, EMEA; (3) beverage packaging, South America; and (4) aerospace. Revenue Contract Balances The company enters into contracts to sell beverage packaging, aerosol packaging, and aerospace products. The payment terms and conditions in customer contracts vary. Those customers that prepay are represented by the contract liabilities shown in Note 5 , until the company s performance obligations are satisfied. Contract assets would exist when sales have been recorded (i.e., control of the goods or services has been transferred to the customer) but customer payment is contingent on a future event beyond the passage of time (i.e., satisfaction of additional performance obligations). Unbilled receivables, which are not classified as contract assets, represent arrangements in which sales have been recorded prior to billing and right to payment is unconditional.

 Contingencies The company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including those that arise in the ordinary course of business. The company records loss contingencies when it determines the outcome of the future event is probable of occurring and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies are recognized in the financial statements when they are realized or realizable. The determination of a reserve for a loss contingency is based on management s judgment of probability and estimates with respect to the likelihood of an outcome and valuation of the future event. Liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments or estimates to change. In assessing whether a loss is probable, Ball may consider the following factors, among others: the nature of the litigation, claim or assessment; available information, opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors; and the experience gained from similar cases by the company and others. The company provides disclosures for material contingencies when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may be incurred.

Ball is continually evaluating the impact transitioning its LIBOR-based interest rate loan agreements to SOFR-based interest rate agreements will have on its consolidated financial statements. Based on the company s most current understanding, the LIBOR to SOFR transition is not expected to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The company s senior notes and senior credit facilities are guaranteed on a full, unconditional and joint and several basis by certain of its material subsidiaries. Each of the guarantor subsidiaries is percent owned by Ball Corporation. These guarantees are required in support of these notes and credit facilities, are coterminous with the terms of the respective note indentures and would require performance upon certain events of default referenced in the respective guarantees. Note 23 provides further details about the company s debt guarantees of the company s senior notes and the subsidiaries that guarantee the notes (the obligor group). The U.S. note agreements and bank credit agreement contain certain restrictions relating to dividend payments, share repurchases, investments, financial ratios, guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness.

The company has not provided deferred taxes on any other outside basis differences in its investments in other non-U.S. subsidiaries as these other outside basis differences are indefinitely reinvested. A determination of the unrecognized deferred taxes related to any of these other outside basis differences is not practicable. Ball s Serbian and Polish subsidiaries benefit from tax holidays which reduced income taxes during the year by million. These tax holidays have expiration dates ranging from 2026 to 2036.

These attributes are spread across the regions in which the company operates, including Europe, North and Central America, Asia and South America, and generally have expiration periods beginning in 2023 to indefinite. Each has been assessed for realization as of December 31, 2022. In 2022, the company s overall valuation allowances decreased by a net million. The decrease was primarily due to currency exchange fluctuations and the reduction of the valuation allowance related to the Indian beverage packaging business. These decreases were partially offset by increases due to nondeductible U.K. interest expense and certain U.S. tax credits, none of which are expected to be utilized in future periods. Ball s 2022 effective tax rate was impacted by million of the net change in the valuation allowance. In 2021, the company s overall valuation allowances increased by a net million. The increase to the valuation allowance was primarily due to enacted tax rate changes in the U.K. The valuation allowance was further increased due to nondeductible U.K. interest expense and operating losses incurred primarily in various U.S. state and non-U.S. jurisdictions, none of which are expected to be utilized in future periods. These increases were partially offset by reductions due to the utilization of previously unrealized operating losses. Ball s 2021 effective tax rate was impacted by million of the change in the valuation allowance. In 2020, the company s overall valuation allowances increased by a net million. The increase to the valuation allowance was primarily due to nondeductible U.K. interest expense and operating losses incurred primarily in various U.S. state and non-U.S. jurisdictions, none of which are expected to be utilized in future periods.

 million, inclusive of interest, penalties and the indirect benefits of related items. The company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal, various state, local and non-U.S. jurisdictions. The U.S. federal statute of limitations is closed for years prior to 2014. With a few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to examination by state and local tax authorities for years prior to 2014. The company s significant non-U.S. filings are in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Egypt, France, Germany, Mexico, Paraguay, Poland, Serbia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the U.K. The company s non-U.S. statutes of limitations are generally open for years after 2018. At December 31, 2022, the company is either under examination or has been notified of a pending examination by tax authorities in Austria, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Egypt, France, Germany, India, the Netherlands, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, the U.S. and various U.S. states. Due primarily to potential expiration of certain statutes of limitations and settlements, it is reasonably possible that a decrease in the range of million to million in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the coming year, some of which would reduce income tax expense. The company recognizes the accrual of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Ball recognized million of tax benefit, million of tax benefit and million of tax benefit in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for potential interest on these items. At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the accrual for uncertain tax positions included potential interest expense of million, million and million, respectively. The company has accrued penalties of million in 2021 and million in 2020. Less: Current portion ) ) Long-term defined benefit pension liabilities Long-term retiree medical liabilities Deferred compensation plans Other The company s defined benefit plans for salaried employees, as well as those for hourly employees in Sweden, Switzerland, the U.K. and Ireland, provide pension benefits based on employee compensation and years of service. Plans for North American hourly employees provide benefits based on fixed rates for each year of service. While the German, Swedish and certain U.S. plans are not funded, the company maintains liabilities, and annual additions to such liabilities are generally tax-deductible. With the exception of the unfunded German, Swedish and certain U.S. plans, the company s policy is to fund the defined benefit plans in amounts at least sufficient to satisfy statutory funding requirements, taking into consideration deductibility under existing tax laws and regulations. The company closed its pension plans to all non-unionized new entrants in the United States effective for anyone hired after December 31, 2021. Anyone employed by Ball prior to that date is unaffected by this change.

 Components of net periodic benefit cost were as follows: Interest cost Expected return on plan assets ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) Amortization of prior service cost Recognized net actuarial loss Settlement losses and other one-time charges (a) Net periodic benefit cost for Ball sponsored plans ) ) 

 (a) Settlement losses and other one-time charges resulted from regular lump sum payments, purchases of non-participating group annuity contracts, headcount reduction actions and terminated vested buy-out activities. These settlement losses were recorded in business consolidation and other activities. The company s impacted U.S. pension obligations were remeasured in connection with the settlements. Non-service pension income of million in 2022, million in 2021 and million in 2020, is included in selling, general, and administrative (SG A) expenses. Contributions to the company s defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately million in 2023. This estimate may change based on changes in the Pension Protection Act, actual plan asset performance and available company cash flow, among other factors. Benefit payments related to the plans are expected to be approximately million, million, million, million and million for the years ending December 31, 2023 through 2027, respectively, and approximately billion in total for the years ending December 31, 2028 through 2032. Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the company s significant U.S. plans at December 31 were as follows: Rate of compensation increase Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the company s significant European plans at December 31 were as follows: Rate of compensation increase Pension increase

Table of Contents Ball Corporation Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the company s significant U.S. plans for the years ended December 31 were as follows: Rate of compensation increase Expected long-term rate of return on assets Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the company s significant European plans for the years ended December 31 were as follows: Rate of compensation increase Pension increase Expected long-term rate of return on assets N/A N/A N/A The discount and compensation increase rates used above to determine the December 31, 2022, benefit obligations will be used to determine net periodic benefit cost for 2023. A reduction of the expected return on pension assets assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in an approximate million increase in 2023 pension expense, while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate applied to the pension liability would result in an approximate million increase to pension expense in 2023. Accounting for pensions and postretirement benefit plans requires that the benefit obligation be discounted to reflect the time value of money at the measurement date and the rates of return currently available on high-quality, fixed-income securities whose cash flows (via coupons and maturities) match the timing and amount of future benefit plan payments. Other factors used in measuring the obligation include compensation increases, health care cost increases, future rates of inflation, mortality and employee turnover. Actual results may differ from the company s actuarial assumptions, which may have an impact on the amount of reported expense or liability for pensions or postretirement benefits. In 2022, the company recorded pension expense of million for Ball-sponsored plans, including million of settlement charges , and the company currently expects its 2023 pension expense to be million, using currency exchange rates in effect at December 31, 2022. The expected decrease in pension expense is primarily the result of closing the U.S. pension plan to new entrants hired after December 31, 2021, a reduction in U.S. employees, an increase in discount rates and higher estimated return on pension plan assets for 2023. The assumption related to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for pension benefits over the life of the plans. The assumption was based upon Ball s pension plan asset allocations, investment strategies and the views of its investment managers, consultants and other large pension plan sponsors. Some reliance was placed on the historical and expected asset returns of the company s plans. An asset-allocation optimization model was used to project future asset returns using simulation and asset class correlation. The analysis included expected future risk premiums, forward-looking return expectations derived from the yield on long-term bonds and the price earnings ratios of major stock market indexes, expected inflation levels and real risk-free interest rate assumptions and the fund s expected asset allocation. The expected long-term rates of return on assets were calculated by applying the expected rate of return to a market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year, adjusted for the weighted average expected contributions and benefit payments. The market-related value of plan assets used to calculate the expected return was million for 2022, million for 2021 and million for 2020.

 different methods. First, the company enters into container sales contracts that include aluminum-based pricing terms which generally reflect the same price fluctuations under commercial purchase contracts for aluminum sheet. The terms include fixed, floating or pass through aluminum component pricing. Second, the company uses certain derivative instruments, including option and forward contracts, as economic and cash flow hedges of commodity price risk where there are material differences between sales and purchase contracted pricing and volume. Interest Rate Risk - The company s objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, the company may use a variety of interest rate swaps, collars and options to manage its mix of floating and fixed-rate debt. Currency Exchange Rate Risk - The company s objective in managing exposure to currency fluctuations is to limit the exposure of cash flows and earnings from changes associated with currency exchange rate changes through the use of various derivative contracts. In addition, at times the company manages earnings translation volatility through the use of currency option strategies, and the change in the fair value of those options is recorded in the company s net earnings. The following table provides additional information related to the commercial risk management derivative instruments described above: (a) Net gain (loss) included in AOCI, after-tax ) (b) Net gain (loss) included in AOCI, after-tax, expected to be recognized in net earnings within the next 12 months ) (b) Longest duration of forecasted cash flow hedge transactions in years

 Common Stock Price Risk The company s deferred compensation stock program is subject to variable plan accounting and, accordingly, is marked to fair value using the company s closing stock price at the end of the related reporting period. The company entered into total return swaps to reduce the company s earnings exposure to these fair value fluctuations that will be outstanding through May 2023, and which have a combined notional value of million shares. Based on the current number of shares in the program, each change in the company s stock price would have an insignificant impact on pretax earnings, net of the impact of related derivatives. Collateral Calls The company s agreements with its financial counterparties require the company to post collateral in certain circumstances when the negative mark to fair value of the contracts exceeds specified levels. Additionally, the company has collateral posting arrangements with certain customers on these derivative contracts. The cash flows of the margin calls are shown within the investing section of the company s consolidated statements of cash flows. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features was insignificant and collateral was required to be posted.

 million in the aggregate, and such amounts have been included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities at December 31, 2022. In February 2012, Ball Metal Beverage Container Corp. (BMBCC) filed an action against Crown Packaging Technology, Inc. (Crown) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (the Court) seeking a declaratory judgment that the manufacture, sale and use of certain ends by BMBCC and its customers do not infringe certain claims of Crown s U.S. patents. Crown subsequently filed a counterclaim alleging infringement of certain claims in these patents seeking unspecified monetary damages, fees and declaratory and injunctive relief. The District Court issued a claim construction order at the end of December 2015 and held a scheduling conference on February 10, 2016, to determine the timeline for future steps in the litigation. The case was stayed by mutual agreement of the parties into the third quarter of 2016, during which Crown made preparations for its discovery with respect to certain ends previously produced by Rexam s U.S. subsidiary, Rexam Beverage Can Company (RBCC). Such discovery began during the first half of 2017 and concluded in the fourth quarter of 2018. The parties attempted to mediate the case on August 1, 2017, but no progress was made, and the case continued as scheduled. In December 2018, BMBCC and RBCC filed a motion for summary judgment that the Crown patents at issue are invalid and that the applicable ends supplied by BMBCC and RBCC did not infringe the patents. Crown did not file a motion for summary judgment. On June 21, 2019, the District Court issued an order sustaining the BMBCC/RBCC motion as to invalidity, declining to rule on the other grounds as moot, and indicating that an expanded opinion and an appealable order would be forthcoming. The expanded opinion was docketed on July 22, 2019. The final, appealable order was issued by the Court on September 25, 2019, and the expanded opinion was unsealed. On October 22, 2019, Crown filed a Notice of Appeal of the decision of the Court to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On December 31, 2020, the Court of Appeals vacated the decision of the District Court and remanded the case for further proceedings. The District Court held a telephonic hearing with counsel for the parties in March 2021 to discuss the scope of the proceedings on remand and initial position statements regarding remand which was submitted by each party. The District Court also directed each party to submit a document in response to the initial position statements of the other party in April 2021. The parties submitted their position statements to the District Court on April 21, 2021. On August 25, 2021, the Court issued its order regarding the further proceedings permitting each party to submit supplemental expert reports and depositions of the experts. On September 9, 2021, the parties submitted a Submission Regarding Scheduling in which most issues were agreed, but the Court was requested to resolve a disagreement regarding the process and timing for the submission of each expert s report and the deposition of the experts. The Court issued its Order resolving the disagreement on August 12, 2022, and issued a further Scheduling Order on August 30, 2022, that outlines the litigation process and schedule for the proceedings on remand over the following twelve months. Based on the information available at the present time, the company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect upon its liquidity, results of operations or financial condition.

 million associated with this contingency; see Note 6 for further details. After recording this charge, Ball has financial exposure on balances associated with the customer of million, which are presented in receivables, net, other current assets, and other assets, in its consolidated balance sheet. Ball considers that losses in the event of an unfavorable outcome to the dispute and any related legal action (or gains in the event of a favorable outcome) would not have a material effect upon its liquidity, results of operations or financial condition. During the fourth quarter of 2022, Ball recorded charges of million due to a regional beverage packaging customer in North America as a result of allegations that the company did not fulfill supply in prior years under a contract assumed by Ball in the 2016 Rexam acquisition, at which time Ball was required as part of regulatory approvals to enter into a contract manufacturing agreement (CMA) with the purchaser of the assets divested concurrently with the Rexam acquisition. Although not currently realizable, Ball is actively pursuing opportunities to reduce the charges recognized in 2022 based on the indemnity in the CMA, and will commence legal proceedings, if needed, based on the indemnity.

Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors may be made at any annual meeting of shareholders (a) by or at the direction of the board of directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or (b) by any shareholder of the corporation (i) who is a shareholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section D and on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote at such annual meeting and (ii) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section D. 
 In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination to be made by a shareholder, such shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the corporation. To be timely, a shareholder s notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders; provided , however , that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs. In no event shall the public disclosure of an adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholder s notice as described above. To be in proper written form, a shareholder s notice to the Secretary must set forth as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election as a director and as to the shareholder giving the notice and any Shareholder Associated Person (as defined below) (i) the name, age, business address, residence address and record address of such person, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of such person, (iii) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such person, (iv) any information relating to such person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, (v) the nominee holder for, and number of, shares owned beneficially but not of record by such person, (vi) whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of, or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options or borrowed or loaned shares) has been made, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to or manage risk or benefit of share price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of, such person with respect to any share of stock of the corporation, (vii) to the extent known by the shareholder giving the notice, the name and address of any other shareholder supporting the nominee for election or reelection as a director on the date of such shareholder s notice, (viii) a description of

Any information required by this paragraph shall be supplemented by the shareholder giving the notice not later than ten (10) days after the record date for the meeting as of the record date. Such notice must be accompanied by a written consent of each proposed nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a director for a full term if elected. The corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the corporation or that could be material to a reasonable shareholder s understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee. Additionally, without limiting the other provisions and requirements of this Section D, unless otherwise required by law, if any shareholder (i) provides notice pursuant to Rule 14a-19(b) under the Exchange Act, and (ii) subsequently fails to comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-19(a)(2) and Rule 14a-19(a)(3) under the Exchange Act, then the corporation shall disregard any proxies or votes solicited for such shareholder s nominees. Upon request by the corporation, if any shareholder provides notice pursuant to Rule 14a-19(b) under the Exchange Act, such shareholder shall deliver to the corporation, no later than five business days prior to the applicable meeting, reasonable evidence that it has met the requirements of Rule 14a-19(a)(3) under the Exchange Act. No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section D (including the provision of the information required pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph). If the Chairman of the meeting determines that a nomination was not made in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the Chairman shall declare to the meeting that the nomination was defective and such defective nomination shall be disregarded.

 -5- 

Governance Committee (the Committee ). As used in this Section C, an uncontested election of directors of the corporation is an election in which the only nominees are persons nominated by the board of directors of the corporation. The Committee will consider such tendered resignation and, within sixty (60) days following the certification of the shareholder vote, will make a recommendation to the board of directors concerning the acceptance or rejection of such resignation. In determining its recommendation to the board, the Committee will consider all factors deemed relevant by the members of the Committee. The Committee also will consider a range of possible alternatives concerning the director s tendered resignation as the members of the Committee deem appropriate, including, without limitation, acceptance of the resignation, rejection of the resignation or rejection of the resignation coupled with a commitment to seek to address and cure the underlying reasons reasonably believed by the Committee to have substantially resulted in the withheld votes. The board of directors of the corporation will take formal action on the Committee s recommendation no later than ninety-five (95) days following the certification of the shareholder vote. In considering the Committee s recommendation, the board will consider the information, factors and alternatives considered by the Committee and such additional information, factors and alternatives as the board deems relevant. Following the board s decision on the Committee s recommendation, the corporation, within four (4) business days after such decision is made, will publicly disclose, in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the board s decision, together with an explanation of the process by which the decision was made and, if applicable, the board s reason or reasons for its decision. No director who, in accordance with this Section C, is required to tender his or her resignation, shall participate in the Committee s deliberations or recommendation, or in the board s deliberations or determination, with respect to accepting or rejecting his or her resignation as a director. If a majority of the members of the Committee received a greater number of votes withheld from their election than votes for their election, then the independent directors then serving on the board of directors who received a greater number of votes for their election than votes withheld from their election, and the directors, if any, who were not standing for election, will appoint an ad hoc board committee from among themselves (the Ad Hoc Committee ), consisting of such number of directors as they may determine to be appropriate, solely for the purpose of considering and making a recommendation to the board with respect to the tendered resignations. The Ad Hoc Committee shall serve in place of the Committee and perform the Committee s duties for purposes of this Section C. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Ad Hoc Committee would have been created but fewer than three directors would be eligible to serve on it, the entire board of directors (other than the director whose resignation is being considered) will make the determination to accept or reject the tendered resignation without any recommendation from the Committee and without the creation of an Ad Hoc Committee.

 (2) The termination of a proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent is not, of itself, determinative that the director or officer did not meet the standard of conduct set forth in the IBCL.
 (3) To the extent that a director or officer has been wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which he was a party, or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, because he is or was a director or officer of the corporation, the corporation shall indemnify the director or officer against reasonable expenses incurred by him in connection therewith regardless of whether the director or officer has met the standards set forth in the IBCL and without any action or determination under Section D of this Article Five.
 Section B. Advancement of Expenses. 

 -11- 

(1) The corporation shall pay for or reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred by a director or officer who is a party to a proceeding in advance of final disposition of the proceeding if:

 (a) By the board of directors by majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;

control of the corporation concerning the rights of any person seeking indemnification under this Article Five, such determination shall be made by special legal counsel selected by such person and approved by the board of directors or its committee in the manner described in Section C(1)(c) above (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), which counsel has not otherwise performed services (other than in connection with similar matters) within the five (5) years preceding its engagement to render such opinion for such person or for the corporation or any affiliates (as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) of the corporation (whether or not they were affiliates when services were so performed) Independent Counsel ). Unless such person has theretofore selected Independent Counsel pursuant to this Section C and such Independent Counsel has been approved by the corporation, legal counsel approved by a resolution or resolutions of the board of directors of the corporation prior to a change of control of the corporation shall be deemed to have been approved by the corporation as required. Such Independent Counsel shall determine as promptly as practicable whether and to what extent such person would be permitted to be indemnified under applicable law and shall render its written opinion to the corporation and such person to such effect. In making a determination under this Section C, the special legal counsel and Independent Counsel referred to above shall determine that indemnification is permissible unless clearly precluded by this Article Five or the applicable provisions of the IBCL.

This Article Five shall be deemed to grant each person who is entitled to indemnification hereunder rights against the corporation to enforce the provisions of this Article Five, and any repeal or other modification of this Article Five or any repeal or modification of the IBCL or any other applicable law shall not limit any rights of indemnification then existing or arising out of events, acts, omissions, circumstances occurring or existing prior to such repeal or modification, including, without limitation, the right to indemnification for proceedings commenced after such repeal or modification to enforce this Article Five with regard to acts, omissions, events or circumstances occurring or existing prior to such repeal or modification.

Exhibit 4.2(d) DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 The following summary of certain terms of our common stock describes material provisions of, but does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended, the Certificate of Incorporation ), our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the Bylaws ), the forms of which are included as exhibits to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4(d) is also included, as well as the relevant portions of the Indiana Corporations Law. DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK The following is a description of certain material terms of our amended articles of incorporation, bylaws and of certain provisions of Indiana law. The following summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our amended articles of incorporation and bylaws, and the relevant provisions of Indiana law. General Our authorized capital structure consists of: 1,100,000,000 shares of common stock, without par value: and 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without par value As of February 16, 2023, there were 314,424,560 shares of common stock and no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding. Common Stock Voting The holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on each matter submitted to a vote of shareholders, including the election of directors, and do not have any right to cumulate votes in the election of directors. Dividends Subject to the rights and preferences of the holders of any series of preferred stock which may at the time be outstanding, holders of our common stock are entitled to such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available. Liquidation Rights In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, after payment of all of our debts and liabilities and subject to the rights and preferences of the holders of any series of our preferred stock, the holders of our common stock will be entitled to receive the distribution of any of our remaining assets. Other matters Holders of our common stock have no conversion, preemptive or other subscription rights and there are no redemption rights or sinking fund provisions with respect to the common stock. Preferred Stock We are authorized to issue up to 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. Our 

 amended articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to determine and state the designations and the relative rights (including, if any, conversion rights, participation rights, voting rights, dividend rights and stated, redemption and liquidation values), preferences, limitations and restrictions of each unissued series. All shares of preferred stock of the same series must be identical with each other in all respects. Our board may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. When we issue preferred stock, we will provide specific information about the particular class or series being offered in a prospectus supplement. This information will include some or all of the following: the title or designation of the series; the number of shares to be included in the series; whether dividends, if any, will be cumulative or noncumulative and the dividend rate of the series; the conditions upon which and the dates at which dividends, if any, will be payable, and the relation that such dividends, if any, will bear to the dividends payable on any other class or classes of stock; the redemption rights and price or prices, if any, for shares of the series and at whose option such redemption may occur, and any limitations, restrictions or conditions on such redemption; the terms and amounts of any sinking fund provided for the purchase or redemption of shares of the series; the amounts payable on and the preferences, if any, of shares of the series, in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of Ball Corporation; whether the preferred stock being offered will be listed on any securities exchange; if necessary, a discussion of certain federal income tax considerations applicable to the preferred stock being offered; the voting rights, in addition to the voting rights provided by law, if any, of the holders of shares of such series; and any other relative rights, preferences, limitations and powers not inconsistent with applicable law or our articles of incorporation or bylaws then in effect. Upon issuance, the shares of preferred stock will be fully paid and nonassessable, which means that its holders will have paid their purchase price in full and we may not require them to pay additional funds. Certain Anti-Takeover Matters As previously disclosed in SEC filings, we announced our plans to eliminate our classified Board structure in January 2022, and we are continuing the process of that transition. Certain provisions of our amended articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as certain provisions of the Indiana Business Corporation Law, may have the effect of encouraging persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue non-negotiated takeover attempts. These provisions include: Removal of Directors Only for Cause; Filling Vacancies Our amended articles of incorporation provide that, subject to the right of holders of any series of preferred stock to elect directors, any director may be removed from office, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75 of the combined voting power of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. Our amended articles of incorporation also provide that, subject to the right of holders of any series of preferred stock to elect directors, any newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancy on the board shall be filled by the affirmative 

 vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, even though less than a quorum. Any director elected in accordance with the preceding sentence will hold office for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the new directorship was created or the vacancy occurred and until such director s successor shall have been elected and qualified. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the board of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. The director removal and vacancy provisions restrict the ability of a third party to remove incumbent directors and simultaneously gain control of the board of directors by filling the vacancies created by removal with its own nominees. Advance Notice Requirements Our bylaws set forth advance notice procedures with regard to shareholder nomination of candidates for election as directors and shareholder proposals of business to be presented at annual meetings of shareholders. These procedures provide that notice of such shareholder nominations or proposals must be given timely in proper written form to the Secretary of Ball Corporation prior to the meeting at which the shareholder nominee or such business is to be considered. Generally, to be timely, notice must be received at our principal executive offices not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the meeting. To be in proper written form, the notice must contain the information required by our bylaws, including information regarding the proposal and the proponent. The advance notice requirements may have the effect of discouraging a potential acquiror from conducting a proxy contest to elect directors or otherwise attempting to influence or gain control of our company. Special Meetings of Shareholders Our bylaws do not grant shareholders the right to call a special meeting of shareholders. Under our bylaws, special meetings of shareholders may be called only by our chairman of the board or by the board of directors or as otherwise may be required by law. Restrictions on Certain Related Party Business Combination Transactions In order to approve certain business combination transactions involving related parties, our amended articles of incorporation require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75 of the then outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. These related party business combination transactions include: any merger or consolidation of us or any of our subsidiaries with (1) any related party or (2) any other person or entity who or which is, or after such merger or consolidation would be, an affiliate or associate of the related party; any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition to any related party or an affiliate or associate of a related party of any assets of Ball Corporation or any of our subsidiaries having an aggregate fair market value of 10,000,000 or more; any issuance or transfer by us or any of our subsidiaries of any securities having an aggregate fair market value of 10,000,000 or more of Ball Corporation or any of our subsidiaries to any related party or an affiliate or associate of a related party in exchange for cash, securities or property (or combination thereof); the adoption of any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of us proposed by or on behalf of a related party or an affiliate or associate of a related party; any reclassification of securities or recapitalization of us, or any merger or consolidation of us with any of our subsidiaries or any other transaction that has the effect, either directly or indirectly, of increasing the proportionate share of the outstanding shares of any class of equity or convertible securities of us or any of our subsidiaries that is directly or indirectly owned by any related party or an affiliate or associate of a related party; or any agreement, contract or other arrangement providing for any one or more of the transactions mentioned above. 

 A related party is a person or entity who or which (1) is the beneficial owner of more than 10 of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; or (2) is one of our affiliates or associates and at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of 10 or more of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; or (3) is an assignee of or has otherwise succeeded to any shares of our voting stock that were at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question beneficially owned by any related party, if such assignment or succession shall have occurred in the course of a transaction not involving a public offering within the meaning of the Securities Act. The supermajority voting requirement does not apply, however, if: the related party business combination transaction is approved by a majority of directors who are unaffiliated with the related party and who were directors before such person or entity became a related party; or specified price, form of consideration and procedural requirements have been met. Indiana Business Combinations Statute We are subject to Chapter 43, the Business Combinations Chapter, of the Indiana Business Corporation Law. Our bylaws provide that Chapter 42, the Control Share Acquisition Chapter, of the Indiana Business Corporation Law shall not apply to control share acquisitions of shares of our capital stock. Subject to exceptions set forth in the Business Combinations Chapter, that Chapter prohibits an Indiana corporation from engaging in certain business combination transactions, including transactions similar to the related party business combination transactions described above, with any interested shareholder for a period of five years following the date that the shareholder first became an interested shareholder, unless the business combination or the purchase of shares made by the interested shareholder on such date is approved by the board of directors of the corporation prior to such date. If prior approval of the board of directors is not obtained, several price and procedural requirements must be met before the business combination may be completed. In general, the Business Combinations Chapter defines an interested shareholder as any person who or which (1) is the beneficial owner of 10 or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation or (2) is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and at any time within the five year period immediately before the date in question was the beneficial owner of 10 or more of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of the corporation. Transfer Agent The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Computershare Trust Company.

REVISED JULY 27, 2022 Ball Corporation Executive Officers and Board of Directors Business Ethics Statement For years employees, officers and directors have operated under the Ball Corporation Ball or Corporation Board of Directors Policies, which rely on fundamental legal and business principles for the conduct of Ball s business. In addition, all employees of Ball, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Controller, have been subject to a code of business ethics which served as a reminder of the ethical commitments of all employees. The original Code of Business Ethics applicable to employees was endorsed by the Ball Board of Directors (the Board in April 1994 and has been reviewed and revised periodically since 1994. In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC has disclosure rules and the New York Stock Exchange NYSE has Listing Standards which make it desirable for a separate business ethics statement to be in place for the Executive Officers and Directors of Ball (the Statement ), which is equivalent to the policies governing the conduct of its employees. Goals Executive Officers and Directors of Ball should conduct their business affairs on behalf of Ball using the highest level of ethics and principles towards the goal of achieving business success within the law, Ball Board policies and ethics standards. The Board or committees of its choosing should oversee and the Executive Officers of Ball should seek to ensure that adequate internal control over financial reporting and appropriate disclosure controls and procedures are in place for Ball. The reputation of Ball for honesty and fair dealing should be continued. The conduct of Executive Officers and Directors should be lawful and in accordance with any applicable Ball Board policies and ethics standards. Conflicts of Interest Each Executive Officer and Director shall conduct himself or herself with high ethical standards to avoid a conflict of interest with the Corporation or its stockholders. A conflict of interest, in the broad sense, may arise where an individual s position or responsibilities on behalf of the Corporation present an opportunity for personal gain (including with respect to such person s family members) apart from the normal rewards of employment or service as an Executive Officer or Director of Ball. It may also arise where an individual s personal interests are so inconsistent with the Corporation s interests that the latter become secondary, or otherwise conflict with his or her proper loyalties to the Corporation. Areas which require specific attention are: 

Personal Financial Interest 
 Executive Officers and Directors should avoid any outside commercial interests which might influence their official decisions or actions. Such outside commercial interests could include (a) a financial interest in an enterprise which has business relations with the Corporation if such financial interest represents a significant part of the net worth of the individual or enterprise; and (b) an investment in another business which competes with any of the Corporation s interests if such investment represents a significant part of the net worth of the individual or of the net value of the other business. In short, financial activity in any form which would involve or suggest self dealing should be avoided. Inside Information 
 Executive Officers and Directors shall refrain from the purchase or sale of the Corporation s securities or from involvement in any outside transaction which is influenced by confidential information or special knowledge of the Corporation s activities. Confidential information or special knowledge would be that which is not generally known or available to the public and is material. Gratuities 
 Each Executive Officer and Director should not place himself or herself under actual or apparent obligation to anyone by accepting or permitting those close to him/her to accept gifts or other favors where it might appear that they were given for the purpose of improperly influencing the individual in the performance of his/her duties. Outside Activities 
 Executive Officers and Directors should avoid outside employment or activities which would substantially impair the effective performance of their obligations to the Corporation, either because of excessive demands on their time, or because of their assumption of outside commitments is contrary to their commitments to the Corporation. Finally, material conflict of interest situations do occasionally present themselves and those that do are hopefully inadvertent. Where only potential, they should be avoided by personal foresight and planning. Where actual, they should be eliminated promptly upon their discovery, and full disclosure should be made to the Chairman of the Board who will deal with the matter. Corporate Opportunity Executive Officers and Directors should advance the legitimate interests of Ball. Executive Officers and Directors should not take for themselves, or their families, business opportunities that are discerned through the use of Ball property, information or position or use Ball property, information or position for their personal gain without full prior disclosure to the Chairman of the Board who will deal with the matter. Executive Officers and Directors should avoid competing with Ball without full prior disclosure to the Chairman of the Board who will deal with the matter. 

Confidential Business Information Executive Officers and Directors of Ball should maintain the confidentiality of business information imparted to them in the course of their service to Ball, except to advance the legitimate business interests of Ball or where disclosure is legally mandated. Protection and Use of the Corporation s Assets The Board or committees of its choosing oversees and the Directors and Executive Officers are responsible for the protection of Ball s assets and their efficient use. Executive Officers and Directors should use Ball assets for legitimate business purposes of Ball and not for any unlawful or improper purpose. No Personal Loans to Executive Officers and Directors The Corporation will comply with the provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 prohibiting the extension of credit in the form of personal loans to Executive Officers and Directors of Ball. Full, Fair, Accurate, Timely, and Understandable Disclosure The Board or committees of its choosing oversees , and the appropriate Executive Officers are responsible for designing or causing the design and establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures of Ball , maintenance of financial information consistent with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, SEC rules and regulations and Ball policy and procedures and the prevention and detection of fraud by employees who have a significant role in the internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures of Ball. Compliance with Laws and Regulations Ball policy is to comply with all laws and regulations applicable to its business. Executive Officers and Directors should comply with all laws and regulations in any country in which they are so acting. Laws and regulations may sometimes be ambiguous or difficult to interpret. Questions concerning interpretation or compliance should be referred to the Law Department, who may refer such question to the General Counsel for appropriate action. Fair Dealing Ball depends on its reputation for quality, service and integrity. The way we deal with competitors and companies with which we do business molds the Corporation s reputation, builds long-term trust and ultimately determines our success. Executive Officers and Directors should endeavor to deal fairly with the Corporation s competitors and their employees and with companies with which the Corporation does business and their employees. The Corporation should never take unfair advantage of others through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts or any other unfair dealing practice. 

Transactions with Related Persons The Corporation and its Executive Officers and Directors will comply with all SEC and NYSE requirements concerning transactions between the Corporation and related persons , as defined in the applicable SEC and NYSE rules. To facilitate compliance with such requirements, the following procedures will be followed for the review, approval or ratification of any transaction required to be reported under the applicable rules: (a) each Executive Officer and Director shall promptly report to the Chairman of the Board any transaction undertaken or contemplated by such officer or director, by any beneficial owner of five percent or more of the Corporation s voting securities or by any immediate family member; (b) the Chairman of the Board will refer the transaction to the General Counsel for review and recommendations; (c) after receipt of such review and recommendations, the Chairman of the Board shall bring the matter forward at the next meeting of the Nominating /Corporate Governance Committee to consider whether the transaction in question should be approved, ratified, suspended, revoked or terminated; and (d) in reviewing each transaction, the Chairman, the General Counsel and the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee shall apply all relevant laws, rules, good corporate practice and the provisions of this Statement, including in particular those pertaining to conflicts of interest. Existing Ball Policy and Ethics Executive Officers and employee Directors of Ball remain subject to the Business Ethics Code of Conduct, Ball policies and compliance requirements applicable to Ball employees. Compliance with Statement Executive Officers and Directors of Ball are expected to comply with this Statement. Amendments may only be made by the Nominating /Corporate Governance Committee of the Board or the entire Board. Such amendments will be disclosed in a manner which complies with SEC and NYSE requirements. Violations and Waivers The Chairman of the Board or his/her designate will be the focal point for coordinating and delivering the needed information to the appropriate committee of the Board or the disinterested members of the entire Board to address violations of this Statement, requests for waivers of relevant portions of this Statement or implied waivers of portions of this Statement. Executive Officers and Directors are expected to cooperate as required in the development of the needed information. The Chair of the Nominating / Corporate Governance Committee, with the assistance of the General Counsel, will be the focal point for coordinating and delivering the needed information to the appropriate committee of the Board or the disinterested members of the entire Board to address any of the above with regard to the Chairman of the Board. The entire Nominating /Corporate Governance Committee or all of the disinterested Directors of the Board shall be the only bodies authorized to grant waivers or implied waivers regarding this Business Ethics Statement. Such waivers or implied waivers will be disclosed in a manner which complies with SEC and NYSE requirements. 

Reporting Concerns Executive Officers and Directors are encouraged to talk to supervisors, managers or other appropriate Ball personnel, including the General Counsel, about observed or suspected illegal or unethical behavior. Interested parties , including employees of the Corporation, may communicate in writing concerns under this Statement including accounting, internal control over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, auditing, legal and ethical matters. Concerns related to accounting, internal control over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, auditing and legal matters should be sent to the Chair of the Audit Committee, c/o Corporate Secretary by mail to P.O. Box 5000, Broomfield, CO 80038-5000 or via facsimile transmission to (303) 460-2691. Anonymous submissions or submissions marked confidential should be sent by mail. In addition, any employee may report concerns through the Corporation s compliance Hot Line as set out in the Corporation s Business Ethics Code of Conduct. All other concerns related to this Statement should be sent to the Chairman of the Board or the Chair Nominating / Corporate Governance Committee, as appropriate, c/o Corporate Secretary at the above addresses. 
 The Chairman of the Board or the Chair of the appropriate committee may instruct the Corporate Secretary to review, sort and summarize communications submitted by mail to assist the Board and the appropriate committee in addressing the communications.

Exhibit 99 SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the Reform Act), Ball is hereby filing cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause Ball s actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Ball. Forward-looking statements may be made in several different contexts; for example, in the company s Form 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), quarterly and annual earnings news releases, quarterly earnings conference calls hosted by the company, public presentations at investor and credit conferences, the company s Annual Report and in other periodic communications with investors. As time passes, the relevance and accuracy of forward-looking statements may change; however, except as required by law, the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. You are advised to consult any further disclosures and cautionary statements Ball makes on related subjects in our Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports and other filings with the SEC. The Reform Act defines forward-looking statements as statements that express or imply an expectation or belief and contain a projection, plan or assumption with regard to, among other things, future revenues, income, earnings per share, cash flow or capital structure. Words such as expects, anticipates, estimates, believes, targets, likely, foresees , positions and similar expressions typically identify forward-looking statements, which are generally any statements other than statements of historical fact. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and you should therefore not place undue reliance upon such statements. Rather, these statements involve estimates, assumptions uncertainties and known and unknown risks, many of which are outside our control, and such statements are therefore qualified in their entirety by reference to the following important factors, among others (including those described in any Risk Factors section of our most current Form 10-K, 10-Q or other filings with the SEC), that could cause Ball s actual results or performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Ball: Fluctuation in customer and consumer growth, spending, demand or preferences, and changes in consumption patterns, both on a seasonal basis and those that may be longer-term or structural in nature, including any effect on demand for our products as a result of the enactment of laws and programs aimed at discouraging the consumption or altering the package or portion size of certain of our customers products.

Financial risks, including inflation and changes in interest rates affecting our debt or our ability to comply with the terms of our debt instruments; changes in the hedging markets or our inability or failure to economically hedge or insure against certain risks or potential exposures; changes in international currency exchange rates of the currencies in the countries in which the company and its joint ventures carry on business; counterparty risk; liquidity risk; inflation or deflation; and changes in capital availability and our access to financing, including the risk of constraints on financing in the event of a credit rating downgrade.
