Item
1. Business. 

Overview
and Background 

The
Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 21, 2013, under the name Nuts Bolts International, Inc. It was incorporated
to engage in the business of publishing eBooks under the Nuts and Bolts brand name. Its business operations were conducted through its
wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Nuts and Bolts Publishing, LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company. From inception through
February 29, 2016, the Company conducted limited operations including publishing two eBooks and one online self-help course
on how to start a freelancing business. 

On
February 29, 2016, the Company had a change of control. On that date, Tan Sri Dato Sri Lai Teck Peng, a resident of Malaysia,
acquired control of the Company through purchase of 5,000,000 shares of common stock, representing approximately 77.67 of its issued
and outstanding common stock. On the same date, the previous officers and directors of the Company resigned, and Mr. Lai was appointed
as a Director and as CEO of the Company. 

Following
the change of control the Company elected to discontinue the eBook publishing operations previously carried on through its wholly-owned
operating subsidiary. 

On
October 2, 2019, the Company announced that Tan Sri Dato Sri Lai Teck Peng, the Chief Executive Officer and sole director of the
Company, passed away on August 27, 2019 in Malaysia. 

On
the same day, the late Tan Sri Dato Sri Lai Teck Peng was being removed from the position of Chief Executive Officer and sole
director of the Company due to his sudden demise whereby Puan Sri Datin Sri Tan Chin Yee, spouse of the late Tan Sri Dato Sri
Lai Teck Peng, was being appointed as the Chief Executive Officer and director of Trendmaker, Inc. Limited, effective immediately. As
of December 31, 2022, Puan Sri Datin Sri Tan Chin Yee own 78.34 common stock of the company. 

Current
Operations 

Following
the change of control on February 29, 2016, the Company intends to engage in the business of acting as an investment holding company
and providing management and consulting services. 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company has engaged in limited business operations, but it has agreed to provide management and consulting
services to Trendmaker Pte. Ltd., a Singapore entity whose subsidiaries include Phyto Science Sdn Bhd (a Malaysia entity). Through its
subsidiaries, Trendmaker Pte. Ltd. is engaged in the sale of healthcare and wellness products in Asia via a multilevel marketing platform.
The management and consulting services which the Company will provide to Trendmaker Pte. Ltd. and its operating subsidiaries include
advice regarding investor and public relations, market strategies, structuring of mergers, acquisitions, strategic relationships and
alliances, obtaining debts or equity financing, and such other matters as the parties shall mutually agree upon. 

Employees 

As
of December 31, 2022, and the date of this report, the Company has no employees. 

Competition 

The
business of acting as an investment holding company and providing management and consulting services is extremely competitive. These
are areas in which the Company is currently in the process of commencing operations, and there is no assurance we will be able to successfully
compete. Most, if not all of our competitors, are expected to be larger, better funded and more experienced than us. 

Intellectual
Property 

The
Company does not currently own any trademarks, patents or other intellectual property which it uses or intends to use in the conduct
of its business operations.

Background 

The
Company was incorporated in August 21, 2013, to engage in the business of eBook publishing, but its business operations in the area of
eBook publishing were nominal. Following a change of control which occurred in February 29, 2016, the Company discontinued its eBook
publishing operations and elected to become an investment holding company and to provide management and consulting services to Trendmaker
Pte, Ltd, a Singapore entity whose subsidiaries include Phyto Science Sdn Bhd (a Malaysia entity), and Phytoscience Trendmaker Pvt Ltd
(an Indian entity). Although the Company identified its intended future business activities, during the fiscal year ended December 31,
2022, it did not commence active business operations. 

Results
of Operations 

Company
management does not believe that a meaningful analysis can be made of the Company s results of operation for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2022 as compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. During both periods, its operations have been nominal and,
following a change of control in February 29, 2016, the Company elected to terminate its previous business plan to engage in eBook publishing,
and adopt a new business plan relating to acting as an investment holding company and providing management and consulting services. Operating
expenses consisting of professional fees and general and administrative expenses, were substantially the same of the two periods 39,990
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 46,891 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021). Revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 0 and 0 respectively. 

Going
Concern 

As
of December 31, 2022, the Company has an accumulated deficit of 866,647, capital deficiency of 40,127 and had a net loss of 39,990.
This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern
is dependent on the Company s ability to raise additional capital and implement its business plan. The financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Management is taking various
steps to provide the Company with the opportunity to continue as a going concern. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
cash balance at December 31, 2022 was 0 with 225,140 in outstanding liabilities. Total expenditures over the next 12 months are expected
to be approximately 50,000. If we experience a shortage of funds prior to generating revenues from operations we may utilize funds from
our directors, who have informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for operating costs, however they have no formal commitment,
arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to us. Management believes our current cash balance will not be sufficient to
fund our operations for the next six months. 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The
Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Trendmaker, Inc. Limited (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2021 and the related statements of operation and comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash
flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
 financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits
we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
7 to the financial statements, for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company has not established any source of revenue to
cover its operating costs. This condition raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 7. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Critical
Audit Matters 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to those charged with governance and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements
and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. We determined that there are no critical matters.

9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Pursuant
to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act ), the Company carried out an evaluation, with
the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief
Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under
Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s
CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to the Company s management, including the Company s CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure as a result of continuing material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. 

During
the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, our management identified material weaknesses related
to the lack of requisite U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) expertise of our Chief Financial Officer and our internal
bookkeeper. This lack of expertise to prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP without the assistance of the outside
accounting consultant hired to ensure that our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP constitutes a material
weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. In order to mitigate the material weakness, we engaged an outside accounting
consultant to assist us in the preparation of our financial statements to ensure that these financial statements are prepared in conformity
to U.S. GAAP. This outside accounting consultant has significant experience in the preparation of financial statements in conformity
with U.S. GAAP. We believe that the engagement of this consultant will lessen the possibility that a material misstatement of our annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, and we will continue to monitor the effectiveness
of this action and make any changes that our management deems appropriate. We expect to continue to rely on this outside consulting arrangement
to supplement our internal accounting staff for the foreseeable future. Until such time as we hire the proper internal accounting staff
with the requisite U.S. GAAP experience, however, it is unlikely we will be able to remediate the material weakness in our internal control
over financial reporting.

Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting 

The
management of the Company is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and related financial information appearing
in this Annual Report on Form 10-KT. The financial statements and notes have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. The management of the Company also is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. A company s internal
control over financial reporting is defined as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that
in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Management
does not expect that the Company s disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Because of its
inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that
the objectives of the control system are met and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, over time control may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

With
the participation of the President and Chief Financial Officer, our management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based upon the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that evaluation, and due to the identified
material weakness and internal control deficiency as discussed above, and the fact that the Company has failed to stay current in the
filing of required periodic reports with the SEC, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company s internal
control over financial reporting was not effective. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting
firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter, that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Director
Independence 

The
NASDAQ Stock Market has instituted director independence guidelines that have been adopted by the Securities Exchange Commission.
These guidelines provide that a director is deemed independent only if the board of directors affirmatively determines
that the director has no relationship with the company which, in the board s opinion, would interfere with the director s
exercise of independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities. Significant stock ownership will not, by itself, preclude
a board finding of independence. 

Based
upon the guidelines described above, Puan Sri Datin Sri Tan Chin Yee is not an independent director under these rules.
