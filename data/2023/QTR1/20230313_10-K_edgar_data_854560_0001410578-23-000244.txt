 PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS. THE COMPANY Great Southern Bancorp, Inc. Great Southern Bancorp, Inc. Bancorp or Company is a bank holding company, a financial holding company and the parent of Great Southern Bank Great Southern or the Bank ). Bancorp was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in July 1989 as a unitary savings and loan holding company. The Company became a one-bank holding company on June 30, 1998, upon the conversion of Great Southern to a Missouri-chartered trust company. In 2004, Bancorp was re-incorporated under the laws of the State of Maryland. As a Maryland corporation, the Company is authorized to engage in any activity that is permitted by the Maryland General Corporation Law and not prohibited by law or regulatory policy. The Company currently conducts its business as a financial holding company. Through the financial holding company structure, it is possible to expand the size and scope of the financial services offered by the Company beyond those offered by the Bank, although the Company has not yet chosen to offer financial services beyond those offered by the Bank. The financial holding company structure provides the Company with greater flexibility than the Bank has to diversify its business activities, through existing or newly formed subsidiaries, or through acquisitions of or mergers with other financial institutions as well as other companies. At December 31, 2022, Bancorp s consolidated total assets were 5.68 billion, consolidated net loans were 4.51 billion, consolidated deposits were 4.68 billion and consolidated total stockholders equity was 533.1 million. For details about the Company s assets, revenues and profits for each of the last five fiscal years, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The assets of the Company at the holding company level consist primarily of the stock of Great Southern and cash. Through the Bank and subsidiaries of the Bank, the Company primarily offers a variety of banking and banking-related services, which are discussed further below. The activities of the Company are funded by retained earnings and through dividends from Great Southern. Activities of the Company may also be funded through borrowings from third parties or sales of additional securities. The executive offices of the Company are located at 1451 East Battlefield, Springfield, Missouri, 65804, and its telephone number at that address is (417) 887-4400. Great Southern Bank Great Southern was formed as a Missouri-chartered mutual savings and loan association in 1923, and, in 1989, converted to a Missouri-chartered stock savings and loan association. In 1994, Great Southern changed to a federal savings bank charter and then, on June 30, 1998, changed to a Missouri-chartered trust company (the equivalent of a commercial bank charter). Headquartered in Springfield, Missouri, Great Southern offers a broad range of banking services through its 92 banking centers located in southern and central Missouri; the Kansas City, Missouri area; the St. Louis area; eastern Kansas; northwestern Arkansas; the Minneapolis area and eastern, western and central Iowa. At December 31, 2022, the Bank had total assets of 5.68 billion, net loans of 4.51 billion, deposits of 4.71 billion and equity capital of 608.4 million, or 10.7 of total assets. Its deposits are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund DIF to the maximum levels permitted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ).

 The size and complexity of the Bank s operations increased substantially in 2009 with the completion of two FDIC-assisted transactions, and again in 2011, 2012 and 2014 with the completion of another FDIC-assisted transaction in each of those years. In 2009, the Bank entered into two separate purchase and assumption agreements (including loss sharing) with the FDIC to assume all of the deposits (excluding brokered deposits) and certain liabilities and acquire certain assets of TeamBank, N.A. and Vantus Bank. In these two transactions we acquired assets with a fair value of approximately 499.9 million (approximately 18.8 of the Company s total consolidated assets at acquisition) and 294.2 million (approximately 8.8 of the Company s total consolidated assets at acquisition), respectively, and assumed liabilities with a fair value of 610.2 million (approximately 24.9 of the Company s total consolidated assets at acquisition) and 440.0 million (approximately 13.2 of the Company s total consolidated assets at acquisition), respectively. They also resulted in gains of 43.9 million and 45.9 million, respectively, which were included in Non-interest Income in the Company s Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2009. Prior to these acquisitions, the Company operated banking centers in Missouri with loan production offices in Arkansas and Kansas. These acquisitions added 31 banking centers and expanded our footprint to cover five states Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas and Nebraska. In 2011, the Bank entered into a purchase and assumption agreement (including loss sharing) with the FDIC to assume all of the deposits and certain liabilities and acquire certain assets of Sun Security Bank, which added locations in southern Missouri and St. Louis. In this transaction we acquired assets with a fair value of approximately 248.9 million (approximately 7.3 of the Company s total consolidated assets at acquisition) and assumed liabilities with a fair value of 345.8 million (approximately 10.1 of the Company s total consolidated assets at acquisition). It also resulted in a gain of 16.5 million which was included in Non-interest Income in the Company s Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. In 2012, the Bank entered into a purchase and assumption agreement (including loss sharing) with the FDIC to assume all of the deposits and certain liabilities and acquire certain assets of Inter Savings Bank, FSB InterBank ), which added four locations in the greater Minneapolis area and represented a new market for the Company. In this transaction we acquired assets with a fair value of approximately 364.2 million (approximately 9.4 of the Company s total consolidated assets at acquisition) and assumed liabilities with a fair value of approximately 458.7 million (approximately 11.9 of the Company s total consolidated assets at acquisition). It also resulted in a gain of 31.3 million which was included in Non-interest Income in the Company s Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2012. In 2014, the Bank entered into a purchase and assumption agreement (without loss sharing) with the FDIC to assume all of the deposits and certain liabilities and acquire certain assets of Valley Bank Valley ), which added five locations in the Quad Cities area of eastern Iowa and six locations in central Iowa, primarily in the Des Moines market area. These represented new markets for the Company in eastern Iowa and enhanced our market presence in central Iowa. In this transaction we acquired assets with a fair value of approximately 378.7 million (approximately 10.0 of the Company s total consolidated assets at acquisition) and assumed liabilities with a fair value of approximately 367.9 million (approximately 9.8 of the Company s total consolidated assets at acquisition). It also resulted in a gain of 10.8 million which was included in Non-interest Income in the Company s Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2014. Also in 2014, the Bank entered into a purchase and assumption agreement to acquire certain assets and depository accounts from Neosho, Missouri-based Boulevard Bank Boulevard ), which added one location in the Neosho, Missouri market, where the Company already operated a banking center. In this transaction, we acquired assets (primarily cash and cash equivalents) with a fair value of approximately 92.5 million (approximately 2.6 of the Company s total consolidated assets at acquisition) and assumed liabilities (all deposits and related accrued interest) with a fair value of approximately 93.3 million (approximately 2.6 of the Company s total consolidated assets at acquisition). This acquisition resulted in recognition of 790,000 of goodwill. The Company also opened commercial loan production offices in Dallas, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, during 2014. The primary products offered in these offices are commercial real estate, commercial business and commercial construction loans. In 2015, the Company announced plans to consolidate operations of 16 of its banking centers into other nearby Great Southern banking center locations. As part of an ongoing performance review of its entire banking center network, Great Southern evaluated each location for a number of criteria, including access and availability of services to affected customers, the proximity of other Great Southern banking centers, profitability and transaction volumes, and market dynamics. Subsequent to this announcement, the Bank entered into separate definitive agreements to sell two of the 16 banking centers, including all of the associated deposits (totaling approximately 20 million), to separate bank purchasers. One of those sale transactions was completed on February 19, 2016 and the other was completed on March 18, 2016. The closing of the remaining 14 facilities, which resulted in the transfer of approximately 127 million in deposits and banking center operations to other Great Southern locations, occurred at the close of business on January 8, 2016.

 Also in 2015, the Company announced that it entered into a purchase and assumption agreement to acquire 12 branches, including related loans, and to assume related deposits in the St. Louis area from Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bank. The acquisition was completed at the close of business on January 29, 2016. The deposits assumed totaled approximately 228 million and the loans acquired totaled approximately 159 million. The loss sharing agreements related to the FDIC-assisted transactions in 2009, 2011 and 2012 added to the complexity of our operations by creating the need for new employees and processes to ensure compliance with the loss sharing agreements and the collection of problem assets acquired. See Note 4 included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Information for a more detailed discussion of these FDIC-assisted transactions and the loss sharing agreements. The loss sharing agreements related to the 2009 and 2011 FDIC-assisted transactions were terminated during 2016. The loss sharing agreements related to the 2012 FDIC-assisted transaction were terminated during 2017. The Company opened a commercial loan production office in Chicago during 2017. The primary products offered in this office are commercial real estate, commercial business and commercial construction loans. In March 2018, the Bank entered into a definitive agreement to sell its four banking centers, including all of the associated deposits (totaling approximately 56 million), in the Omaha, Nebraska market to Lincoln, Nebraska-based West Gate Bank. This sale transaction was completed in July 2018. The Company opened two commercial loan production offices one in Denver and one in Atlanta in late 2018. The primary products offered in these offices are commercial real estate, commercial business and commercial construction loans. In March 2019, the Company ceased operating its indirect automobile financing unit. Market forces, including strong rate competition for well-qualified borrowers, made indirect lending through automobile dealerships a significant challenge to efficient and profitable operations over the long term. In addition, indirect loan balances had significantly declined in 2018 and 2019 after tightened underwriting guidelines were implemented by the Company in the latter part of 2016, in response to more challenging consumer credit conditions. The Company continues to offer direct consumer loans through its banking center network. In April 2019, the Company consolidated its Fayetteville, Arkansas, location into its Rogers, Arkansas, banking center. The Company now operates one banking center in Arkansas. In September 2019, the Company consolidated its Ames, Iowa, banking center into its North Ankeny, Iowa, office. The Company entered the Ames market with only one banking center through the Valley Bank FDIC-assisted acquisition in 2014. In April 2020, the Company was notified by its landlord that the Great Southern banking centers located inside the Hy-Vee stores at 2900 Devils Glen Rd in Bettendorf, Iowa, and 2351 W. Locust St. in Davenport, Iowa, had to permanently cease operations at those locations due to store infrastructure changes. Customer accounts were transferred to nearby offices. Great Southern operates three banking centers in the Quad Cities market area two in Davenport and one in Bettendorf. In August 2020, remodeling of the downtown office at 1900 Main in Parsons, Kansas, was completed, which included the addition of drive-thru banking lanes. With this completion, the nearby drive-thru facility was consolidated into the downtown office, leaving one location serving the Parsons market. In September 2021, the Company opened a new banking center at 2801 E. 32nd Street in Joplin, Missouri, replacing a nearby leased office. The Company currently has two banking centers serving the Joplin market. In November 2021, the Company consolidated one banking center in the St. Louis region. The Westfall Plaza banking center was consolidated into a Great Southern office less than three miles away. In August 2022, the Company consolidated one banking center in the St. Louis region. The Clayton office was consolidated into the nearby Brentwood banking center. The Company continues to operate commercial lending services from the Clayton office building. The Company now operates 17 banking centers serving the greater St. Louis area. Also in August 2022, a newly-constructed banking center opened in Kimberling City, Missouri. The new banking center replaced the former facility located on the same property.

 The Company opened two commercial loan production offices one in Phoenix and one in Charlotte in 2022. The primary products offered in these offices are commercial real estate, commercial business and commercial construction loans. Great Southern is principally engaged in the business of originating commercial real estate loans, construction loans, other commercial loans, multi-family and single-family residential real estate loans and consumer loans and funding these loans by attracting deposits from the general public, obtaining brokered deposits and through borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (the FHLBank and others. For many years, Great Southern has followed a strategy of emphasizing loan originations through residential, commercial and consumer lending activities in its market areas. The goal of this strategy is to be one of the leading providers of financial services in Great Southern s market areas, while simultaneously diversifying assets and reducing interest rate risk by originating and holding adjustable-rate loans and fixed-rate loans, primarily with terms of five years or less, in its portfolio and by selling longer-term fixed-rate single-family mortgage loans in the secondary market. The Bank continues to emphasize real estate lending while also expanding and increasing its originations of commercial business loans. The corporate office of Great Southern is located at 218 South Glenstone, Springfield, Missouri, 65802 and its telephone number at that address is (417) 887-4400. Internet Website Bancorp maintains a website at www.greatsouthernbank.com. The information contained on that website is not included as part of, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Bancorp currently makes available on or through its website Bancorp s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments, if any, to these reports. These materials are also available free of charge (other than a user s regular internet access charges) on the Securities and Exchange Commission s website at www.sec.gov. Market Areas The Company currently operates 92 full-service retail banking offices, serving nearly 134,000 households in six states Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Arkansas and Nebraska. The Company also operates commercial loan production offices in Atlanta; Charlotte; Chicago; Dallas; Denver; Omaha; Phoenix and Tulsa; and a mortgage lending office in Springfield, Missouri. The Company regularly evaluates its banking center network and lines of business to ensure that it is serving customers in the best way possible. The banking center network constantly evolves with changes in customer needs and preferences, emerging technology and local market developments. In response to these changes, the Company opens banking centers and invests resources where customer demand leads, and from time to time, consolidates banking centers when market conditions dictate. Great Southern s largest concentrations of deposits and loans are in the Springfield, Missouri, and St. Louis, market areas. In the last several years, the Company s deposit and loan portfolios have become more diversified because of its history of five FDIC-assisted acquisitions and organic growth. The FDIC-assisted acquisitions significantly expanded the Company s geographic footprint, which prior to 2009 was primarily in southwest and central Missouri, by adding significant operations in Iowa, Kansas and Minnesota. Besides the Springfield and St. Louis market areas, the Company has deposit and loan concentrations in the following market areas: Kansas City, Missouri; Sioux City, Iowa; Des Moines, Iowa; Northwest Arkansas; Minneapolis; and Eastern Iowa in the area known as the Quad Cities. Deposits and loans are also generated in banking centers in rural markets in Missouri, Iowa, and Kansas. At December 31, 2022, the Company s total deposits were 4.68 billion. At that date, the Company had deposits in Missouri of 3.40 billion, which included its two largest deposit concentrations, in the Springfield and St. Louis areas, with 1.44 billion and 708 million, respectively. At December 31, 2022, the Company also had deposits of 770 million in Iowa, 300 million in Kansas, 188 million in Minnesota, 24 million in Nebraska and 36 million in Arkansas. The Company has commercial loan production offices in Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Omaha, Phoenix and Tulsa. These offices generate a significant percentage of the Company s commercial loan production. Commercial lending groups in our Kansas City, Des Moines, Minneapolis, Springfield, and St. Louis banking offices also generate a significant percentage of the Company s commercial loan production.

 Lending Activities General From its beginnings in 1923 through the early 1980s, Great Southern primarily made long-term, fixed-rate residential real estate loans that it retained in its loan portfolio. Beginning in the early 1980s, Great Southern increased its efforts to originate short-term and adjustable-rate loans. Beginning in the mid-1980s, Great Southern increased its efforts to originate commercial real estate and other residential (multi-family) loans, primarily with adjustable rates or shorter-term fixed rates. In addition, some competitor banking organizations merged with larger institutions and changed their business practices or moved operations away from the Springfield, Missouri area, and others consolidated operations from the Springfield, Missouri area to larger cities. This provided Great Southern expanded opportunities in residential and commercial real estate lending as well as in the origination of commercial business and consumer loans in the Springfield, Missouri area. In addition to originating loans, the Bank has expanded and enlarged its relationships with other banks of varying asset sizes to purchase participations (at par, generally with no servicing costs) in loans these other banks originate but are unable to retain the entire balance in their portfolios due to capital or borrower relationship size limitations. The Bank uses the same underwriting guidelines in evaluating these participations as it does in its direct loan originations. At December 31, 2022, the balance of loan participations purchased and held in the portfolio was 320.0 million, or 7.1 of the total loan portfolio. All of these loan participations were performing at December 31, 2022. Of the total 320.0 million of purchased participation loans outstanding at December 31, 2022, the largest aggregate amount outstanding purchased from one institution was 52.7 million. This amount was comprised of 11 loans, five of which were secured by warehouses, four were secured by hotels, one was secured by a commercial land and development project in the St. Louis area and one was secured by a multifamily housing project in the St. Louis area. One of the principal historical lending activities of Great Southern is the origination of fixed and adjustable-rate conventional residential real estate loans to enable borrowers to purchase or refinance owner-occupied homes. Great Southern originates a variety of conventional residential real estate mortgage loans, principally in compliance with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae standards for resale in the secondary market. Great Southern promptly sells most of the fixed-rate residential mortgage loans that it originates. To date, Great Southern has not experienced difficulties selling these loans in the secondary market and has had minimal repurchase requests. Depending on market conditions, the ongoing servicing of these loans is at times retained by Great Southern, but generally servicing is released to the purchaser of the loan. Great Southern retains in its portfolio substantially all of the adjustable-rate mortgage loans that it originates. Another principal lending activity of Great Southern is the origination of commercial real estate, other residential (multi-family) and multi-family and commercial construction loans. Since the early 1990s, commercial real estate, other residential (multi-family) and multi-family and commercial construction loans have represented the largest percentage of the loan portfolio. At December 31, 2022, commercial real estate, other residential (multi-family) and multi-family and commercial construction loans accounted for approximately 34 , 17 and 17 , respectively, of the total outstanding portfolio. In addition, one- to four-family residential loans accounted for approximately 20 of the total outstanding portfolio. Great Southern in recent years has also increased its emphasis on the origination of other commercial loans and home equity loans, and also has issued letters of credit. Letters of credit are contingent obligations and are not included in the Bank s loan portfolio. See - Other Commercial Lending, - Classified Assets, and Loan Delinquencies and Defaults below.

 The percentage of collateral value Great Southern will loan on real estate and other property varies based on factors including, but not limited to, the type of property and its location and the borrower s credit history. As a general rule, Great Southern will loan up to 95 of the appraised value on one-to four-family residential properties. Typically, private mortgage insurance is required for loan amounts above the 80 level. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, loans secured by second liens on residential properties were 82.3 million, or 1.8 , and 78.5 million, or 1.9 , respectively, of our total loan portfolio. For commercial real estate and other residential real property loans, Great Southern may loan up to 85 of the appraised value. The origination of loans secured by other property is considered and determined on an individual basis by management with the assistance of any industry guides and other information which may be available. Collateral values are reappraised or reassessed as loans are renewed or when significant events indicating potential impairment occur. On a quarterly basis, management reviews individually evaluated loans to determine whether updated appraisals or reassessments are necessary based on loan performance, collateral type and guarantor support. While not specifically required by our policy, we seek to obtain cross-collateralization of loans to a borrower when it is available and it is most frequently done on commercial real estate loans. Loan applications are approved at various levels of authority, depending on the type, amount and loan-to-value ratio of the loan. Loan commitments of 5,000,000 or more (or loans exceeding the Freddie Mac loan limit in the case of fixed-rate, one- to four-family residential loans for resale) must be approved by Great Southern s loan committee. The loan committee is comprised of the Chief Executive Officer of the Bank, the Chief Credit Officer (chairman of the committee), Chief Lending Officer, Director of Commercial Lending, Director of Credit Underwriting, and other Regional Managing Directors of the Bank involved in lending activities. All loans, regardless of size or type, are required to conform to minimum underwriting standards to assure portfolio quality. These standards and procedures include, but are not limited to, an analysis of the borrower s financial condition, collateral, repayment ability, verification of liquid assets and credit history as required by loan type. It has been, and continues to be, our practice to verify information from potential borrowers regarding assets, income or payment ability and credit ratings as applicable and as required by the authority approving the loan. Underwriting standards also include loan-to-value ratios, which vary depending on collateral type, debt service coverage ratios or debt payment to income ratios, where applicable, credit histories, use of guaranties and other recommended terms relating to equity requirements, amortization, and maturity. Generally, deviations from approved underwriting standards may only be allowed when doing so is not in violation of regulations or statutes and when appropriate lending authority is obtained. The loan committee reviews all new loan originations in excess of lender approval authorities. For secured loans originated and held, most lenders have approval authorities of 250,000 or below while twelve Senior Managers have approval authority of varying amounts up to 2 million. Lender approval authorities are also subject to loans-to-one borrower limits of 500,000 or below for most lenders and of varying amounts up to 5 million for fourteen Senior Managers and Underwriters. In general, state banking laws restrict loans to a single borrower and related entities to no more than 25 of a bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, plus an additional 10 if the loan is collateralized by certain readily marketable collateral. (Real estate is not included in the definition of readily marketable collateral. As computed on the basis of the Bank s unimpaired capital and surplus at December 31, 2022, this limit was approximately 180.4 million. See Government Supervision and Regulation. At December 31, 2022, the Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limit. At December 31, 2022, the Bank s largest relationship for purposes of this limit, which consists of twelve loans, totaled 98.6 million. This amount represents the total commitment for this relationship at December 31, 2022; the outstanding balance at that date was 88.0 million. Eight loans had an undisbursed credit line. The collateral for the loans consist of multiple industrial real estate projects. In addition, we obtained personal guarantees from the principal owner of the borrowing entities for each of these loans. All loans included in this relationship were current at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, we also had nine other loan relationships that each exceeded 50 million. All loans included in these relationships were current at December 31, 2022. Our policy does not set a loans-to-one borrower limit that is below the legal limits described; however, we do recognize the need to limit credit risk to any one borrower or group of related borrowers upon consideration of various risk factors. Extensions of credit to borrowers whose past due loans were charged-off or whose loans are classified as substandard require special lending approval. Great Southern is permitted under applicable regulations to originate or purchase loans and loan participations secured by real estate located in any part of the United States. In addition to the market areas where the Company has offices, the Bank has made or purchased loans, secured primarily by commercial real estate, in other states, primarily Florida, Michigan and Wisconsin. At December 31, 2022, loans in these states comprised 3 or less each, respectively, of the total loan portfolio.

At December 31, 2021, 78.5 million, or 1.9 , of total loans were secured by junior lien mortgages and 11.7 million, or 2.0 of residential real estate loans, were interest only residential real estate loans. While high loan-to-value ratio mortgage loans are occasionally originated and held, they are typically either considered low risk based on analyses performed or are required to have private mortgage insurance. The Company does not originate or hold option ARM loans or significant amounts of loans with initial teaser rates or subprime loans in its residential real estate portfolio. To monitor and control risks related to concentrations of credit in the composition of the loan portfolio, management reviews the loan portfolio by loan types, industries and market areas on a monthly basis for credit quality and known and anticipated market conditions. Changes in loan portfolio composition may be made by management based on the performance of each area of business, known and anticipated market conditions, credit demands, the deposit structure of the Bank and the expertise and/or depth of the lending staff. Loan portfolio industry and market areas are monitored regularly for credit quality and trends. Reports detailed by industry and geography are provided to the Board of Directors on a monthly and quarterly basis. The composition of the Bank s loan portfolio has changed over the past several years; speculative construction and land development loan types have been limited, consumer lending for automobiles and boats has decreased significantly (indirect automobile and boat lending was eliminated), commercial real estate loan types have been stabilized and diversified and emphasis has been placed on increasing our other residential (multi-family) and commercial business loan portfolios.

 Environmental Issues Loans secured by real property, whether commercial, residential or other, may have a material, negative effect on the financial position and results of operations of the lender if the collateral is environmentally contaminated. The result can be, but is not necessarily limited to, liability for the cost of cleaning up the contamination imposed on the lender by certain federal and state laws, a reduction in the borrower s ability to pay because of the liability imposed upon it for any clean-up costs, a reduction in the value of the collateral because of the presence of contamination or a subordination of security interests in the collateral to a super priority lien securing the cleanup costs by certain state laws. Management is aware of the risk that the Bank may be negatively affected by environmentally contaminated collateral and attempts to control this risk through commercially reasonable methods, consistent with guidelines arising from applicable government or regulatory rules and regulations, and to a more limited extent, publications of the lending industry. Management currently is unaware (without, in many circumstances, specific inquiry or investigation of existing collateral, some of which was accepted as collateral before risk controlling measures were implemented) of any environmental contamination of real property securing loans in the Bank s portfolio that would subject the Bank to any material risk. No assurance can be given, however, that the Bank will not be adversely affected by environmental contamination. Residential Real Estate Lending At December 31, 2022 and 2021, loans secured by residential real estate, excluding that which is under construction, totaled 1.7 billion and 1.4 billion, respectively, and represented approximately 36.8 and 34.0 , respectively, of the Bank s total loan portfolio. The Bank s one- to four-family residential real estate loan portfolio increased during 2022, due to organic growth. In the first half of 2022, new loan origination volumes were strong and consistent with levels seen in the past couple of years. As residential loan rates began to increase significantly along with the increase in market interest rates, much of the Bank s one- to four-family loans originated in 2022 were adjustable rate loans which are fixed for a period of a few years, then adjust annually. For many years, other residential (multi-family) loan balances had increased as the Bank emphasized this type of loan. The exception to this was in 2021, when loan balances decreased due to projects refinancing or being sold and paying off at a faster pace. The Bank s outstanding other residential (multi-family) loan portfolio increased by approximately 12.0 in 2022 partly due to refinancings and early pay-offs on these types of loans slowing as interest rates increased. The Bank currently is originating one- to four-family adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans primarily with one-year adjustment periods or with rates that are fixed for the first few years of the loan and then adjust annually. Rate adjustments on loans originated prior to July 2001 are based upon changes in prevailing rates for one-year U.S. Treasury securities. Rate adjustments on loans originated since July 2001 are based upon either changes in the average of interbank offered rates for twelve-month U.S. Dollar-denominated deposits in the London Market (LIBOR) or changes in prevailing rates for one-year U.S. Treasury securities. Rate adjustments are generally limited to 2 maximum annually as well as a maximum aggregate adjustment over the life of the loan. Accordingly, the interest rates on these loans typically may not be as rate sensitive as is the Bank s cost of funds. Generally, the Bank s adjustable-rate mortgage loans are not convertible into fixed-rate loans, do not permit negative amortization of principal and carry no prepayment penalty. The Bank also currently is originating other residential (multi-family) mortgage loans with interest rates that are generally either adjustable with changes to the prime rate of interest or fixed for short periods of time (three to seven years). LIBOR interest rates are expected to be phased out in 2023 and be replaced with other market index rates. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Relating to the Company and the Bank Risks Relating to Market Interest Rates The replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate may adversely affect us. Since the adjustable-rate mortgage loans currently held in the Bank s portfolio have not been subject to an interest rate environment which causes them to adjust to the maximum, these loans entail unquantifiable risks resulting from potential increased payment obligations on the borrower as a result of upward repricing. Until 2022, the indices used by Great Southern for these types of loans have increased, but not significantly, at various times in the past ten years. In 2022, twelve-month LIBOR and one-year U.S. Treasury interest rates increased substantially compared to prior years. Compared to fixed-rate mortgage loans, these loans are subject to increased risk of delinquency or default if a higher, fully-indexed rate of interest subsequently comes into effect in replacement of a lower rate currently in effect. From 2008 through 2012, as a result of the significant recession in the economy, including residential real estate, the Bank experienced a significant increase in delinquencies in adjustable-rate mortgage loans. In 2013 through 2022, these delinquencies trended much lower.

 In underwriting one- to four-family residential real estate loans, Great Southern evaluates the borrower s ability to make monthly payments and the value of the property securing the loan. It is the policy of Great Southern that generally all one- to four-family residential loans in excess of 80 of the appraised value of the property be insured by a private mortgage insurance company approved by Great Southern for the amount of the loan in excess of 80 of the appraised value. In addition, Great Southern requires borrowers to obtain title and fire and casualty insurance in an amount not less than the amount of the loan. Real estate loans originated by the Bank generally contain a due on sale clause allowing the Bank to declare the unpaid principal balance due and payable upon the sale of the property securing the loan. The Bank may enforce these due on sale clauses to the extent permitted by law. Commercial Real Estate and Construction Lending Commercial real estate lending has been a significant part of Great Southern s business activities since the mid-1980s. Great Southern engages in commercial real estate lending in order to increase the potential yield on, and the proportion of interest rate sensitive loans in, its portfolio. At December 31, 2008, commercial real estate loans and commercial construction loans each made up about one fourth of the total loan portfolio. The economic recession that began in 2008 resulted in reduced activity in the market caused by the downturn in the economy and reduced real estate values. In response, Great Southern began limiting residential and commercial land development lending to reduce the risk in the portfolio and began originating more commercial real estate loans. Since December 31, 2008, the commercial construction loan portfolio (including multi-family residential construction) has decreased from 32 of the loan portfolio to 17 of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2022, while, overall, the percentage of commercial real estate loans in the total loan portfolio has trended upward, and was about 34 of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2022. Over the last five years, commercial real estate loans made up approximately 34-37 of the total loan portfolio while outstanding commercial construction loans (including multi-family residential construction) were 12-17 . The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted commercial real estate lending activity in 2020, but activity generally resumed at pre-pandemic levels in 2021 and 2022. See Government Supervision and Regulation below. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, loans secured by commercial real estate, excluding that which is under construction, totaled 1.5 billion and 1.5 billion, respectively, or approximately 33.7 and 36.5 , respectively, of the Bank s total loan portfolio. In addition, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, construction loans secured by projects under construction and the land on which the projects are located aggregated 865.2 million and 720.3 million, respectively, or 18.9 and 17.6 , respectively, of the Bank s total loan portfolio. A majority of the Bank s commercial real estate loans have been originated with adjustable rates of interest, most of which are tied either to the national prime rate or LIBOR/SOFR interest rates, or fixed rates of interest with short-term maturities. A large majority of the Bank s commercial real estate loans (both fixed and adjustable) mature in five years or less. Substantially all of these loans were originated with loan commitments which did not exceed 80 of the appraised value of the properties securing the loans. Beyond the outstanding balance of our construction loans, our loan portfolio possesses increased risk due to the amount of unfunded portions of commercial, residential and other residential (multi-family) construction loans. At December 31, 2022, we had 1.43 billion in the unfunded portion of construction loans which have been closed, but are not yet fully funded. These balances are managed through the Bank s various risk management processes. Management considers both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet transactions in its evaluation of the Company s liquidity. The nature of these commitments is such that the likelihood of funding them in the aggregate at any one time is low. The Bank s construction loans generally have a term of eighteen months or less. The construction loan agreements for one- to four-family projects generally require principal reductions as individual condominium units or single-family houses are built and sold to a third party. This ensures that the remaining loan balance, as a proportion of the value of the remaining security, does not increase, assuming that the value of the remaining security does not decrease. Loan proceeds are disbursed in increments as construction progresses. Generally, the amount of each disbursement is based on the construction cost estimate with inspections of the project performed in connection with each disbursement request. Normally, Great Southern s commercial real estate and other residential construction loans are made either as the initial stage of a combination loan (i.e., with a commitment from the Bank to provide permanent financing upon completion of the project) or with a commitment from a third party to provide permanent financing.

 The Bank s commercial real estate and construction loan portfolios consist of loans with diverse collateral types. The following table sets forth loans that were secured by certain types of collateral at December 31, 2022. These collateral types represent the five highest percentage concentrations of commercial real estate and construction loan types in the loan portfolio. 

Percentage of Non-Performing Total Loan Loans at Collateral Type Loan Balance Portfolio December 31, 2022 (Dollars In Thousands) Retail (Varied Projects) 328,639 7.2 0 Warehouses 306,827 6.7 0 Health Care Facilities 282,878 6.2 0 Motels/Hotels 275,159 6.0 0 Office Industry 256,620 5.6 0 Commercial real estate lending and construction lending generally affords the Bank an opportunity to receive interest at rates higher than those obtainable from residential mortgage lending and to receive higher origination and other loan fees. In addition, commercial real estate loans and construction loans are generally made with adjustable rates of interest or, if made on a fixed-rate basis, for relatively short terms. Commercial real estate lending does, however, entail significant additional risks as compared with residential mortgage lending. Commercial real estate loans typically involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the payment experience on loans secured by commercial properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate project and thus may be subject, to a greater extent, to adverse conditions in the real estate market or in the economy generally. Construction loans involve additional risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced based on the value of the project under construction, which is of uncertain value prior to the completion of construction. Moreover, because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, delays arising from labor shortages and other problems, material shortages, and other unpredictable contingencies, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total loan funds required to complete a project, and the related loan-to-value ratios. See also the discussion under the headings - Classified Assets and - Loan Delinquencies and Defaults below. The Company executes interest rate swaps with certain commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. The Company began offering this service during 2011. Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting interest rate swaps that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. As the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had six interest rate swaps and one interest rate cap totaling 107.0 million in notional amount with commercial customers, and six interest rate swaps and one interest rate cap with the same notional amount with third parties related to this program. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 11 interest rate swaps and one interest rate cap totaling 93.9 million in notional amount with commercial customers, and 11 interest rate swaps and one interest rate cap with the same notional amount with third parties related to this program. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized net gains of 321,000 and 312,000 respectively, in non-interest income related to changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps. Other Commercial Lending At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Great Southern had 293 million and 281 million, respectively, in other commercial loans outstanding, or 6.4 and 6.9 , respectively, of the Bank s total loan portfolio. Great Southern s other commercial lending activities encompass loans with a variety of purposes and security, including loans to finance accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Great Southern expects to continue to originate loans in this category subject to market conditions and applicable regulatory restrictions. See Government Supervision and Regulation below. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from his or her employment and other income and which are secured by real property, the value of which tends to be more easily ascertainable, other commercial loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower s business. Commercial loans are generally secured by business assets, such as accounts receivable, equipment and inventory. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of other commercial loans may be substantially dependent on the

 success of the business itself. Further, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. The Bank s management recognizes the generally increased risks associated with other commercial lending. Great Southern s commercial lending policy emphasizes complete credit file documentation and analysis of the borrower s character, capacity to repay the loan, the adequacy of the borrower s capital and collateral as well as an evaluation of the industry conditions affecting the borrower. Review of the borrower s past, present and future cash flows is also an important aspect of Great Southern s credit analysis. In addition, the Bank generally obtains personal guarantees from the borrowers on these types of loans. Historically, the majority of Great Southern s commercial loans have been to borrowers in southwestern and central Missouri and the St. Louis, Missouri area. With the FDIC-assisted acquisitions in 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2014, geographic concentrations for commercial loans expanded to include the greater Kansas City, Missouri area, several areas in Iowa, and the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Great Southern has continued its commercial lending in all of these geographic areas as well as through our loan production offices in Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Omaha, Phoenix and Tulsa. As part of its commercial lending activities, Great Southern issues letters of credit and receives fees averaging approximately 1 of the amount of the letter of credit per year. At December 31, 2022, Great Southern had 54 letters of credit outstanding in the aggregate amount of 16.7 million. Approximately 33 of the aggregate dollar amount of these letters of credit was secured, including 15 letters of credit totaling 5.4 million secured by real estate. Consumer Lending Consumer loans generally have short terms to maturity, thus reducing Great Southern s exposure to changes in interest rates, and carry higher rates of interest than do residential mortgage loans. In addition, Great Southern believes offering consumer loan products helps expand and create stronger ties to its existing customer base. Great Southern offers a variety of secured consumer loans, including automobile loans, boat loans, home equity loans and loans secured by savings deposits. In addition, Great Southern also offers home improvement loans and unsecured consumer loans. Consumer loans totaled 194 million and 207 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, or 4.2 and 5.0 , respectively, of the Bank s total loan portfolio. The underwriting standards employed by the Bank for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant s payment history on other debts and an assessment of ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the underlying collateral, if any, in relation to the proposed loan amount. Beginning in 1998, the Bank implemented indirect lending relationships, primarily with automobile dealerships. Through these dealer relationships, the dealer completes the application with the consumer and then submits it to the Bank for credit approval. While the Bank s initial and ongoing concentrated effort was on automobiles, the program evolved for use from time to time with other tangible products where financing of the product is provided through the seller, including, to a lesser extent, boats and manufactured homes. The environment for providing indirect automobile lending services has been difficult over the last several years. As indicated above, in the latter part of 2016, in response to more challenging consumer credit conditions, the Company tightened its underwriting guidelines on automobile lending. Management took this step in an effort to improve credit quality in the portfolio and lower delinquencies and charge-offs. The changes in underwriting guidelines resulted in lower origination volume, and as such, outstanding consumer auto loan balances have decreased significantly since the end of 2016. After a review of the indirect automobile lending model, the decision was made to exit this business line effective March 31, 2019. Market and financial forces, including strong rate competition for well-qualified borrowers, have made indirect automobile lending less profitable over the long term. The Company will continue servicing indirect automobile loans made before March 31, 2019, until each loan agreement is satisfied. Direct consumer lending through the Company s banking center network is expected to continue as normal.

 At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank had 70.2 million and 86.1 million, respectively, of direct and indirect auto, boat, modular home and recreational vehicle loans in its portfolio. Indirect consumer loans were 16 million and 31 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total indirect consumer loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 was comprised of the following types of loans: 4 million of used auto loans, 12 million of manufactured home loans and various other loans including loans for new autos, RVs, boats, ATVs and motorcycles. Consumer loans may entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciable assets such as automobiles. In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation. The remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial strength, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state consumer bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be recovered on these loans. These loans may also give rise to claims and defenses by a consumer loan borrower against an assignee of these loans such as the Bank, and a borrower may be able to assert against the assignee claims and defenses which it has against the seller of the underlying collateral. Originations, Purchases, Sales and Servicing of Loans The Bank originates loans through internal loan production personnel located in the Bank s main and branch offices, as well as loan production offices. Walk-in customers and referrals from existing customers of the Company are also important sources of loan originations. Great Southern may also purchase whole loans and participation interests in loans (generally without recourse, except in cases of breach of representation, warranty or covenant) from other banks, thrift institutions and life insurance companies (originators). The purchase transaction is governed by a participation agreement entered into by the originator and participant (Great Southern) containing guidelines as to ownership, control and servicing rights, among others. The originator may retain all rights with respect to enforcement, collection and administration of the loan. This may limit Great Southern s ability to control its credit risk when it purchases participations in these loans. For instance, the terms of participation agreements vary; however, generally Great Southern may not have direct access to the borrower, and the institution administering the loan may have some discretion in the administration of performing loans and the collection of non-performing loans. Over the years, a number of banks, both locally and regionally, have sought to diversify the risk in their portfolios. In order to take advantage of this situation, Great Southern purchases participations in commercial real estate, commercial construction and other commercial loans. Great Southern subjects these loans to its normal underwriting standards used for originated loans and rejects any credits that do not meet those guidelines. The originating bank generally retains the servicing of these loans. The Bank purchased 361.8 million and 152.8 million of these loans in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These balances represent the total loan amount, including the unfunded portion of loans purchased. At the time of purchase, these loans had outstanding funded balances of 27.8 million and 43.4 million, respectively. From time to time, Great Southern also sells non-residential loan participations generally without recourse to private investors, such as other banks, thrift institutions and life insurance companies (participants). The sales transaction is governed by a participation agreement entered into by the originator (Great Southern) and participant containing guidelines as to ownership, control and servicing rights, among others. Great Southern generally retains servicing rights for these participations sold. Great Southern also sells whole residential real estate loans without recourse to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae as well as to private investors, such as other banks, thrift institutions, mortgage companies and life insurance companies. Whole real estate loans are sold with a provision for repurchase upon breach of representation, warranty or covenant. These representations, warranties and covenants include those regarding the compliance of loan originations with all applicable legal requirements, mortgage title insurance policies when applicable, enforceable liens on collateral, collateral type, borrower creditworthiness, private mortgage insurance when required and compliance with all applicable federal regulations. A minimal number of repurchase requests have been received to date based on a breach of representations, warranties or covenants as outlined in the investor contracts. These loans are generally sold for cash in amounts equal to the unpaid principal amount of the loans adjusted for current market yields to the buyer. The sale amounts generally

Table of Contents 
 produce gains to the Bank and allow a margin for servicing income on loans when the servicing is retained by the Bank. However, residential real estate loans sold in recent years have primarily been with Great Southern releasing control of the servicing of the loans. The Bank sold one- to four-family whole real estate loans, SBA-guaranteed loans and loan participations in aggregate amounts of 100.8 million, 341.9 million and 309.1 million during fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The Bank typically sells long-term fixed rate mortgages. Sales of whole real estate loans and participations in real estate loans can be beneficial to the Bank since these sales generally generate income at the time of sale, produce future servicing income on loans where servicing is retained, provide funds for additional lending and other investments, and increase liquidity. Gains, losses and transfer fees on sales of loans and loan participations are recognized at the time of the sale. When real estate loans and loan participations sold have an average contractual interest rate that differs from the agreed upon yield to the purchaser (less the agreed upon servicing fee), resulting gains or losses are recognized in an amount equal to the present value of the differential over the estimated remaining life of the loans. Any resulting discount or premium is accreted or amortized over the same estimated life using a method approximating the level yield interest method. When real estate loans and loan participations are sold with servicing released, as the Bank primarily does, an additional fee is received for the servicing rights. Net gains and transfer fees on sales of loans for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were 2.6 million, 9.5 million and 8.1 million, respectively. These gains were primarily from the sale of fixed-rate residential loans. The Bank serviced loans owned by others totaling approximately 540.2 million and 385.8 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of the total loans serviced for others at December 31, 2022, 422.3 million related to commercial real estate, commercial business and construction loans, portions of which were sold to other parties. The remaining 117.9 million of loans serviced for others related to one- to four-family real estate loans which the Bank had originated and sold, but retained the obligation to service, or had acquired the servicing through various FDIC-assisted transactions. The servicing of these loans generated fees (net of amortization of the servicing rights) to the Bank for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, of 185,000, 237,000 and 637,000, respectively. In addition to interest earned on loans and loan origination fees, the Bank receives fees for loan commitments, letters of credit, prepayments, modifications, late payments, transfers of loans due to changes of property ownership and other miscellaneous services. The fees vary from time to time, generally depending on the supply of funds and other competitive conditions in the market. Fees from prepayments, commitments, letters of credit and late payments totaled 1.3 million, 1.6 million and 1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Loan origination fees, net of related costs, are accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 310-20, Receivables Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs . Loan fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred, and the net fee or cost is recognized in interest income using the level-yield method over the contractual life of the loan. For further discussion of this matter, see Note 1 of the accompanying audited financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Report. Loan Delinquencies and Defaults When a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan, the Bank attempts to cause the delinquency to be cured by contacting the borrower. In the case of loans secured by residential real estate, a late notice is sent 15 days after the due date. If the delinquency is not cured by the 30th day, a delinquent notice is sent to the borrower. Additional written contacts are made with the borrower 45 and 60 days after the due date. If the delinquency continues for a period of 120 days, the Bank usually institutes appropriate action to foreclose on the collateral. The actual time it takes to foreclose on the collateral varies depending on the particular circumstances and the applicable governing law. If foreclosed upon, the property is sold at public auction and may be purchased by the Bank. Delinquent consumer loans are handled in a generally similar manner, except that initial contacts are made when the payment is five days past due and appropriate action may be taken to collect any loan payment that is delinquent for more than 15 days. The Bank s procedures for repossession and sale of consumer collateral are subject to various requirements under the applicable consumer protection laws as well as other applicable laws and the determination by the Bank that it would be beneficial from a cost basis. Delinquent commercial business loans and loans secured by commercial real estate are initially handled by the loan officer in charge of the loan, who is responsible for contacting the borrower. Senior management also works with the commercial loan officers to see that necessary steps are taken to collect delinquent loans and may reassign the loan relationship to the special assets group. In addition, the Bank has a Problem Loan Committee which meets at least quarterly and reviews all classified assets, as well as other loans which

 management feels may present possible collection problems. If an acceptable workout of a delinquent commercial loan cannot be agreed upon, the Bank may initiate foreclosure proceedings on any collateral securing the loan. However, in all cases, whether a commercial or other loan, the prevailing circumstances may be such that management may determine it is in the best interest of the Bank not to foreclose on the collateral. In the table below for 2021, loans that were modified under the guidance provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act CARES Act are included in the Current Amount column as they were current under their modified terms. If any of these loans were further modified after December 31, 2021, they would no longer be under the guidance provided by the CARES Act.

The regulations require insured institutions to classify their own assets and to establish prudent specific allocations for losses from assets classified substandard or doubtful. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful, have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. For the portion of assets classified as loss, an institution is required to either establish specific allowances of 100 of the amount classified or charge such amount off its books. Assets that do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess a potential weakness (referred to as special mention assets), are required to be listed on the Bank s watch list and monitored for further deterioration or improvement. Following are the total classified assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, per the Bank s internal asset classification list. The allowances for credit losses reflected below are the portions of the Bank s total allowances for credit losses relating to these classified loans. There were no significant off-balance sheet items classified at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Loans generally are placed on non-accrual status when the loan becomes 90 days delinquent or when the collection of principal, interest, or both, otherwise becomes doubtful. Prior to the Company s adoption of the Current Expected Credit Loss CECL accounting standard on January 1, 2021, FDIC-assisted acquired non-performing assets, including foreclosed assets and potential problem loans, were not included in the totals or in the discussion of non-performing loans, potential problem loans and foreclosed assets. These assets were initially recorded at their estimated fair values as of their acquisition dates and accounted for in pools. The loan pools were analyzed rather than the individual loans. The performance of the loan pools acquired in each of the Company s five FDIC-assisted transactions has been better than expectations as of the acquisition dates. In the tables below, FDIC-assisted acquired assets are included in their particular collateral categories for the years ended after December 31, 2020.

The allowance for credit losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining an allowance level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is measured using an average historical loss model which incorporates relevant information about past events (including historical credit loss experience on loans with similar risk characteristics), current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the remaining cash flows over the contractual term of the loans. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective (pool) basis. Loans are aggregated into pools based on similar risk characteristics including borrower type, collateral and repayment types and expected credit loss patterns. Loans that may not share similar risk characteristics, primarily classified and/or TDR loans with a balance greater than or equal to 100,000 which are classified or restructured troubled debt, are evaluated on an individual basis. For loans evaluated for credit losses on a collective basis, average historical loss rates are calculated for each pool using the Company s historical net charge-offs (combined charge-offs and recoveries by observable historical reporting period) and outstanding loan balances during a lookback period. Lookback periods can be different based on the individual pool and represent management s credit expectations for the pool of loans over the remaining contractual life. In certain loan pools, if the Company s own historical loss rate is not reflective of the loss expectations, the historical loss rate is augmented by industry and peer data. The calculated average net charge-off rate is then adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. These adjustments increase or decrease the average historical loss rate to reflect expectations of future losses given economic forecasts of key macroeconomic variables including, but not limited to, unemployment rate, GDP, disposable income and market volatility. The adjustments are based on results from various regression models projecting the impact of the macroeconomic variables to loss rates. The forecast is used for 
 22 

Table of Contents 
 a reasonable and supportable period before reverting back to historical averages using a straight-line method. The forecast adjusted loss rate is applied to the amortized cost of loans over the remaining contractual lives, adjusted for expected prepayments. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications unless there is a reasonable expectation that a troubled debt restructuring will be executed. Additionally, the allowance for credit losses considers other qualitative factors not included in historical loss rates or macroeconomic forecast such as changes in portfolio composition, underwriting practices, or significant unique events or conditions. See Note 3 Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses of the accompanying audited financial statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Item 8 and Item 7 of this Report, respectively, for additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses. Inherent in this process is the evaluation of individual significant credit relationships. From time to time certain credit relationships may deteriorate due to payment performance, cash flow of the borrower, value of collateral, or other factors. In these instances, management may revise its loss estimates and assumptions for these specific credits due to changing circumstances. In some cases, additional losses may be realized; in other instances, the factors that led to the deterioration may improve or the credit may be refinanced elsewhere and allocated allowances may be released from the particular credit. Significant changes were made to management s overall methodology for evaluating the allowance for credit losses during the periods presented in the financial statements of this report due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13. On January 1, 2021, the Company adopted the new accounting standard related to the allowance for credit losses. For assets held at amortized cost basis, this standard eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP and, instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected credit losses. See Note 3 Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses of the accompanying financial statements for additional information. In addition, the Company considers that the determination of the valuations of foreclosed assets held for sale involves a high degree of judgment and complexity. The carrying value of foreclosed assets reflects management s best estimate of the amount to be realized from the sales of the assets. While the estimate is generally based on a valuation by an independent appraiser or recent sales of similar properties, the amount that the Company realizes from the sales of the assets could differ materially from the carrying value reflected in the financial statements, resulting in losses that could adversely impact earnings in future periods. At December 31, 2022, Great Southern had an allowance for credit losses of 63.5 million, of which 245,000 had been allocated to specific loans. At December 31, 2021, Great Southern had an allowance for losses on loans of 60.8 million, of which 495,000 had been allocated to specific loans. All loans with specific allowances were considered to be collateral-dependent loans. The allowance and the activity within the allowance during 2022, 2021 and 2020 are discussed further in Note 3 Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses of the accompanying audited financial statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Item 8 and Item 7 of this Report, respectively. The allocation of the allowance for losses on loans at the dates indicated is summarized as follows.

All of the mortgage-backed, collateralized mortgage, and SBA securities held by the Company are issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies. These securities are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, are highly rated by major rating agencies and have a long history of no credit losses. Likewise, the Company has not experienced historical losses on these types of securities. Accordingly, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded for these securities. Regarding securities issued by state and political subdivisions, management considers the following when evaluating these securities: (i) current issuer bond ratings, (ii) historical loss rates for given bond ratings, (iii) whether issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities, (iv) updated financial information of the issuer, (v) internal forecasts and (vi) whether such securities provide insurance or other credit enhancement or are pre-refunded by the issuers. These securities are highly rated by major rating agencies and have a long history of no credit losses. Likewise, the Company has not experienced historical losses on these types of securities. Accordingly, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded for these securities. Sources of Funds General . Deposit accounts have traditionally been the principal source of the Bank s funds for use in lending and for other general business purposes. In addition to deposits, the Bank obtains funds through advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines FHLBank and other borrowings, loan repayments, loan sales, and cash flows generated from operations. Scheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and the related costs of such funds have varied widely. Borrowings such as FHLBank advances may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for seasonal reductions in deposits or deposit inflows at less than projected levels and may be used on a longer-term basis to support expanded lending activities. The availability of funds from loan sales is influenced generally by the level of interest rates, which in turn may impact the volume of originations. Deposits . The Bank attracts both short-term and long-term deposits from the general public by offering a wide variety of accounts and rates and also purchases brokered deposits from time to time. The Bank offers regular savings accounts, checking accounts, various money market accounts, fixed-interest rate certificates with varying maturities, certificates of deposit in minimum amounts of 250,000 Jumbo accounts), brokered certificates and individual retirement accounts. In 2020, the Bank increased its interest-bearing demand and savings deposits and non-interest-bearing demand deposits through internal growth. Both commercial and retail customer balances increased as the COVID-19 pandemic continued throughout 2020. During 2020, the Bank decreased its total time deposits by approximately 330 million. Time deposits originated through the Bank s internet channel increased by 65 million and brokered deposits, including IntraFi purchased funds, decreased 213 million. In 2021, the Bank increased its interest-bearing demand and savings deposits and non-interest-bearing demand deposits through internal growth. Both commercial and retail customer balances increased as the COVID-19 pandemic continued throughout 2021. Non-interest-bearing demand deposits increased 225 million in 2021, while interest-bearing demand and savings deposits increased 240 million. During 2021, the Bank also decreased its total time deposits by approximately 430 million. Time deposits originated through the Bank s internet channel decreased by 200 million and brokered deposits, including IntraFi purchased funds, decreased 91 million. The brokered deposits and deposits originated through the Bank s internet channel were allowed to mature without replacement as other deposit categories increased in 2020 and 2021. In the latter half of 2022, some of the interest-bearing demand and savings deposits and non-interest-bearing demand deposits decreased as some of the COVID-19 pandemic surge deposits flowed out of both retail and business customer accounts. Total balances in these 
 29 

Table of Contents 
 categories did not return to pre-pandemic levels, but they declined from peak balance levels in 2021 and early 2022. Non-interest-bearing demand deposits decreased 146 million in 2022 and interest-bearing demand and savings deposits, excluding brokered deposits, decreased 193 million. During 2022, in response to customer demand in a rising interest rate environment, the Bank increased its total time deposits by approximately 322 million. Time deposits originated through the Bank s internet channel decreased by 152 million and brokered time deposits, including IntraFi purchased funds, increased 194 million. The Bank s retail time deposits originated through its banking center and corporate services network increased 280 million. The following table sets forth the dollar amount of deposits, by interest rate range, in the various types of deposit programs offered by the Bank at the dates indicated.

The variety of deposit accounts offered by the Bank has allowed it to be competitive in obtaining funds and respond with flexibility to changes in consumer demand. The Bank has become more susceptible to short-term fluctuations in deposit flows, as customers have become more interest rate conscious and the Bank s deposit mix has changed to a smaller percentage of time deposits. The Bank manages the pricing of its deposits in keeping with its asset/liability management and profitability objectives. Based on its experience, management believes that its certificate accounts are relatively stable sources of deposits, while its checking accounts have proven to be more volatile. The ability of the Bank to attract and maintain deposits, and the rates paid on these deposits, has been and will continue to be significantly affected by money market conditions.

Maturities as of December 31, 2021 3 Months Over 3 to 6 Over 6 to 12 Over Or Less Months Months 12 Months Total (In Thousands) Uninsured Time Deposits 18,421 24,730 49,021 16,559 108,431 In addition to the uninsured time deposits noted above, the uninsured deposits with no maturity date are 738.6 million and 872.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, for total uninsured deposits at those dates of 938.8 million and 981.0 million, respectively. Brokered deposits . Brokered deposits are marketed through national brokerage firms to their customers in 1,000 increments. The Bank maintains only one account for the total deposit amount while the detailed records of owners are maintained by the Depository Trust Company under the name of CEDE Co. The deposits are transferable just like a stock or bond investment and the customer can open the account with a phone call or an online request. This provides a large deposit for the Bank at a lower operating cost since the Bank only has one account to maintain versus several accounts with multiple interest and maturity dates. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank had approximately 411.5 million and 67.4 million in brokered deposits, respectively. Included in the brokered deposits total at December 31, 2022 was 150.0 million in IntraFi Funding accounts. IntraFi Funding transactions represent a cost-effective source of funding without collateralization or credit limits for the Company. These transactions help the Company obtain large blocks of funding while providing control over pricing and diversity of wholesale funding options. At December 31, 2022, all of these IntraFi deposits were at floating rates indexed to the effective fed funds rate. These deposits are included in interest-bearing checking and savings accounts. There were no IntraFi Funding transactions included in the brokered deposits total at December 31, 2021. Previously included in brokered deposits were IntraFi Network Deposit accounts. In 2018, the FDIC amended its regulations to exclude these deposits from its definition of brokered deposits. IntraFi Network Deposit accounts are accounts that are just like any other deposit account on the Company s books, except that the account total exceeds the FDIC deposit insurance maximum. When a customer places a large deposit with an IntraFi Network bank, that bank uses IntraFi to place the funds into deposit accounts issued by 
 31 

Table of Contents 
 other banks in the IntraFi Network. This occurs in increments of less than the standard FDIC insurance maximum, so that both principal and interest are eligible for complete FDIC protection. Other Network members do the same thing with their customers funds. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank had approximately 12.4 million and 41.7 million in IntraFi Network Deposits, respectively. Unlike non-brokered certificates of deposit, which can be withdrawn (with a penalty) prior to maturity for any reason, including increasing interest rates, a brokered deposit (excluding IntraFi Network Deposits) can only be withdrawn prior to maturity in the event of the death, or court declared mental incompetence, of the depositor. This allows the Bank to better manage the maturity of its deposits. Additionally, the Bank may issue brokered deposits which are callable at the Bank s discretion prior to their stated maturity date. Currently, the rates offered by the Bank for brokered deposits are similar to those offered for retail certificates of deposit of similar size and maturity. The Bank maintained increased liquidity during and after the economic recession that began in 2008. After 2009, we had gradually reduced the amount of brokered deposits (excluding IntraFi Network Deposits) utilized as we added deposits from FDIC-assisted acquisitions. As loan demand began to increase starting in 2013, we gradually increased our usage of brokered deposits again from time to time. During 2021, we decreased our usage of brokered deposits as we experienced growth in a variety of non-time deposits in 2020 and 2021. During 2022, as loan demand trended upward, we again utilized brokered deposits to obtain additional funding. The Company may use interest rate swaps from time to time to manage its interest rate risks from recorded financial liabilities. In the past, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements with the objective of economically hedging against the effects of changes in the fair value of its liabilities for fixed rate brokered certificates of deposit caused by changes in market interest rates. These interest rate swaps have allowed the Company to create funding of varying maturities at a variable rate that in the past has approximated three-month LIBOR. The Company did not utilize these types of interest rate swaps on brokered deposits in 2022, 2021, or 2020. Borrowings . Great Southern s other sources of funds include advances from the FHLBank, a Qualified Loan Review QLR arrangement with the FRB, customer repurchase agreements and other borrowings. As a member of the FHLBank, the Bank is required to own capital stock in the FHLBank and is authorized to apply for advances from the FHLBank. Each FHLBank credit program has its own interest rate, which may be fixed or variable, and range of maturities. The FHLBank may prescribe the acceptable uses for these advances, as well as other risks on availability, limitations on the size of the advances and repayment provisions. At both December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank had no FHLBank term advances outstanding. The Bank had outstanding overnight borrowings of 88.5 million from the FHLBank at December 31, 2022 and no overnight borrowings from FHLB at December 31, 2021. Because they are overnight borrowings, any outstanding balances are included in short-term borrowings in the Company s financial statements. The Bank has in the past utilized, and may again utilize, FHLBank advances from time to time to fund loan growth. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis FRBSL has a QLR program where the Bank can borrow on a temporary basis using commercial loans pledged to the FRBSL. Under the QLR program, the Bank can borrow any amount up to a calculated collateral value of the commercial loans pledged, for virtually any reason that creates a temporary cash need. Examples of this could be: (1) the need to fund for late outgoing wires or cash letter settlements, (2) the need to disburse one or several loans but the permanent source of funds will not be available for a few days; (3) a temporary spike in interest rates on other funding sources that are being used; or (4) the need to purchase a security for collateral pledging purposes a few days prior to the funds becoming available on an existing security that is maturing. The Bank had commercial, consumer and other loans pledged to the FRBSL at December 31, 2022 that would have allowed approximately 397.0 million to be borrowed under the above arrangement. There were no outstanding borrowings from the FRBSL at December 31, 2022 or 2021 and the facility was not used during 2022 or 2021. The Bank enters into sales of securities under agreements to repurchase (reverse repurchase agreements). Reverse repurchase agreements are treated as financings, and the obligations to repurchase securities sold are reflected as a liability in the statements of financial condition. The dollar amount of securities underlying the agreements remains in the asset accounts. Securities underlying the agreements are held by the Bank during the agreement period. The agreements generally are written on a term of one-month or less. In November 2006, Great Southern Capital Trust II Trust II ), a statutory trust formed by the Company for the purpose of issuing the securities, issued 25.0 million aggregate liquidation amount of floating rate cumulative trust preferred securities. The Trust II securities bear a floating distribution rate equal to 90-day LIBOR plus 1.60 . The Trust II securities became redeemable at the

 Company s option in February 2012, and if not sooner redeemed, mature on February 1, 2037. The Trust II securities were sold in a private transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The gross proceeds of the offering were used to purchase Junior Subordinated Debentures from the Company totaling 25.8 million and bearing an interest rate identical to the distribution rate on the Trust II securities. The initial interest rate on the Trust II debentures was 6.98 . The interest rate was 6.04 and 1.73 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. On August 8, 2016, the Company completed the public offering and sale of 75.0 million of its subordinated notes. The notes were due August 15, 2026, and had a fixed interest rate of 5.25 until August 15, 2021, at which time the rate was to become floating at a rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 4.087 . The notes were sold at par, resulting in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions, legal, accounting and other professional fees, of approximately 73.5 million. Total debt issuance costs of approximately 1.5 million were deferred and amortized over the five-year expected life of the notes. On August 15, 2021, in accordance with the terms of the notes, the Company redeemed all 75.0 million aggregate principal amount of the notes at a redemption price equal to 100 of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. On June 10, 2020, the Company completed the public offering and sale of 75.0 million of its subordinated notes. The notes are due June 15, 2030, and have a fixed interest rate of 5.50 until June 15, 2025, at which time the rate becomes floating at a rate expected to be equal to three-month term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 5.325 . The Company may call the notes at par beginning on June 15, 2025, and on any scheduled interest payment date thereafter. The notes were sold at par, resulting in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions, legal, accounting and other professional fees, of approximately 73.5 million. Total debt issuance costs of approximately 1.5 million were deferred and are being amortized over the expected life of the notes, which is five years. Amortization of the debt issuance costs during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, totaled 293,000, 587,000 and 608,000, respectively, and is included in interest expense on subordinated notes in the consolidated statements of income, resulting in an imputed interest rate of 5.95 at December 31, 2022.

In addition to competing with other commercial and savings banks, the Company competes with credit unions, finance companies, leasing companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms, financial technology fintech companies, and many other financial service firms. Competition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer service, quality and range of products and services offered, price, reputation, interest rates on loans and deposits, lending limits and customer convenience. Our ability to continue to compete effectively also depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees, while managing compensation and other costs. A substantial number of the commercial banks operating in most of the Company s market areas are branches or subsidiaries of large organizations affiliated with statewide, regional or national banking companies and as a result they may have greater resources with which to compete. Additionally, the Company faces competition from a large number of community banks, many of which have senior management who were previously with other local banks or investor groups with strong local business and community ties. The Company encounters strong competition in attracting deposits throughout its six-state retail footprint. The Company attracts a significant amount of deposits through its branch offices primarily from the communities in which those branch offices are located. Of our total 92 branch offices at the end of 2022, approximately 72.1 of our deposit franchise dollars were located in Missouri, where our total market share at June 30, 2022, was 1.4 , or twelfth in the state (based on FDIC market share deposits). The financial institutions with the top three market share positions in Missouri at June 30, 2022, were Bank of America, UMB Bank, and U.S. Bank, which had a combined market share of 28.5 . We also have branch offices in the states of Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Arkansas and Nebraska, which made up approximately 16.3 , 6.4 , 4.0 , 0.8 , and 0.5 of our total deposit franchise dollars, respectively (based on our total deposits as of December 31, 2022). The Company s market share in its primary metropolitan statistical areas was as follows at June 30, 2022: 

Number of Percentage of Total Metropolitan Statistical Area Branch Offices Market Share Rank Institution with Leading Market Share Position Springfield, MO 19 12.0 1 Great Southern Bank Sioux City, IA-NE-SD 6 6.8 4 Security National Bank of Sioux City Davenport/Moline/Rock Island, IA-IL 3 1.2 21 Quad City Bank and Trust Co. Des Moines/West Des Moines, IA 5 0.7 22 Principal Bank St. Louis, MO-IL 17 0.5 30 Stifel Bank and Trust Kansas City, MO-KS 8 0.3 38 UMB Bank Fayetteville/Springdale/Rogers, AR-MO 1 0.1 32 Arvest Bank Minneapolis/St. Paul/Bloomington, MN-WI 4 0.1 70 US Bank NA Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from other commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions located in our market areas. The Bank competes for these deposits by offering a variety of deposit accounts at competitive rates, convenient business hours, and accessible branch, online, mobile and ATM services. In addition, some competitors located outside of our market areas conduct business primarily over the Internet, which may enable them to realize certain savings and offer certain deposit products and services at lower costs or at higher rates and with greater convenience to certain customers. Our ability to attract and retain customer deposits depends on our ability to generally provide a rate of return, liquidity and risk comparable to that offered by competing investment opportunities. Competition in originating real estate loans comes primarily from other commercial banks, savings institutions and mortgage bankers making loans secured by real estate located in the Bank s market area. The specific institutions are similar to those discussed above in regards to deposit market share. Commercial banks and finance companies provide vigorous competition in commercial and consumer

 lending. The Bank competes for real estate and other loans principally on the basis of the interest rates and loan fees it charges, the types of loans it originates, the quality of services it provides to borrowers and the locations of our branch office network and loan production offices. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources, name recognition and market presence, which benefit them in attracting business. In addition, larger competitors (including nationwide banks that have a significant presence in our market areas) may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do because of their greater economies of scale. Smaller and newer competitors may also be more aggressive than we are in terms of pricing loan and deposit products in order to obtain a larger share of the market. In addition, some competitors located outside of our market areas conduct business primarily over the Internet, which may enable them to realize certain savings and offer products and services at more favorable rates and with greater convenience to certain customers. We also depend, from time to time, on outside funding sources, including brokered deposits, where we experience nationwide competition, and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Some of the financial institutions and financial services organizations with which we compete are not subject to the same degree of regulation as is imposed on insured depositary institutions and their holding companies. As a result, these non-bank competitors have certain advantages over us in accessing funding and in providing various services. Since mid-2022, the Company has increased the interest rates it pays on many deposit products. The Company has also utilized both fixed-rate and floating-rate brokered deposits of varying terms, as well as overnight FHLBank borrowings. Despite the highly competitive environment and the challenges it presents to us, management believes the Company will continue to be competitive because of its strong commitment to quality customer service, competitive products and pricing, convenient local branches, online and mobile capabilities, and active community involvement. Employees and Human Capital Resources At December 31, 2022, the Company and its affiliates had a total of 1,124 employees, including 210 part-time employees. None of the Company s employees are represented by any collective bargaining agreement. Management considers its employee relations to be good. Our human capital objectives include attracting, training, motivating, rewarding and retaining our employees. We encourage and support the growth and development of our employees and, wherever possible, seek to fill positions by promotion and transfer from within the organization. Continual learning and career development are advanced through annual performance and development conversations with employees, internally developed training programs, customized corporate training engagements and seminars, conferences, and other training events employees are encouraged to attend in connection with their job duties. Great Southern remains committed and focused on the health and safety of our associates, customers, and communities, especially as the COVID-19 virus remains a threat. Company management continues to monitor information related to the COVID-19 and other impactful viruses, using federal and state guidelines for public safety to manage the threat. The Company also remains focused on the overall wellbeing of its associates and their family members with a comprehensive no cost benefit offered through the Company s employee assistance program. Great Southern associates actively share their talents in their communities through leadership roles and volunteer activities in education, economic development, human and health services, and community reinvestment. Our Community Matters program allows each associate to be paid up to 32 hours per year, with supervisory approval, to volunteer for activities in their community during normal work hours. During 2022 Great Southern associates found creative and meaningful ways to give back to their communities. Great Southern associates donated nearly 4,000 hours in support of more than 200 organizations. Each year, the Bill and Ann Turner Distinguished Community Service Award is presented to a Great Southern associate who demonstrates excellence in volunteer service to their community. Every year, all associates are encouraged to nominate coworkers for this award. An external panel of community leaders reviews the nominees and determines the award winner. In addition, to volunteerism, Great Southern associates generously supported their communities in 2022 through monetary donations, totaling nearly 70,000.

 Government Supervision and Regulation General The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to supervision and examination by applicable federal and state banking agencies. The earnings of the Company s subsidiaries, and therefore the earnings of the Company, are affected by general economic conditions, management policies, federal and state legislation, and actions of various regulatory authorities, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, often referred to as the Federal Reserve Board (the FRB ), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC and the Missouri Division of Finance (the MDF ). The following is a brief summary of certain aspects of the regulation of the Company and the Bank and does not purport to fully discuss such regulation. Such regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the DIF, and not for the protection of stockholders. Significant Legislation Impacting the Financial Services Industry Dodd-Frank Act. In 2010, sweeping financial regulatory reform legislation entitled the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act implemented far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape. Certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act have been affected by the more recently enacted Economic Growth Act, as defined and discussed below under -Economic Growth Act. Capital Rules. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulatory capital rules that substantially amend the risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank and the Company. The rules implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Basel III refers to various documents released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. For the Company and the Bank, the general effective date of the rules was January 1, 2015, and, for certain provisions, various phase-in periods and later effective dates apply. The chief features of these rules are summarized below. Economic Growth Act. In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the Economic Growth Act ), was enacted to modify or eliminate certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While the Economic Growth Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than 10 billion and for large banks with assets of more than 50 billion. Many of these amendments could result in meaningful regulatory changes. The Economic Growth Act, among other matters, expands the definition of qualified mortgages which may be held by a financial institution and simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than 10 billion by instructing the federal banking regulators to establish a single Community Bank Leverage Ratio CBLR of between 8 and 10 percent. Any qualifying depository institution or its holding company that exceeds the CBLR will be considered to have met generally applicable leverage and risk-based regulatory capital requirements and any qualifying depository institution that exceeds the new ratio will be considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action rules. Currently, the CBLR is 9.0 . The Company and the Bank have chosen to not utilize the new CBLR due to the Company s size and complexity, including its commercial real estate and construction lending concentrations and significant off-balance sheet funding commitments. In addition, the Economic Growth Act includes regulatory relief in the areas of examination cycles, call reports, mortgage disclosures and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans. Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Legislation. A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the USA Patriot Act substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The United States Treasury Department has issued, and in some cases proposed, a number of regulations that apply various requirements of the USA Patriot Act to financial institutions. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. The regulations also impose specific due diligence requirements on financial institutions that maintain correspondent or private banking relationships with non-U.S. financial institutions or persons. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of

 the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious financial, legal and reputational consequences for the institution and could block or substantially delay a merger or other acquisition transaction. The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 AMLA ), which amends the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 BSA ), was enacted in January 2021. The AMLA is intended to be a comprehensive reform and modernization to U.S. bank secrecy and anti-money laundering laws. Among other things, it codifies a risk-based approach to anti-money laundering compliance for financial institutions; requires the U.S. Department of the Treasury to promulgate priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy; requires the development of standards for evaluating technology and internal processes for BSA compliance; expands enforcement- and investigation-related authority, including increasing available sanctions for certain BSA violations and expands BSA whistleblower incentives and protections. Many of the statutory provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemakings, reports and other measures, and the impact of the AMLA will depend on, among other things, rulemaking and implementation guidance. In June 2021, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, issued the priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy required under the AMLA. The priorities include corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and proliferation financing. Bank Holding Company Regulation The Company is a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company by the FRB. Financial holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FRB under the Bank Holding Company Act and the regulations of the FRB. The Company is required to file reports with the FRB and such additional information as the FRB may require, and is subject to regular examinations by the FRB. The FRB also has extensive enforcement authority over financial holding companies, including, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to require that a holding company divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries). In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Under FRB policy and the Dodd-Frank Act, a bank holding company must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks. Accordingly, the FRB may require, and has required in the past, that a bank holding company contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, a financial holding company must obtain FRB approval before: (i) acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company that is not a subsidiary if, after such acquisition, it would own or control more than 5 of such shares; (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank or financial holding company; or (iii) merging or consolidating with another bank or financial holding company. The Bank Holding Company Act also prohibits a financial holding company generally from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those involving banking, activities closely related to banking that are permitted for a bank holding company, and certain securities, insurance and merchant banking activities. Certain investments greater than 5 in companies engaged in activities not permitted for a bank holding company are prohibited. Volcker Rule The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations to implement the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act known as the Volcker Rule. Under the regulations, FDIC-insured depository institutions, their holding companies, subsidiaries and affiliates are generally prohibited, subject to certain exemptions, from proprietary trading of securities and other financial instruments and from acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in a covered fund. Effective July 22, 2019, a bank and its holding company are exempt from the Volcker Rule if the bank and every company that controls it have consolidated assets of 10 billion or less and have total consolidated trading assets and liabilities of 5 or less of its consolidated assets. Interstate Banking and Branching Federal law allows the FRB to approve an application of a bank holding company to acquire control of, or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, a bank located in a state other than such holding company s home state, without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state. The FRB may not approve the acquisition of a bank that has not been in existence for the minimum time period (not exceeding five years) specified by the statutory law of the host state. Federal law also prohibits the FRB 
 40 

Table of Contents 
 from approving such an application if the applicant (and its depository institution affiliates) controls or would control more than 10 of the insured deposits in the United States or if the applicant would control 30 or more of the deposits in any state in which the target bank maintains a branch and in which the applicant or any of its depository institution affiliates controls a depository institution or branch immediately prior to the acquisition of the target bank. Federal law does not affect the authority of states to limit the percentage of total insured deposits in the state which may be held or controlled by a bank or bank holding company to the extent such limitation does not discriminate against out-of-state banks or bank holding companies. Individual states may also waive the 30 state-wide concentration limit. Missouri law prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring a depository institution if total deposits would exceed 13 of statewide deposits excluding bank certificates of deposit of 100,000 or more, deposits from sources outside the United States and deposits of banks other than banks controlled by the bank holding company. The federal banking agencies are generally authorized to approve interstate bank merger transactions and de novo branching without regard to whether such transactions are prohibited by the law of any state. Interstate acquisitions of branches are generally permitted only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits such acquisitions. As required by federal law, federal regulations prohibit any out-of-state bank from using the interstate branching authority primarily for the purpose of deposit production, including guidelines to ensure that interstate branches operated by an out-of-state bank in a host state reasonably help to meet the credit needs of the communities they serve. Certain Transactions with Affiliates and Other Persons Transactions involving the Bank and its affiliates are subject to sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, and regulations thereunder, which impose certain quantitative limits and collateral requirements on such transactions, and require all such transactions to be on terms at least as favorable to the Bank as are available in transactions with non-affiliates. All loans by the Bank to the principal stockholders, directors and executive officers of the Bank or any affiliate are subject to regulations restricting loans and other transactions with insiders of the Bank and its affiliates. Transactions involving such persons must be on terms and conditions as favorable to the bank as those that apply in similar transactions with non-insiders. A bank may allow favorable rate loans to insiders pursuant to an employee benefit program available to bank employees generally. The Bank has such a program. Dividends The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the FRB s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that its net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding company s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The FRB also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Furthermore, a bank holding company may be prohibited from paying any dividends if the holding company s bank subsidiary is not adequately capitalized, and dividends payable by a bank holding company and its depository institutions subsidiaries can be restricted if the capital conservation buffer requirement is not met. See Capital below. A bank holding company is required to give the FRB prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10 or more of the company s consolidated net worth. The FRB may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, FRB order, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the FRB. This notification requirement does not apply to any company that meets the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies, is well-managed, and is not subject to any unresolved supervisory issues. Under Missouri law, the Bank may pay dividends from certain undivided profits and may not pay dividends if its capital is impaired. Dividends of the Company and the Bank may also be restricted under the capital conservation buffer rules, as discussed below under Capital. Capital The Company and the Bank are subject to capital regulations adopted by the FRB and the FDIC, which established minimum required ratios for common equity Tier 1 CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital and the minimum leverage ratio; set forth the risk- 
 41 

Table of Contents 
 weightings of assets and certain off-balance sheet items for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios; require an additional capital conservation buffer over the required risk-based capital ratios, and define what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting the capital requirements. Under the capital regulations, the minimum capital ratios are: (1) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5 of risk-weighted assets; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0 of risk-weighted assets; (3) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 of risk-weighted assets; and (4) a leverage ratio (the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total adjusted assets) of 4.0 . CET1 generally consists of common stock; retained earnings; accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI unless an institution has elected to exclude AOCI from regulatory capital; and certain minority interests; all subject to applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. Tier 1 capital generally consists of CET1 and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital generally consists of other preferred stock and subordinated debt meeting certain conditions plus an amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses up to 1.25 of assets. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. Mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets over designated percentages of CET1 are deducted from capital. In addition, Tier 1 capital includes AOCI, which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt and equity securities . However, because of our asset size, we were eligible to elect to permanently opt out of the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt and equity securities in our capital calculations. We elected this option. For purposes of determining risk-based capital, assets and certain off-balance sheet items are risk-weighted from 0 to 1,250 , depending on the risk characteristics of the asset or item. The risk weights include, for example, a 150 risk weight for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and for non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise in nonaccrual status; a 20 credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable; and a 250 risk weight for mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital. In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and total capital ratios, the Company and the Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5 of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, repurchasing shares, and paying discretionary bonuses. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard for US GAAP that became effective for us on January 1, 2021. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, requires FDIC-insured institutions and their holding companies (banking organizations) to recognize credit losses expected over the life of certain financial assets. CECL covers a broader range of assets than the prior method of recognizing credit losses and generally results in earlier recognition of credit losses. Upon adoption of CECL, a one-time adjustment was recorded to the credit loss allowances as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of credit loss allowances under the current methodology and the amount required under CECL. Implementation of CECL reduced retained earnings, and affected other items, in a manner that reduced regulatory capital. The federal banking regulators (the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC) adopted a rule that gives a banking organization the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects of CECL on its regulatory capital. We elected this option. Under the FDIC s prompt corrective action standards, in order to be considered well-capitalized, the Bank must have a ratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.5 , a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 8 , a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 10 , and a leverage ratio of 5 ; and must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. In order to be considered adequately capitalized, an institution must have the minimum capital ratios described above. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank was well-capitalized. An institution that is not well-capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits and interest rates on deposits. The federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action if an institution fails to satisfy the requirements to qualify as adequately capitalized. All institutions, regardless of their capital levels, are restricted from making any capital distribution or paying any management fees that would cause the institution to fail to satisfy the requirements to qualify as adequately capitalized. An institution that is not at least adequately capitalized is: (i) subject to increased monitoring by the appropriate federal banking regulator; (ii) required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan (including certain guarantees by any company controlling the institution) within 45 days; (iii) subject to asset growth limits; and (iv) required to obtain prior regulatory approval for acquisitions, branching and

 new lines of business. Additional restrictions and appointment of a receiver or conservator, can apply, depending on the institution s capital level. The FDIC has jurisdiction over the Bank for purposes of prompt corrective action. When the FDIC as receiver liquidates an institution, the claims of depositors and the FDIC as their successor (for deposits covered by FDIC insurance) have priority over other unsecured claims against the institution, including claims of stockholders. To be considered well-capitalized, a bank holding company must have, on a consolidated basis, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 or greater and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 or greater and must not be subject to an individual order, directive or agreement under which the FRB requires it to maintain a specific capital level. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was well-capitalized. The federal banking agencies consider concentrations of credit risk and risks from non-traditional activities, as well as an institution s ability to manage those risks, when determining the adequacy of an institution s capital. This evaluation is generally made as part of the institution s regular safety and soundness examination. Under their regulations, the federal banking agencies also consider interest rate risk (when the interest rate sensitivity of an institution s assets does not match the sensitivity of its liabilities or its off-balance-sheet position) in the evaluation of a bank s capital adequacy. The banking agencies have issued guidance on evaluating interest rate risk. Although we continue to evaluate the impact that the capital rules have on the Company and the Bank, we anticipate that the Company and the Bank will remain well-capitalized, and will continue to meet the capital conservation buffer requirement. Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC Great Southern is a member of the DIF, which is administered by the FDIC. Deposits are insured up to the applicable limits by the FDIC, backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government. The general deposit insurance limit is 250,000 per deposit relationship. The FDIC assesses deposit insurance premiums on all FDIC-insured institutions quarterly based on annualized rates. These premiums are assessed on an institution s total assets minus its tangible equity. Under these rules, assessment rates for an institution with total assets of less than 10 billion are determined by weighted average CAMELS composite ratings and certain financial ratios, and range from 3.0 to 30.0 basis points, subject to certain adjustments. In an emergency, the FDIC may also impose a special assessment. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes 1.35 as the minimum reserve ratio. The FDIC adopted a plan to meet this ratio, which was achieved on September 30, 2018, ahead of the September 30, 2020 statutory deadline. In addition to the statutory minimum ratio, the FDIC has the authority to establish a reserve ratio known as the designated reserve ratio or DRR, which may exceed the statutory minimum. The FDIC has established 2.0 as the DRR. Extraordinary growth in insured deposits during the first and second quarters of 2020 caused the reserve ratio to decline below the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent as of June 30, 2020. In September 2020, the FDIC Board of Directors adopted a Restoration Plan to restore the reserve ratio to at least 1.35 percent within eight years, absent extraordinary circumstances, as required by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The Restoration Plan maintained the assessment rate schedules in place at the time and required the FDIC to update its analysis and projections for the DIF balance and reserve ratio at least semiannually. In the semiannual update for the Restoration Plan in June 2022, the FDIC projected that the reserve ratio was at risk of not reaching the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent by September 30, 2028, the statutory deadline to restore the reserve ratio. Based on this update, the FDIC Board approved an Amended Restoration Plan, and concurrently proposed an increase in initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by 2 basis points, applicable to all insured depository institutions. In October 2022, the FDIC Board finalized the increase with an effective date of January 1, 2023, applicable to the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The revised assessment rate schedules are intended to increase the likelihood that the reserve ratio of the DIF reaches the statutory minimum level of 1.35 percent by September 30, 2028. The FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions, and is the primary federal banking regulator of state banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve, such as the Bank. The FDIC examines the Bank regularly. The FDIC may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the DIF. The FDIC also has the authority to take enforcement actions against banks and savings associations.

 Federal Reserve System Banks are authorized to borrow from the FRB discount window, but FRB regulations only allow this borrowing for short periods of time and generally require banks to exhaust other reasonable alternative sources of funds where practical, including FHLBank advances, before borrowing from the FRB. See Sources of Funds Borrowings above. Federal Home Loan Bank System The Bank is a member of the FHLBank of Des Moines, which is one of 11 regional FHLBanks. As a member, Great Southern is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLBank of Des Moines in an amount equal to the greater of 1 of its outstanding home loans or 5 of its outstanding FHLBank advances. At December 31, 2022, Great Southern had 10.1 million in FHLBank of Des Moines stock, which was in compliance with this requirement. In past years, the Bank has received dividends on its FHLBank stock. Over the past five years, such dividends have averaged 5.79 and were 6.56 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Legislative and Regulatory Proposals Any changes in the extensive regulatory scheme to which the Company or the Bank is and will be subject, whether by any of the federal banking agencies or Congress, or the Missouri legislature or MDF, could have a material effect on the Company or the Bank, and the Company and the Bank cannot predict what, if any, future actions may be taken by legislative or regulatory authorities or what impact such actions may have. Federal and State Taxation General The following discussion contains a summary of certain federal and state income tax provisions applicable to the Company and the Bank. It is not a comprehensive description of the federal or state income tax laws that may affect the Company and the Bank. The following discussion is based upon current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code and Treasury and judicial interpretations thereof. The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return using the accrual method of accounting, with the exception of GSB Two which files a separate return as a REIT. All corporations joining in the consolidated federal income tax return are jointly and severally liable for taxes due and payable by the consolidated group. The following discussion primarily focuses upon the taxation of the Bank, since the federal income tax law contains certain special provisions with respect to banks. Financial institutions, such as the Bank, are subject, with certain exceptions, to the provisions of the Code generally applicable to corporations. Bad Debt Deduction As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, retained earnings included approximately 17.5 million for which no deferred income tax liability had been recognized. This amount represents an allocation of income to bad debt deductions for tax purposes only for tax years prior to 1988. If the Bank were to liquidate, the entire amount would have to be recaptured and would create income for tax purposes only, which would be subject to the then-current corporate income tax rate. The unrecorded deferred income tax liability on the above amount was approximately 4.3 million and 3.9 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Bank is required to follow the specific charge-off method which only allows a bad debt deduction equal to actual charge-offs, net of recoveries, experienced during the fiscal year of the deduction. In a year where recoveries exceed charge-offs, the Bank would be required to include the net recoveries in taxable income.

Table of Contents 
 Interest Deduction In the case of a financial institution, such as the Bank, no deduction is allowed for the pro rata portion of its interest expense which is allocable to tax-exempt interest on obligations acquired after August 7, 1986. A limited class of tax-exempt obligations acquired after August 7, 1986 will not be subject to this complete disallowance rule. For certain tax-exempt obligations issued in 2009 and 2010, an amount of tax-exempt obligations that are not generally considered part of the limited class of tax-exempt obligations noted above may be treated as part of the limited class of tax-exempt obligations to the extent of two percent of a financial institution s total assets. For tax-exempt obligations acquired after December 31, 1982 and before August 8, 1986 and for obligations acquired after August 7, 1986 that are not subject to the complete disallowance rule, 80 of interest incurred to purchase or carry such obligations will be deductible. No portion of the interest expense allocable to tax-exempt obligations acquired by a financial institution before January 1, 1983, which is otherwise deductible, will be disallowed. The interest expense disallowance rules cited above have not significantly impacted the Bank. State Taxation Missouri-based banks, such as the Bank, are subject to a franchise tax which is imposed on the bank s taxable income at the rate of 4.48 of the taxable income (determined without regard for any net operating losses) - income-based calculation. Prior to 2020, this rate was 7.00 . Missouri-based banks are entitled to a credit against the income-based franchise tax for all other state or local taxes on banks, except taxes on real estate, unemployment taxes, bank tax, and taxes on tangible personal property owned by the Bank and held for lease or rental to others. The Company and all subsidiaries are subject to a Missouri income tax that is imposed on the corporation s taxable income at the rate of 4.00 . The return is filed on a consolidated basis by all members of the consolidated group, including the Bank but excluding GSB Two. As a REIT, GSB Two files a separate Missouri income tax return. Prior to 2020, the Missouri corporate income tax rate was 6.25 . The Bank also has full-service offices in Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska and Arkansas, and has commercial loan production offices in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Texas. As a result, the Bank is subject to franchise and income taxes that are imposed on the corporation s taxable income attributable to those states. As a Maryland corporation, the Company is required to file an annual report with and pay an annual fee to the State of Maryland. Examinations The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have not been audited recently by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). As a result, federal tax years through December 31, 2018, are now closed. The Company was previously under State of Missouri income and franchise tax examinations for its 2014 and 2015 tax years. The examinations concluded with one unresolved issue related to the exclusion of certain income in the calculation of Missouri income tax. The Missouri Department of Revenue denied the Company s administrative protest regarding the 2014 and 2015 tax years examinations. In June 2021, the Company filed a formal protest with the Missouri Administrative Hearing Commission (MAHC), which has special jurisdiction to hear tax matters and is similar to a trial court, to continue defending the Company s rights and associated tax position. The Company has engaged legal and tax advisors and continues to believe it will ultimately prevail on the issue; however, if the Company does not prevail, the tax obligation to the State of Missouri could be up to a total of 4.0 million for these tax years and additional amounts could be levied for subsequent tax years. The MAHC received documents from each party but no hearings have occurred to date. The State of Illinois Department of Revenue recently completed a tax examination of the Company s Illinois Business Income Tax for the 2018 and 2019 tax years. There were no proposed material changes to the returns.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS An investment in the common stock of the Company is speculative in nature and is subject to certain risks inherent in the business of the Company and the Bank. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Company and the Bank are described below. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment in the Company s common stock. The risks described below are not the only ones we face in our business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed. In such an event, our common stock could decline in value. References to we, us, and our in this Risk Factors section refer to the Company and its subsidiaries, including the Bank, unless otherwise specified or unless the context otherwise requires. Risks Relating to the Company and the Bank Risks Relating to Macroeconomic Conditions Economic conditions have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our business and financial performance. Our financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services that we offer, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where we operate and in the United States as a whole. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment; political uncertainty, both domestic and international, and other geopolitical events; natural disasters; wars; terrorist acts; pandemics or other public health crises; or a combination of these or other factors. An economic downturn, sustained high unemployment levels, or stock market volatility may negatively impact our operating results and have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, increasing the risk of loan defaults and losses. Since our business is primarily concentrated in Missouri, Iowa, Kansas and Minnesota, a significant downturn in these state or local economies, particularly in the St. Louis and Springfield, Missouri areas, may adversely affect our business. We also have originated a significant dollar amount of loans in Texas and Oklahoma from our commercial loan offices in Dallas and Tulsa. A significant downturn in these states economies may adversely affect our business. Our lending and deposit gathering activities historically were concentrated primarily in the Springfield and southwest Missouri areas. Our success continues to depend heavily on general economic conditions in Springfield and the surrounding areas. Although we believe the economy in these areas has recently been favorable relative to other areas, we do not know whether these conditions will continue. Until the past few years, our greatest concentration of loans and deposits has traditionally been in the Greater Springfield area. With a population of approximately 475,000, the Greater Springfield area is the third largest metropolitan area in Missouri. At December 31, 2022, approximately 327.5 million of our loan portfolio consisted of loans to borrowers in or secured by properties in the Springfield metropolitan area. In addition to the concentrations in the southwest Missouri area, we now have our largest concentration of loans to borrowers in or secured by properties in the St. Louis metropolitan area. At December 31, 2022, approximately 814.1 million of our loan portfolio consisted of loans for apartments, industrial revenue bonds and other types of commercial properties in the St. Louis metropolitan area. Also, we have a significant amount of loans to borrowers in or secured by properties in Texas and Oklahoma. At December 31, 2022, approximately 392.8 million and 175.2 million of our loan portfolio consisted of loans primarily for various types of commercial real estate in the States of Texas and Oklahoma, respectively. 
 46 

Table of Contents 
 With the FDIC-assisted transactions that were completed in 2009-2014, we now have additional concentrations of loans in Western, Eastern and Central Iowa and in the Minneapolis metropolitan area. In more recent years, we opened commercial loan production offices in Atlanta, Chicago and Denver, and in 2022 we opened commercial loan production offices in Phoenix and Charlotte, North Carolina. We expect loan growth in these offices to result in significant loan balances secured by properties located in Georgia, Illinois, Colorado, Arizona and North Carolina. Adverse changes in regional and general economic conditions could reduce our growth rate, impair our ability to collect payments on loans, increase loan delinquencies, increase problem assets and foreclosures, increase claims and lawsuits, decrease demand for our products and services, and decrease the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate, thereby having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Real estate values can also be affected by governmental rules or policies and, as noted in the next risk factor, natural disasters. Inflationary pressures and rising prices may affect our results of operations and financial condition. Inflation has risen sharply since the end of 2021 to levels not seen in more than 40 years. Small to medium-sized businesses may be impacted more during periods of high inflation, as they are not able to leverage economics of scale to mitigate cost pressures compared to larger businesses. Consequently, the ability of our business customers to repay their loans may deteriorate, and in some cases this deterioration may occur quickly, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, a prolonged period of inflation could cause wages and other costs to the Company to increase, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to adversely affect us. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the global and national economy and certain industries and geographies in which our customers reside and operate. Because of its ongoing and dynamic nature, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company and its customers, employees and third-party service providers. The extent of this impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain. Additionally, the responses of various governmental and nongovernmental authorities and consumers to the pandemic may have material long-term effects on the Company and its customers, which are difficult to quantify in the near-term or long-term. We could be subject to a number of risks as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. These risks include, but are not limited to, changes in demand for our products and services; increased loan losses or other impairments in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for loan losses; a decline in collateral for our loans, especially real estate; unanticipated unavailability of employees; increased cyber security risks to the extent employees work remotely; a prolonged weakness in economic conditions; and increased costs as we and our regulators, customers and third-party service providers adapt to evolving pandemic conditions. Severe weather and other natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, new public health issues or other adverse external events could harm our business. Severe weather and other natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, new public health issues or other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. Such events could harm our operations through interference with communications, including the interruption or loss of our computer systems, which could prevent or impede us from gathering deposits, originating loans and processing and controlling the flow of business, as well as through the destruction of our facilities and our operational, financial and management information systems. There is no assurance that our business continuity and disaster recovery program can adequately mitigate these risks. Such events could also affect the stability of our deposit base, cause significant property damage, adversely affect our employees, adversely impact the values of collateral securing our loans and/or interfere with our borrowers abilities to repay their debt obligations to us. Climate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may result in operational changes and expenditures that could significantly impact our business. The current and anticipated effects of climate change are creating an increasing level of concern for the state of the global environment. As a result, political and social attention to the issue of climate change has increased. In recent years, governments 
 47 

Table of Contents 
 across the world have entered into international agreements relating to climate change. The U.S. Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies have continued to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change. Such initiatives are expected to continue, including potentially increasing supervisory expectations with respect to banks risk management practices and credit portfolio concentrations based on climate-related factors, as well as encouraging investment by banks in climate-related initiatives and lending to communities disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change. These measures may result in the imposition of taxes and fees and the implementation of operational changes, each of which may require us to incur significant compliance, operating and other costs. Risks Relating to Lending Activities Our loan portfolio possesses increased risk due to our relatively high concentration of commercial and residential construction, commercial real estate, other residential (multi-family) and other commercial loans. Our commercial and other residential (multi-family) construction, commercial real estate, other residential (multi-family) and other commercial loans accounted for approximately 76.0 of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2022. Generally, we consider these types of loans to involve a higher degree of risk compared to first mortgage loans on one- to four-family, owner-occupied residential properties. At December 31, 2022, including completed projects and those under construction, we had 1.32 billion of loans secured by apartments, 328.6 million of loans secured by retail-related projects, 306.8 million of loans secured by warehouse facilities, 282.9 million of loans secured by healthcare facilities, 275.2 million of loans secured by motels/hotels and 256.6 million of loans secured by office facilities, which are particularly sensitive to certain risks, including the following: large loan balances owed by a single borrower; payments that are dependent on the successful operation of the project; and loans that are more directly impacted by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy generally. 
 The risks associated with construction lending include the borrower s inability to complete the construction process on time and within budget, the sale of the project within projected absorption periods, the economic risks associated with real estate collateral, and the potential of a rising interest rate environment. This activity may involve financing land purchases, infrastructure development (e.g., roads, utilities, etc.), as well as construction of residences or other residential (multi-family) dwellings for subsequent sale by the developer/builder. Because the sale of developed properties is critical to the success of the developer s business, loan repayment may be especially subject to the volatility of real estate market sales activity. Management has established underwriting and monitoring criteria to help minimize the inherent risks of commercial real estate construction lending. However, there is no guarantee that these controls and procedures will reduce losses on this type of lending. Commercial and other residential (multi-family) lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of these loans generally is dependent, in large part, on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Other commercial loans are typically made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower s business or investment. These loans may therefore be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the economy generally. For example, if the cash flow from the borrower s project is reduced due to leases not being obtained or renewed, the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. In addition, many commercial and other residential (multi-family) loans are not fully amortized over the loan period, but have balloon payments due at maturity. A borrower s ability to make a balloon payment typically will depend on being able to either refinance the loan or complete a timely sale of the underlying property. We plan to continue to originate commercial real estate and construction loans based on economic and market conditions. From 2008 to 2013, there was not significant demand for these types of loans due to the economic downturn. In more recent years, demand for these types of loans has increased and we expect to continue to originate these types of loans. Because of the increased risks related to these types of loans, we may determine it necessary to increase the level of our provision for credit losses. Increased provisions for credit losses would adversely impact our operating results. See Item 1. Business-The Company-Lending Activities-Commercial Real Estate and Construction Lending, -Other Commercial Lending, -Residential Real Estate Lending and -Allowance for Losses on Loans and Foreclosed Assets and Item 7.

 A slowdown in the residential or commercial real estate markets may adversely affect our earnings and liquidity position. The overall credit quality of our construction loan portfolio is impacted by trends in real estate values. We continually monitor changes in key regional and national economic factors because changes in these factors can impact our residential and commercial construction loan portfolio and the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. Across the United States for several years, the residential real estate market experienced significant adverse trends, including accelerated price depreciation and rising delinquency and default rates, and weaknesses arose in the commercial real estate market as well. The conditions in the residential real estate market led to significant increases in loan delinquencies and credit losses as well as higher provisioning for credit losses, which in turn had a negative effect on earnings for many banks across the country. Likewise, we also experienced delinquencies in our construction loan portfolio from 2009 through 2012, almost entirely related to loans originated prior to 2009. Many of these older construction projects were build to sell types of projects where repayment of the loans was reliant on the borrower completing the project and then selling it. Conditions of both the residential and the commercial real estate markets could negatively impact real estate values and the ability of our borrowers to liquidate properties. A lack of liquidity in the real estate market or tightening of credit standards within the banking industry could diminish sales, further reducing our borrowers cash flows and weakening their ability to repay their debt obligations to us, which could lead to material adverse impacts on our financial condition and results of operations. Our allowance for credit losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb potential losses in our loan portfolio. Lending money is a substantial part of our business. However, every loan we make carries a certain risk of non-payment. This risk is affected by, among other things: cash flows of the borrower and/or the project being financed; in the case of a collateralized loan, the changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral; the credit history of a particular borrower; changes in economic and industry conditions; and the duration of the loan. 
 The allowance for credit losses is measured using an average historical loss model which incorporates relevant information about past events (including historical credit loss experience on loans with similar risk characteristics), current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the remaining cash flows over the contractual term of the loans. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective (pool) basis. Loans are aggregated into pools based on similar risk characteristics including borrower type, collateral and repayment types and expected credit loss patterns. Average historical loss rates are calculated for each pool using the Company s historical net charge-offs (combined charge-offs and recoveries by observable historical reporting period) and outstanding loan balances during a lookback period. The calculated average net charge-off rate is then adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. These adjustments increase or decrease the average historical loss rate to reflect expectations of future losses given economic forecasts of key macroeconomic variables including, but not limited to, unemployment rate, GDP, disposable income and market volatility. The adjustments are based on results from various regression models projecting the impact of the macroeconomic variables to loss rates. The forecast is used for a reasonable and supportable period before reverting back to historical averages using a straight-line method. The forecast adjusted loss rate is applied to the amortized cost of loans over the remaining contractual lives, adjusted for expected prepayments. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications unless there is a reasonable expectation that a troubled debt restructuring will be executed. Additionally, the allowance for credit losses considers other qualitative factors not included in historical loss rates or macroeconomic forecast such as changes in portfolio composition, underwriting practices, or significant unique events or conditions. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for credit losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

 Risks Relating to Market Interest Rates We may be adversely affected by interest rate changes. Our earnings are largely dependent upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and investment securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular, the FRB. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but these changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, the fair values of our financial assets and liabilities and the average duration of our loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolios. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. In addition, a substantial portion of our loans (approximately 63 of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2022) have adjustable rates of interest. While the higher payment amounts we would receive on these loans in a rising interest rate environment may increase our interest income, some borrowers may be less able to afford the higher payment amounts, which may result in a higher rate of default. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. We generally seek to maintain a reasonably neutral position in terms of the volume of assets and liabilities that mature or re-price during any period. As such, we have adopted asset and liability management strategies to attempt to minimize the potential adverse effects of changes in interest rates on net interest income, primarily by altering the mix and maturity of fixed-rate and variable-rate loans, investments and funding sources, including interest rate derivatives, so that we may reasonably maintain the Company s net interest income and net interest margin. However, interest rate fluctuations, the level and shape of the interest rate yield curve, maintaining excess liquidity levels, loan prepayments, loan production and deposit flows are constantly changing and influence the ability to maintain a neutral position. Accordingly, we may not be successful in maintaining a neutral position and, as a result, our net interest margin may be adversely impacted. For additional information, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate may adversely affect us. Certain loans made by us and financing extended to us are made at variable rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. We also have investments, interest rate derivatives and borrowings that reference LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. On November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration announced its plan to extend the date most U.S. dollar LIBOR values would cease being computed to June 30, 2023. On the same date, the FRB, FDIC and OCC issued a joint statement encouraging banks to cease entering into new contracts that use U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate and no later than December 31, 2021. U.S. banking regulators subsequently said that use of U.S. Dollar LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts after December 31, 2021 would create safety and soundness risks, including litigation, operational and consumer protection risks. Since 2019, the Company has included robust fallback language in its loan documents that allow for an orderly transition from LIBOR to another specified index upon cessation of the LIBOR indices. Some loans remaining that were originated before 2019 do not contain this robust fallback language. At December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 29 commercial loans totaling approximately 49 million of such loans tied to LIBOR indices; however, only 24 of those loans, totaling 40 million, mature after June 2023. The Company also has a portfolio of residential mortgage loans tied to LIBOR indices with standard index replacement language included (approximately 359 million at December 31, 2022), and that portfolio is being monitored for potential changes that may be facilitated by the mortgage industry. In the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates have progressed, and the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) has recommended the use of a Secured Overnight Funding Rate (SOFR). SOFR is different from LIBOR in that it is a backward-looking secured rate rather than a forward-looking unsecured rate. These differences could lead to a greater disconnect between our costs to raise funds for SOFR as compared to LIBOR. The implementation of a substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our borrowers may incur significant expenses in effecting the transition, may result in reduced loan balances if borrowers do not accept the substitute index or indices, and may result in disputes or litigation with customers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute index or indices, which could have

 an adverse effect on our results of operations. These reforms may cause LIBOR to cease to exist, new methods of calculating LIBOR to be established or the establishment of multiple alternative reference rates. These consequences cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us. The fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to market conditions outside of our control. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our investment securities portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, changes in market rates of interest and instability in the credit markets. Any of these mentioned factors could cause an impairment of these assets, which would lead to accounting charges which could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and/or results of operations. Risks Relating to Liquidity Conditions in the financial markets may limit our access to additional funding to meet our liquidity needs. Liquidity is essential to our business, as we must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale or pledging as collateral of loans and other assets could have a substantial adverse effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could negatively affect our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as severe disruption of the financial markets or negative news and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. Our operations may depend upon our continued ability to access brokered deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Due to the high level of competition for deposits in our markets, we have from time to time utilized a sizable amount of certificates of deposit obtained through deposit brokers and advances from the FHLBank to help fund our asset base. Brokered deposits are marketed through national brokerage firms that solicit funds from their customers for deposit in banks, including our bank. Brokered deposits and FHLBank advances may generally be more sensitive to changes in interest rates and volatility in the capital markets than retail deposits attracted through our branch network, and our reliance on these sources of funds increases the sensitivity of our portfolio to these external factors. Our brokered deposits and term FHLBank advances totaled 411.5 million and -0- at December 31, 2022, compared with 67.4 million and -0- at December 31, 2021. We had overnight borrowings from the FHLBank of 88.5 million and -0- at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect to continue to utilize FHLBank advances and overnight borrowings and brokered deposits from time to time as a supplemental funding source. Bank regulators can restrict our access to these sources of funds in certain circumstances. For example, if the Bank s regulatory capital ratios declined below the well-capitalized status, banking regulators would require the Bank to obtain their approval prior to obtaining or renewing brokered deposits. The regulators might not approve our acceptance of brokered deposits in amounts that we desire or at all. In addition, the availability of brokered deposits and the rates paid on these brokered deposits may be volatile as the balance of the supply of and the demand for brokered deposits changes. Market credit and liquidity concerns may also impact the availability and cost of brokered deposits. Similarly, FHLBank advances are only available to borrowers that meet certain conditions. If Great Southern were to cease meeting these conditions, our access to FHLBank advances could be significantly reduced or eliminated. Certain Federal Home Loan Banks, including the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, have experienced lower earnings from time to time and paid out lower dividends to their members. Future problems at the Federal Home Loan Banks may impact the collateral necessary to secure borrowings and limit the borrowings extended to its member banks, as well as require additional capital contributions by its member banks. If this occurs, our short term liquidity needs could be negatively impacted. Should Great Southern be restricted from using FHLBank advances due to weakness in the system or with the FHLBank of Des Moines, Great Southern may be forced to find alternative funding sources. These alternative funding sources may include the utilization of existing lines of credit with third party banks or the Federal Reserve Bank along with seeking other lines of credit, borrowing under repurchase agreement lines, increasing deposit rates to attract additional funds, accessing additional brokered deposits, or selling loans or investment

 securities in order to maintain adequate levels of liquidity. At December 31, 2022, the Bank owned 10.1 million of stock in the FHLBank of Des Moines, which declared and paid an annualized dividend approximating 7.25 during the fourth quarter of 2022. The FHLBank of Des Moines may eliminate or reduce dividend payments at any time in the future in order for it to maintain or restore its retained earnings. Risks Relating to Future Growth Our strategy of pursuing acquisitions exposes us to financial, execution and operational risks that could adversely affect us. We have in the past pursued, and may again in the future pursue, a strategy of supplementing internal growth by acquiring other financial institutions or branches that we believe will help us fulfill our strategic objectives and enhance our earnings. There are risks associated with this strategy, however, including the following: We may be exposed to potential asset quality issues or unknown or contingent liabilities of the banks or businesses we acquire. If these issues or liabilities exceed our estimates, our earnings and financial condition may be adversely affected; Prices at which acquisitions can be made fluctuate with market conditions. We have experienced times during which acquisitions could not be made in specific markets at prices our management considered acceptable and expect that we will experience this condition in the future in one or more markets; The acquisition of other entities generally requires integration of systems, procedures and personnel of the acquired entity in order to make the transaction economically feasible. This integration process is complicated and time consuming and can also be disruptive to the customers of the acquired business. If the integration process is not conducted successfully and with minimal effect on the acquired business and its customers, we may not realize the anticipated economic benefits of particular acquisitions within the expected time frame or to the extent anticipated, and we may lose customers or employees of the acquired business. We may also experience greater than anticipated customer losses even if the integration process is successful; To finance an acquisition, we may borrow funds, thereby increasing our leverage and diminishing our liquidity, or raise additional capital, which could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders; and We may not be able to continue to sustain our past rate of growth or to grow at all in the future. We completed two acquisitions in 2009, one acquisition in 2011, one acquisition in 2012, one acquisition in 2014 and opened additional banking offices and commercial loan production offices in recent years that enhanced our rate of growth. Also in 2014, we acquired certain loans, deposits and branches from Boulevard Bank, and in 2016, we completed an acquisition of certain loans, deposits and branches in St. Louis from Fifth Third Bank. 
 Our growth or future losses may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed. If available, the cost of that capital may also be very high. We are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. In addition, we may elect to raise additional capital to support the growth of our business or to finance acquisitions, if any, or we may elect to raise additional capital for other reasons. Should we be required by regulatory authorities or otherwise elect to raise additional capital, we may seek to do so through the issuance of, among other things, our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock, which could dilute your ownership interest in the Company. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed or desired, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot make assurances of our ability to raise additional capital if needed or desired, or on terms that will be acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed or desired, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.

 Risks Relating to Competition Our future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry. We face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of different competitors. Our future growth and success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive environment. To date, we have grown our business successfully by focusing on our geographic market, expanding into complementary markets and emphasizing the high level of service and responsiveness desired by our customers. We compete for loans, deposits and other financial services with other commercial banks, thrifts, credit unions, consumer finance companies, insurance companies and brokerage firms. Many of our competitors offer products and services that we do not offer, and many have substantially greater resources, name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business. In addition, larger competitors (including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in our market areas) may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do, and smaller and newer competitors may also be more aggressive in terms of pricing loan and deposit products than us in order to obtain a larger share of the market. As we have grown, we have become dependent from time to time on outside funding sources, including funds borrowed from the FHLBank and brokered deposits, where we face nationwide competition. Some of the financial institutions and financial services organizations with which we compete are not subject to the same degree of regulation as is imposed on insured depositary institutions and their holding companies. As a result, these non-bank competitors have certain advantages over us in accessing funding and in providing various services. We also experience competition from a variety of institutions outside of our market areas. Some of these institutions conduct business primarily over the Internet and may thus be able to realize certain cost savings and offer products and services at more favorable rates and with greater convenience to the customer. Risks Relating to Regulation Our business may be adversely affected by the highly regulated environment in which we operate, including the various capital adequacy guidelines we are required to meet. We are subject to extensive federal and state legislation, regulation, examination and supervision. Recently enacted, proposed and future legislation and regulations have had, will continue to have, or may have an adverse effect on our business and operations. Our success depends on our continued ability to maintain compliance with the various regulations to which we are subject. Some of these regulations may increase our costs and thus place other financial institutions in stronger, more favorable competitive positions. We cannot predict what restrictions may be imposed upon us by future legislation. See Item 1.-The Company -Government Supervision and Regulation in this Report. The Company and the Bank are required to meet certain regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements imposed by the FRB, the FDIC and the Missouri Division of Finance. If the Company or the Bank fails to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and could compromise the status of the Company as a financial holding company. See Item 1.-The Company -Government Supervision and Regulation in this Report. Risks Relating to Technology and Cybersecurity and Other Operational Matters Our exposure to operational risks may adversely affect us. Similar to other financial institutions, we are exposed to many types of operational risk, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, the risk that sensitive customer or Company data is compromised, unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors. If any of these risks occur, it could result in material adverse consequences for us.

 We continually encounter technological change, and we may have fewer resources than many of our competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements. The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our clients. The Company plans to convert its core operating systems and may encounter significant adverse developments. The Company plans to replace its core operating systems, including those for loans, deposits, financials and other ancillary systems (collectively referred to as core system). The core system is used to track customer relationships and accounts and report financial information for the Company. The core system is integrated with various other applications that are used to service customer requests by bank personnel or directly by customers (such as online banking and mobile applications). Changing the core system will subject the Company to operational risks during and after the conversion, including disruptions to its technology systems, which may adversely impact our customers. The Company has plans, policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the risks of a failure during or after the conversion of our core system. However, there can be no assurance that any such adverse developments will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be timely and adequately remediated. The ultimate impact of any adverse development could damage the Company s reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject the Company to regulatory scrutiny, or expose it to civil litigation and possibly financial liability, any of which could have a material effect on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations. We are also subject to security-related risks in connection with our use of technology, and our security measures may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of a cyber-attack or to protect us from systems failures or interruptions. Communications and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business. We use such systems to manage our client relationships, our general ledger and virtually all other aspects of our business. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, the security of our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code and cyber-attacks that could have a security impact. If one or more of these events occur, this could jeopardize our or our clients confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our clients or counterparties. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us. We could also suffer significant reputational damage. As a service to our clients, we currently offer an Internet PC banking product and a smartphone application for iPhone and Android users. Use of these services involves the transmission of confidential information over public networks. We cannot be sure that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will not result in a compromise or breach in the commercially available encryption and authentication technology that we use to protect our clients transaction data. If we were to experience such a breach or compromise, we could suffer losses and reputational damage and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. While we have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures and interruptions, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do. In addition, we outsource certain aspects of our data processing and other operational functions to certain third-party providers. If our third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty in communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely impacted. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of client information through various other vendors and their personnel.

 The occurrence of any systems failure or interruption could damage our reputation and result in a loss of clients and business, or could expose us to legal liability. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our controls and procedures may be ineffective. We regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures. As a result, we may incur increased costs to maintain and improve our controls and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls or procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Risks Relating to Accounting Matters Our accounting policies and methods impact how we report our financial condition and results of operations. Application of these policies and methods may require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain. Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances yet might result in our reporting materially different amounts than would have been reported under a different alternative. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the accompanying audited financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. These accounting policies are critical to presenting our financial condition and results of operations. They may require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Changes in accounting standards could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. The accounting standard setters, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board, Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory bodies, from time to time may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in changes to previously reported financial results, or a cumulative charge to retained earnings. New accounting standards have resulted in a significant change to our recognition of credit losses and may materially impact our financial condition or results of operations. In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued authoritative accounting guidance under ASC Topic 326 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses amending the incurred loss impairment methodology under GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses (referred to as the CECL model and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information for credit loss estimates, which we adopted on January 1, 2021. Under the incurred loss model utilized until 2021, we delayed recognition of losses until it was probable that a loss was incurred. The CECL model represents a dramatic departure from the incurred loss model. The CECL model requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected (net of the allowance for credit losses). Similarly, the credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities are recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than a write-down. In addition, the measurement of expected credit losses takes place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet (with periodic updates thereafter) and is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. As such, the CECL model impacts how we determine our allowance for credit losses and may require us to significantly increase our allowance for credit losses. Furthermore, we may experience more fluctuations in our allowance for credit losses, which may be significant. If we are required to materially increase our allowance for credit losses, it may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.

 Risks Relating to our Common Stock The price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell our common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive. We cannot predict how our common stock will trade in the future. The market value of our common stock will likely continue to fluctuate in response to a number of factors including the following, most of which are beyond our control, as well as the other factors described in this Risk Factors section: actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating and financial results; developments related to investigations, proceedings or litigation that involve us; changes in financial estimates and recommendations by financial analysts; dispositions, acquisitions and financings; 
 actions of our current stockholders, including sales of common stock by existing stockholders and our directors and executive officers; fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors; regulatory developments; and other developments related to the financial services industry. 
 The market value of our common stock may also be affected by conditions affecting the financial markets in general, including price and trading fluctuations. These conditions may result in (i) volatility in the level of, and fluctuations in, the market prices of stocks generally and, in turn, our common stock and (ii) sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the market, in each case that could be unrelated or disproportionate to changes in our operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market value of our common stock. Our common stock also has a low average daily trading volume relative to many other stocks, which may limit an investor s ability to quickly accumulate or divest themselves of large blocks of our stock. This can lead to significant price swings even when a relatively small number of shares are being traded. There may be future sales of additional common stock or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We are not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities. The market value of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by us of a large number of shares of common stock or preferred stock or similar securities in the market or the perception that such sales could occur. Our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue additional common stock, as well as classes or series of preferred stock, generally without any action on the part of the stockholders. In addition, the board has the power, generally without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights and preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends or upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our business and other terms. If we issue preferred stock in the future that has a preference over the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock, the rights of holders of the common stock or the market value of the common stock could be adversely affected.

 Regulatory and contractual restrictions may limit or prevent us from paying dividends on and repurchasing our common stock. Great Southern Bancorp, Inc. is an entity separate and distinct from its principal subsidiary, Great Southern Bank, and derives substantially all of its revenue in the form of dividends from that subsidiary. Accordingly, Great Southern Bancorp, Inc. is and will be dependent upon dividends from the Bank to pay the principal of and interest on its indebtedness, to satisfy its other cash needs and to pay dividends on its common stock. The Bank s ability to pay dividends is subject to its ability to earn net income and to meet certain regulatory requirements. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to Great Southern Bancorp, Inc., Great Southern Bancorp, Inc. may not be able to pay dividends on its common stock. Also, Great Southern Bancorp, Inc. s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors. As described below in the next risk factor, the terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities prohibit us from paying dividends on or repurchasing our common stock at any time when we have elected to defer the payment of interest on such debt securities or certain events of default under the terms of those debt securities have occurred and are continuing. These restrictions could have a negative effect on the value of our common stock. Moreover, holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when, as and if declared by our board of directors. Although we have historically paid cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and our board of directors could reduce, suspend or eliminate our common stock cash dividend in the future. If we defer payments of interest on our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities or if certain defaults relating to those debt securities occur, we will be prohibited from declaring or paying dividends or distributions on, and from making liquidation payments with respect to, our common stock. As of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding 25.8 million aggregate principal amount of junior subordinated debt securities issued in connection with the sale of trust preferred securities by one of our subsidiaries that is a statutory business trust. We have also guaranteed those trust preferred securities. The indenture governing the junior subordinated debt securities, together with the related guarantee, prohibits us, subject to limited exceptions, from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on, or redeeming, repurchasing, acquiring or making any liquidation payments with respect to, any of our capital stock (including any preferred stock and our common stock) at any time when (i) there shall have occurred and be continuing an event of default under the indenture or any event, act or condition that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute an event of default under the indenture; or (ii) we are in default with respect to payment of any obligations under the related guarantee; or (iii) we have deferred payment of interest on the junior subordinated debt securities. In that regard, we are entitled, at our option but subject to certain conditions, to defer payments of interest on the junior subordinated debt securities from time to time for up to five years. Events of default under the indenture generally consist of our failure to pay interest on the junior subordinated debt securities under certain circumstances, our failure to pay any principal of or premium on the junior subordinated debt securities when due, our failure to comply with certain covenants under the indenture, and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation relating to us or the Bank. As a result of these provisions, if we were to elect to defer payments of interest on the junior subordinated debt securities, or if any of the other events described in clause (i) or (ii) of the first paragraph of this risk factor were to occur, we would be prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends on our stock, from redeeming, repurchasing or otherwise acquiring any of our stock, and from making any payments to holders of our stock in the event of our liquidation, which would likely have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock. Moreover, without notice to or consent from our stockholders, we may issue additional series of junior subordinated debt securities in the future with terms similar to those of our existing junior subordinated debt securities or enter into other financing agreements that limit our ability to purchase or to pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock, including our common stock. The voting limitation provision in our charter could limit your voting rights as a holder of our common stock. Our charter provides that any person or group who acquires beneficial ownership of our common stock in excess of 10.0 of the outstanding shares may not vote the excess shares. Accordingly, if you acquire beneficial ownership of more than 10.0 of the outstanding shares of our common stock, your voting rights with respect to the common stock will not be commensurate with your economic interest in the Company.

 Anti-takeover provisions could adversely impact our stockholders. Provisions in our charter and bylaws, the corporate law of the state of Maryland and federal regulations could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us, despite the possible benefit to our stockholders, or otherwise adversely affect the market price of any class of our equity securities, including our common stock. These provisions include: a prohibition on voting shares of common stock beneficially owned in excess of 10 of total shares outstanding, supermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations with any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of our outstanding common stock; the election of directors to staggered terms of three years; advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that stockholders may act on at stockholder meetings, a requirement that only directors may fill a vacancy in our board of directors, and supermajority voting requirements to remove any of our directors. Our charter also authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock , and preferred stock could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal. In addition, because we are a bank holding company, purchasers of 10 or more of our common stock may be required to obtain approvals under the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, or the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (and in certain cases such approvals may be required at a lesser percentage of ownership). Specifically, under regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve Board, (a) any other bank holding company may be required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire or retain 5 or more of our common stock and (b) any person other than a bank holding company may be required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire or retain 10 or more of our common stock. These provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. These provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for holders of our common stock to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board of directors. Three members of the Turner family may exert substantial influence over the Company through their board and management positions and their ownership of the Company s stock. The Company s Chairman of the Board, William V. Turner, and the Company s Director, President and Chief Executive Officer, Joseph W. Turner, are father and son, respectively. Julie Turner Brown, a director of the Company, is the sister of Joseph Turner and the daughter of William Turner. These three Turner family members hold three of the Company s nine Board positions. As of December 31, 2022, they also collectively beneficially owned approximately 2,106,096 shares of the Company s common stock (excluding 69,250 shares underlying stock options exercisable as of or within 60 days after that date), representing approximately 17.2 of total shares outstanding, though they are subject to the voting limitation provision in our charter which precludes any person or group with beneficial ownership in excess of 10 of total shares outstanding from voting shares in excess of that threshold. Through their board and management positions and their ownership of the Company s stock, these three members of the Turner family may exert substantial influence over the direction of the Company and the outcome of Board and stockholder votes. In addition to the Turner family members, we are aware of other beneficial owners of more than five percent of the outstanding shares of our common stock. One of these beneficial owners is also a director of the Company. As of December 31, 2022, one of the Company s directors, Earl A. Steinert, beneficially owned 939,596 shares of our common stock (excluding 5,000 shares underlying stock options exercisable as of or within 60 days after that date), representing approximately 7.7 of total shares outstanding. The shares that can be voted by the Turner family members (1,223,129 shares as of December 31, 2022, per the ten percent voting limitation in our charter) and the shares beneficially owned by Mr. Steinert (939,596) total 2,162,725, representing approximately 17.7 of total shares outstanding. While they have no agreement to do so, to the extent they vote in the same manner, these stockholders may be able to exercise influence over the management and business affairs of our Company. For example, using their collective voting power, these stockholders may be able to affect the outcome of director elections or block significant transactions, such as a merger or acquisition, or any other matter that might otherwise be favored by other stockholders.

 Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Allowance for Credit Losses and Valuation of Foreclosed Assets The Company believes that the determination of the allowance for credit losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies. The allowance for credit losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining an allowance level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is measured using an average historical loss model that incorporates relevant information about past events (including historical credit loss experience on loans with similar risk characteristics), current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the remaining cash flows over the contractual term of the loans. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective (pool) basis. Loans are aggregated into pools based on similar risk characteristics, including borrower type, collateral and repayment types and expected credit loss patterns. Loans that do not share similar risk characteristics, primarily classified and/or TDR loans with a balance greater than or equal to 100,000 which are classified or restructured troubled debt, are evaluated on an individual basis. For loans evaluated for credit losses on a collective basis, average historical loss rates are calculated for each pool using the Company s historical net charge-offs (combined charge-offs and recoveries by observable historical reporting period) and outstanding loan balances during a lookback period. Lookback periods can be different based on the individual pool and represent management s credit expectations for the pool of loans over the remaining contractual life. In certain loan pools, if the Company s own historical loss rate is not reflective of the loss expectations, the historical loss rate is augmented by industry and peer data. The calculated average net charge-off rate is then adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. These adjustments increase or decrease the average historical loss rate to reflect expectations of future losses given economic forecasts of key macroeconomic variables including, but not limited to, unemployment rate, GDP, disposable income and market volatility. The adjustments are based on results from various regression models projecting the impact of the macroeconomic variables to loss rates. The forecast is used for a reasonable and supportable period before reverting back to historical averages using a straight-line method. The forecast adjusted loss rate is applied to the amortized cost of loans over the remaining contractual lives, adjusted for expected prepayments. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications unless there is a reasonable expectation that a troubled debt restructuring will be executed. Additionally, the allowance for credit losses considers other qualitative factors not included in historical loss rates or macroeconomic forecast such as changes in portfolio composition, underwriting practices, or significant unique events or conditions. See Note 3 Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses included in Item 1 for additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses. Inherent in this process is the evaluation of individual significant credit relationships. From time to time certain credit relationships may deteriorate due to payment performance, cash flow of the borrower, value of collateral, or other factors. In these instances, management may revise its loss estimates and assumptions for these specific credits due to changing circumstances. In some cases, additional losses may be realized; in other instances, the factors that led to the deterioration may improve or the credit may be refinanced elsewhere and allocated allowances may be released from the particular credit. Significant changes were made to management s overall methodology for evaluating the allowance for credit losses during the periods presented in the financial statements of this report due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13. On January 1, 2021, the Company adopted the new accounting standard related to the Allowance for Credit Losses. For assets held at amortized cost basis, this standard eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold in GAAP and, instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected credit losses. See Note 3 of the accompanying financial statements for additional information. In addition, the Company considers that the determination of the valuations of foreclosed assets held for sale involves a high degree of judgment and complexity. The carrying value of foreclosed assets reflects management s best estimate of the amount to be realized from the sales of the assets. While the estimate is generally based on a valuation by an independent appraiser or recent sales of similar 
 65

 properties, the amount that the Company realizes from the sales of the assets could differ materially from the carrying value reflected in the financial statements, resulting in losses that could adversely impact earnings in future periods. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are subject to an impairment test at least annually and more frequently if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a process that estimates the fair value of each of the Company s reporting units compared with its carrying value. The Company defines reporting units as a level below each of its operating segments for which there is discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has one reporting unit to which goodwill has been allocated the Bank. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then no impairment is recorded. If the carrying value amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit, further testing is completed comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment. Intangible assets that are not amortized will be tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair values of those assets to their carrying values. At December 31, 2022, goodwill consisted of 5.4 million at the Bank reporting unit, which included goodwill of 4.2 million that was recorded during 2016 related to the acquisition of 12 branches and related deposits in the St. Louis market. Other identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of seven years. In April 2022, the Company, through its subsidiary Great Southern Bank, entered into a naming rights agreement with Missouri State University related to the main arena on the university s campus in Springfield, Missouri. The terms of the agreement provide the naming rights to Great Southern Bank for a total cost of 5.5 million, to be paid over a period of seven years. The Company expects to amortize the intangible asset through non-interest expense over a period not to exceed 15 years. At December 31, 2022, the amortizable intangible assets consisted of core deposit intangibles of 53,000 and the arena naming rights of 5.4 million. These amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable based on a comparison of fair value. See Note 1 of the accompanying audited financial statements for additional information. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the Company used a market approach to value its reporting unit. The market approach applies a market multiple, based on observed purchase transactions for each reporting unit, to the metrics appropriate for the valuation of the operating unit. Significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment. This judgment may include developing cash flow projections, selecting appropriate discount rates, identifying relevant market comparables and incorporating general economic and market conditions. Based on the Company s goodwill impairment testing, management does not believe any of the Company s goodwill or other intangible assets were impaired as of December 31, 2022. While management believes no impairment existed at December 31, 2022, different conditions or assumptions used to measure fair value of the reporting unit, or changes in cash flows or profitability, if significantly negative or unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of the Company s impairment evaluation in the future. Current Economic Conditions Changes in economic conditions could cause the values of assets and liabilities recorded in the financial statements to change rapidly, resulting in material future adjustments in asset values, the allowance for credit losses, or capital that could negatively affect the Company s ability to meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. Following the housing and mortgage crisis and correction beginning in mid-2007, the United States entered an economic downturn. Unemployment rose from 4.7 in November 2007 to peak at 10.0 in October 2009. Economic conditions improved in the subsequent years, as indicated by higher consumer confidence levels, increased economic activity and low unemployment levels. The U.S. economy continued to operate at historically strong levels until the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, which severely affected tourism, labor markets, business travel, immigration and the global supply chain, among other areas. The economy plunged into recession in the first quarter of 2020, as efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus forced all but essential business activity, or any work that could not be done from home, to stop, shuttering factories, restaurants, entertainment, sports events, retail shops, personal services, and more. Currently, the pandemic continues to recede and is thus becoming less disruptive to the U.S. and global economies. While there are likely to be future waves of the virus, governments, households and businesses are increasingly adept at adjusting to the virus. More than 22 million jobs in the U.S. were lost in March and April 2020 as businesses closed their doors or reduced their operations, sending employees home on furlough or layoffs. Hunkered down at home with uncertain incomes and limited buying opportunities,

 consumer spending plummeted. As a result, gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest measure of the nation s economic output, plunged. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act CARES Act ), a fiscal relief bill passed by Congress and signed by the President in March 2020, injected approximately 3 trillion into the economy through direct payments to individuals and loans to small businesses that would help keep employees on their payroll, fueling a historic bounce-back in economic activity. Total fiscal support to the economy throughout the pandemic, including the CARES Act passed into law in March 2020, the American Rescue Plan of March 2021, and several smaller fiscal packages, totaled well over 5 trillion. The amount of this support was equal to almost 25 of pre-pandemic 2019 GDP and approximately three times that provided during the global financial crisis of 2007-2008. Additionally, the Federal Reserve slashed its benchmark interest rate to near zero and ensured credit availability to businesses, households, and municipal governments. The Federal Reserve s efforts largely insulated the financial system from the problems in the economy, a significant difference from the financial crisis of 2007-2008. Purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities totaling 120 billion each month by the Federal Reserve commenced shortly after the pandemic began. In November 2021, the Federal Reserve began to taper its quantitative easing (QE), winding down its bond purchases with its final open market purchase conducted on March 9, 2022. The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds interest rate 4.25 in 2022 and indicates that it expects to continue to further tighten monetary policy. Policymakers are strongly signaling they will raise rates further into 2023, and that they will allow the Fed s balance sheet to shrink through quantitative tightening. The federal government deficit was 2.8 trillion in fiscal 2021, close to 1.4 trillion in fiscal 2022, and is expected to narrow to 850 billion in fiscal 2023. The publicly traded debt-to-GDP ratio is near 95 , up from 80 prior to the pandemic and 35 prior to the global financial crisis. Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 2.9 in the fourth quarter of 2022 according to the advance estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the third quarter of 2022, real GDP increased 3.2 . The increase in the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily reflected increases in inventory investment and consumer spending that were partly offset by a decrease in housing investment. Prompting the Fed to take such a hawkish policy stance is the painfully high inflation, prompted largely by pandemic-related disruptions to global supply chains and labor markets, and Russia s invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up oil and other commodity prices. Adding to the pressure to act is the resilient growth in jobs, low unemployment in the mid-3s (consistent with full employment), and overly strong wage growth. The unemployment rate returned to its post-pandemic low of 3.5 , and it did so even as the labor force expanded by 439,000 and the participation rate edged higher to 62.3 . The unemployment rate was down or unchanged across most major demographic groups. However, the least educated workers saw an increase in joblessness from 4.4 to 5 . The Fed increased the fed funds rate by 50 basis points at the December 2022 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and by another 25 basis points at its meeting on January 31 February 1, 2023. This brought the funds rate target to 4.5 to 4.75 . The Fed also continues to allow the assets on its balance sheet, including more than 8 trillion remaining in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, to mature and prepay. Nearly 100 billion in securities are expected to run off monthly. Persistent shortages of materials and labor and snags in supply chains have caused prices to vault higher for months. The annual increase in the inflation rate as of December 2022 was 6.5 compared to December 2021 as measured by the consumer price index. The recently passed Inflation Reduction Act raises nearly 750 billion over the next decade through higher taxes on large corporations and wealthy individuals and lower Medicare prescription drug costs, to pay for nearly 450 billion in tax credits and deductions and additional government spending to address climate change and lower health insurance premiums for Americans who benefit from the Affordable Care Act. The remaining more than 300 billion is intended to go toward reducing future budget deficits. OPEC s recent decision to cut its production quotas has pushed oil prices back up toward 100 per barrel. Prices had slumped to less than 90 per barrel on a weaker global economy and oil demand, the strong U.S. dollar, and the European Union s slow implementation of sanctions on its imports of Russian oil. Ten-year Treasury yields are close to 4 as global bond investors digest the implications of the Fed s aggressive monetary actions. Yields are consistent with their estimated long-run equilibrium, which is consistent with Moody s Analytic s estimate of nominal potential GDP growth of 4 (2 long-run inflation plus 2 real potential GDP growth).

 The national unemployment rate edged down to 3.5 in December 2022, a decrease from 3.9 in December 2021. The number of unemployed individuals decreased to 5.7 million, with the economy adding 223,000 jobs in December 2022. The economy has added 4.5 million jobs for a total of more than 10.7 million new jobs over the past two years. Unemployment levels have now recovered to pre-pandemic levels as of February 2020 when the unemployment rate registered at 3.5 and there were 5.7 million unemployed individuals. Notable job gains occurring in December 2022 were in the leisure and hospitality, healthcare, construction and social assistance sectors. Job cuts in technology and housing have occurred in recent months due to concerns of a recession as the Federal Reserve aggressively tightens monetary policy to quell inflation. As of December 2022, the labor force participation rate (the share of working-age Americans employed or actively looking for a job) remained little changed at 62.3 . The unemployment rate for the Midwest, where the Company conducts most of its business, has decreased from 4 in December 2021 to 3.6 in December 2022. Unemployment rates for December 2022 in the states where the Company has a branch or loan production offices were Arizona at 4.0 , Arkansas at 3.6 , Colorado at 3.3 , Georgia at 3.0 , Illinois at 4.7 , Iowa at 3.1 , Kansas at 2.9 , Minnesota at 2.5 , Missouri at 2.8 , Nebraska at 2.6 , North Carolina at 3.9 , Oklahoma at 3.4 , and Texas at 3.9 . Of the metropolitan areas in which the Company does business, most are below the national unemployment rate of 3.5 for December 2022, with the major outlier being Chicago at 4.2 . Single Family Housing Sales of new single-family houses in December 2022 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 616,000, according to U.S. Census Bureau and Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates. This is 2.3 above the revised November 2022 rate of 602,000 but 28.6 below the December 2021 estimate of 839,000. An estimated 644,000 new homes were sold in 2022. This is 16.4 below the 2021 total of 771,000. The median new home sales price in December 2022 was 442,100, up from 410,000 in December 2021. The average sales price in December 2022 of 528,400 was up from 491,000 in December 2021. The inventory of new homes for sale, at an estimated 461,000 at the end of December 2022, would support 9.0 months of sales at the current sales rate. National existing-home sales in December 2022 declined for the eleventh consecutive month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.02 million. Sales were down 1.5 from November 2022 and 34.0 from December 2021. Existing home sales in the Midwest slid 1.0 from November 2022 to an annual rate of 1.01 million in December 2022, falling 30.3 from December 2021 sales. The median existing-home sales price nationally as of December 30, 2022 climbed 2.3 to 366,900 from 358,800 as of December 2021. This marked 130 consecutive months of year-over-year increases, the longest running streak on record. The median price in the Midwest was 262,000, up 2.9 from the prior year median Midwest price. Nationally, properties on average remained on the market for 26 days in December 2022, up from 24 days in November 2022 and 19 days in December 2021. The inventory of unsold existing homes at the end of December 2022 was 970,000, which was down 13.4 from November 2022 but up 10.2 from December 2021. Unsold inventory in December 2022 represents 2.9 months supply at the current monthly sales pace, down from 3.3 months in November but up from 1.7 months in December 2021. The housing market continues to feel the impact of sharply rising mortgage rates and higher inflation on housing affordability. If consumer price inflation continues to remain at current levels, mortgage rates can be expected to move higher. Additionally, while home prices have consistently increased due to tight supply, prices may decline as available inventory increases due to lower demand. First-time buyers accounted for 31 of sales in December 2022, up from 28 in November 2022 and 30 in December 2021. According to Freddie Mac, the average commitment rate for a 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgage was 6.33 as of December 2022 which is up from 3.56 as of December 2021. The average for all of 2022 was 5.34 .

 Multi-Family Housing and Commercial Real Estate During 2021, multi-family demand significantly outpaced supply additions and drove rent growth to new records. In 2022, demand receded well below new deliveries as economic uncertainty held back household formations. With new deliveries outpacing demand, national year-over-year rent growth pulled back dramatically from 11.0 to 3.1 Midwest and Northeast markets fared the best over the past 12 months, with rent growth down marginally. St. Louis and Kansas City registered 2022 annual rent growth of 5.7 , which remains significantly higher than their 5-year pre-pandemic average. The overall downward movement of rents may continue during 2023 as the risk of recession hangs over the economy, holding back multifamily demand. Nationally, absorption totaled only 141,000 units in 2022, well below the record totals posted in 2021 but also below average compared to pre-pandemic figures. This is a concern as the majority of demand occurred during the first two quarters of the year and trended much weaker in the second half of 2022. The tempering of demand was likely due to rising inflation cutting into potential renter households budgets. The moderating absorption nationally conversely hit at an inopportune time, as 435,000 new units were delivered during the fourth quarter of 2022. The resulting supply/demand imbalance pushed the vacancy rate up to up to 6.5 . While no oversupply of multifamily exists nationally, there are several markets in which construction deliveries have outpaced recent demand growth. Vacancy rates in 1 2 Star and the 3 Star properties remain below the national 6.3 vacancy rate. On the other side of the price spectrum, 4 5 Star assets have recently been witnessing a vacancy rate increase after hitting an all-time low in the third quarter of 2021 of 6.4 . The 4 5 Star vacancy rate since then has increased to 8.3 at the end of 2022. As most new developments are luxury mid- and high-rise buildings, a slowing of demand at this price point will immediately impact overall vacancy rates. New developments at the luxury price point cannot readily increase demand for their units by trying to draw 3 Star households with large concession packages. Therefore, the potential demand for newly developed 4 5 Star properties remains dependent on an expanding pool of high-income renter households. Investment capital remained focused on the multifamily sector during the fourth quarter of 2022, as multifamily transaction activity topped the four major real estate sectors. However, the combination of rising interest rates, more expensive debt and lower pro-forma rents may lead to 4 and 5 Star cap rates rising during 2023. Some investors have already moved to the sidelines as they await further signaling on the direction of economic growth and the Federal Reserve s inflation fighting. As of December 31, 2022, national multifamily market vacancy rates increased to 6.4 . Our market areas reflected the following apartment vacancy levels as of December 2022: Springfield, Missouri at 3.1 , St. Louis at 8.7 , Kansas City at 6.7 , Minneapolis at 7.4 , Tulsa, Oklahoma at 8.1 , Dallas-Fort Worth at 8.2 , Chicago at 5.4 , Atlanta at 9.0 , Phoenix at 9.2 , Denver at 7.7 and Charlotte, North Carolina at 8.8 . Job growth in major office-using industries turned negative at the end of 2022. The pace of layoffs accelerated, especially in the technology sector, which had previously been in an expansion mode. Uncertainty remains the prevailing theme, as firms continue to debate workplace schedules and assess real estate requirements. Multiple factors could stress both office leasing and sales activity and pricing in the office market going forward; including higher interest rates and subsequent cost of debt, slowing economic growth and a continued shift to remote and hybrid workplace schedules. The current oversupply of available space, both existing and forthcoming, point to downside risk with a full recovery in the office market likely a long-term proposition. As of December 31, 2022, national office vacancy rates increased to 12.7 from 12.5 as of September 30, 2022, while our market areas reflected the following vacancy levels at December 31, 2022: Springfield, Missouri at 4.3 , St. Louis at 10.2 , Kansas City at 10.6 , Minneapolis at 10.9 , Tulsa, Oklahoma at 11.3 , Dallas-Fort Worth at 17.7 , Chicago at 15.2 , Atlanta at 14.2 , Denver at 14.7 , Phoenix at 15.2 and Charlotte, North Carolina at 12.1 . The retail sector remains in expansion mode despite growing headwinds from inflation and rising interest rates. Overall, consumers continue to spend at a very healthy clip, though the increased cost of necessities such as food, gas, and housing are starting to weigh on the real growth of spending for non-essential goods. Leasing activity for smaller spaces is being overwhelmingly driven by growth

 in quick service restaurants and cellular service retailers. While demand for retail space is on the rise, construction activity continues to fall. Most recent construction activity has consisted of single-tenant build-to-suits or smaller ground floor spaces in mixed-use developments. Due to growing demand and minimal new supply, vacancy rates declined across most retail segments as of fourth quarter of 2022. Rents increased at 3.8 over the most recent 12 month period, with retail tenants appearing to shrug off concerns surrounding inflation, rising interest rates and a potential recession. However, rent growth has slowed in each of the past two quarters and is forecast to decelerate further over coming quarters due to above-average inflation. During the fourth quarter of 2022, national retail vacancy rates declined slightly to 4.2 while our market areas reflected the following vacancy levels: Springfield, Missouri at 3.3 , St. Louis at 5.1 , Kansas City at 4.2 , Minneapolis at 3.1 , Tulsa, Oklahoma at 3.2 , Dallas-Fort Worth at 4.7 , Chicago at 5.4 , Atlanta at 3.8 , Phoenix at 5.2 , Denver at 4.0 , and Charlotte, North Carolina at 3.5 . The U.S. has been in the midst of a historic boom in household spending on retail goods (both online and in store), all of which need to be stored in logistics properties across the country before reaching the end consumer. U.S. industrial leasing has held up remarkably well despite rising interest rates and stubbornly high inflation rates eroding household purchasing power. Even when adjusted for inflation, consumer goods sales are still booming and coming in well above their pre-pandemic growth trend every month. The supply of U.S. industrial properties is set to grow by almost 4 in 2023, marking the fastest pace of supply growth the market has seen in more than three decades. Construction starts on new industrial projects peaked during the first three quarters of 2022. With typical construction times for these projects of about one year, deliveries look set to remain elevated throughout 2023. Amid increased concerns of rising interest rates causing values of newly-delivered projects to dip below replacement costs, developers pulled back 30-40 on construction starts during fourth quarter of 2022. This pullback signals that by spring 2024, the number of new projects completing construction each quarter will begin to slow. This slowdown will somewhat be mitigated by the planned opening of 18+ electric vehicle, battery and semiconductor plants across the U.S. during 2024-2025 which may result in millions of additional square footage leasing over that period. A decline in rent growth during 2024-25 is anticipated due the elevated deliveries with industrial rent growth already slowing heading into 2023, from the 3 quarterly gains recorded a year ago to 2 quarterly growth as of first quarter 2023. Increases in rent growth look unlikely in 2023, as landlords may be contending with a high number of speculative development projects completing at a time when 2022 s sharp interest rate increases will likely still be weighing on the macro economy. At December 31, 2022, national industrial vacancy rates increased slightly to 4.2 over the previously recorded record low of 4.0 during third quarter 2022. Our market areas reflected the following vacancy levels: Springfield, Missouri at 1.2 , St. Louis at 4.2 , Kansas City at 3.3 , Minneapolis at 3.0 , Tulsa, Oklahoma at 4.2 , Dallas-Fort Worth at 5.7 , Chicago at 3.9 , Atlanta at 3.9 , Phoenix at 4.9 , Denver at 6.0 and Charlotte, North Carolina at 5.3 . Our management will continue to monitor regional, national, and global economic indicators such as unemployment, GDP, housing starts and prices, consumer sentiment, commercial real estate price index and commercial real estate occupancy, absorption and rental rates, as these could significantly affect customers in each of our market area. COVID-19 Impact to Our Business and Response Great Southern continues to monitor and respond to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. As always, the health, safety and well-being of our customers, associates and communities, while maintaining uninterrupted service, are the Company s top priorities.

 COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor infection rates and other health and economic indicators to ensure we are prepared to respond to future challenges, should they arise. Paycheck Protection Program Loans Great Southern actively participated in the Paycheck Protection Program PPP through the SBA. In total, we originated approximately 3,250 PPP loans, totaling approximately 179 million. SBA forgiveness was approved and processed, and full repayment proceeds were received by us, for virtually all of these PPP loans during 2021 and early 2022. Great Southern received fees from the SBA for originating PPP loans based on the amount of each loan. At December 31, 2022, there were no material remaining net deferred fees related to PPP loans. The fees, net of origination costs, were deferred in accordance with standard accounting practices and accreted to interest income on loans over the contractual life of each loan. If loans are repaid prior to their contractual maturity date, remaining deferred fees are accreted to interest income at that time. In the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Great Southern recorded approximately 502,000 and 5.5 million, respectively, of net deferred fees in interest income on PPP loans. General The profitability of the Company and, more specifically, the profitability of its primary subsidiary, the Bank, depend primarily on its net interest income, as well as provisions for credit losses and the level of non-interest income and non-interest expense. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income the Bank earns on its loans and investment portfolios, and the interest it pays on interest-bearing liabilities, which consists mainly of interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on these balances. When interest-earning assets approximate or exceed interest-bearing liabilities, any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income. In the year ended December 31, 2022, Great Southern s total assets increased 230.8 million, or 4.2 , from 5.45 billion at December 31, 2021, to 5.68 billion at December 31, 2022. Full details of the current year changes in total assets are provided below, under Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Loans. In the year ended December 31, 2022, Great Southern s net loans increased 499.3 million, or 12.5 , from 4.01 billion at December 31, 2021, to 4.51 billion at December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily in one- to four-family residential loans, construction loans, other residential (multi-family) loans, and commercial real estate loans. As loan demand is affected by a variety of factors, including general economic conditions, and because of the competition we face and our focus on pricing discipline and credit quality, we cannot be assured that our loan growth will match or exceed the average level of growth achieved in prior years. The Company s strategy continues to be focused on maintaining credit risk and interest rate risk at appropriate levels. Recent growth has occurred in some loan types, primarily other residential (multi-family), commercial real estate and one- to four family residential real estate, and in most of Great Southern s primary lending locations, including Springfield, St. Louis, Kansas City, Des Moines and Minneapolis, as well as our loan production offices in Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Omaha, Phoenix and Tulsa. Certain minimum underwriting standards and monitoring help assure the Company s portfolio quality. Great Southern s loan committee reviews and approves all new loan originations in excess of lender approval authorities. Generally, the Company considers commercial construction, consumer, other residential (multi-family) and commercial real estate loans to involve a higher degree of risk compared to some other types of loans, such as first mortgage loans on one- to four-family, owner-occupied residential properties. For other residential (multi-family), commercial real estate, commercial business and construction loans, the credits are subject to an analysis of the borrower s and guarantor s financial condition, credit history, verification of liquid assets, collateral, market analysis and repayment ability. It has been, and continues to be, Great Southern s practice to verify information from potential borrowers regarding assets, income or payment ability and credit ratings as applicable and as required by the authority approving the loan. To minimize construction risk, projects are monitored as construction draws are requested by comparison to budget and with progress verified through property inspections. The geographic and product diversity of collateral, equity requirements and limitations on speculative construction projects help to mitigate overall risk in these loans. Underwriting standards for all loans also include loan-to-value ratio limitations which vary depending on collateral type, debt service coverage ratios or debt payment to income ratio guidelines, where applicable, credit histories, use of guaranties and other recommended terms relating to equity requirements, amortization, and maturity. Consumer loans, other than home equity loans, are primarily secured by new and used motor vehicles and

 these loans are also subject to certain minimum underwriting standards to assure portfolio quality. In 2019, the Company discontinued indirect auto loan originations. Of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 and 2021, 89.4 and 88.1 , respectively, was secured by real estate, as this is the Bank s primary focus in its lending efforts. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, commercial real estate and commercial construction loans were 50.8 and 52.6 of the Bank s total loan portfolio, respectively. Commercial real estate and commercial construction loans generally afford the Bank an opportunity to increase the yield on, and the proportion of interest rate sensitive loans in, its portfolio. They do, however, present somewhat greater risk to the Bank because they may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the economy generally. At December 31, 2022, loans made in the Springfield, Missouri metropolitan statistical area (Springfield MSA) comprised 7 of the Bank s total loan portfolio, compared to 8 at December 31, 2021. The Company s headquarters are located in Springfield and we have operated in this market since 1923. Loans made in the St. Louis metropolitan statistical area (St. Louis MSA) comprised 18 of the Bank s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2022, compared to 19 at December 31, 2021. The Company s expansion into the St. Louis MSA beginning in May 2009 has provided an opportunity to not only diversify from the Springfield MSA, but also has provided access to a larger economy with increased lending opportunities despite higher levels of competition. Loans made in the St. Louis MSA are primarily commercial real estate, commercial business and other residential (multi-family) loans, which are less likely to be impacted by the higher levels of unemployment rates, as mentioned above under Current Economic Conditions, than if the focus were on one- to four-family residential and consumer loans. For further discussions of the Bank s loan portfolio, and specifically, commercial real estate and commercial construction loans, see Item 1. Business Lending Activities. The percentage of fixed-rate loans in our loan portfolio has been as much as 44 in recent years and was 38 as of December 31, 2022. The majority of the increase in fixed rate loans over the past few years was in commercial real estate, which typically has short durations within our portfolio. Of the total amount of fixed rate loans in our portfolio as of December 31, 2022, approximately 78 mature within the next five years and therefore are not considered to create significant long-term interest rate risk for the Company. Fixed rate loans make up only a portion of our balance sheet and our overall interest rate risk strategy. As of December 31, 2022, our interest rate risk models indicated a one-year interest rate earnings sensitivity position that is moderately positive in an increasing rate environment. For further discussion of our interest rate sensitivity gap and the processes used to manage our exposure to interest rate risk, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk How We Measure the Risks to Us Associated with Interest Rate Changes. For discussion of the risk factors associated with interest rate changes, see Risk Factors We may be adversely affected by interest rate changes. While our policy allows us to lend up to 95 of the appraised value on one-to four-family residential properties, originations of loans with loan-to-value ratios at that level are minimal. Private mortgage insurance is typically required for loan amounts above the 80 level. Few exceptions occur and would be based on analyses which determined minimal transactional risk to be involved. We consider these lending practices to be consistent with or more conservative than what we believe to be the norm for banks our size. At December 31, 2022, 0.2 of our owner occupied one- to four-family residential loans had loan-to-value ratios above 100 at origination. At December 31, 2021, 0.3 of our owner occupied one- to four-family residential loans had loan-to-value ratios above 100 at origination. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, an estimated 0.2 and 0.2 , respectively, of total non-owner occupied one- to four-family residential loans had loan-to-value ratios above 100 at origination. At December 31, 2022, TDRs totaled 2.9 million, or 0.06 of total loans, a decrease of 902,000 from 3.9 million, or 0.1 of total loans, at December 31, 2021. Concessions granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties may include a reduction in the interest rate on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions intended to maximize collection. For TDRs occurring during the year ended December 31, 2022, none were restructured into multiple new loans. For TDRs occurring during the year ended December 31, 2021, one loan totaling 45,000 was restructured into multiple new loans. For further information on TDRs, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report. The level of non-performing loans and foreclosed assets affects our net interest income and net income. We generally do not accrue interest income on these loans and do not recognize interest income until the loans are repaid or interest payments have been made for a period of time sufficient to provide evidence of performance on the loans. Generally, the higher the level of non-performing assets, the greater the negative impact on interest income and net income.

 The Company continues its preparation for discontinuation of use of interest rates such as LIBOR. LIBOR is a benchmark interest rate referenced in a variety of agreements used by the Company, but by far the most significant area impacted by LIBOR is related to commercial and residential mortgage loans. After 2021, certain LIBOR rates may no longer be published and it is expected to eventually be discontinued as a reference rate by June 2023. Other interest rates used globally could be discontinued for similar reasons. The Company has been regularly monitoring its portfolio of loans tied to LIBOR since 2019, with specific groups of loans identified. The Company implemented LIBOR fallback language for all commercial loan transactions near the end of 2018, with such language utilized for all commercial loan originations and renewals/modifications since that time. The Company is monitoring the remaining group of loans that were originated prior to the fourth quarter of 2018, and have not been renewed or modified since that time. At December 31, 2022, this represented approximately 29 commercial loans totaling approximately 49 million; however, only 24 of those loans, totaling 40 million, mature after June 2023 (the date upon which the LIBOR indices used by the Company are expected to no longer be available). The Company also has a portfolio of residential mortgage loans tied to LIBOR indices with standard index replacement language included (approximately 359 million at December 31, 2022), and that portfolio is being monitored for potential changes that may be facilitated by the mortgage industry. The vast majority of the loan portfolio tied to LIBOR now includes LIBOR replacement language that identifies trigger events for the cessation of LIBOR and the steps that the Company will take upon the occurrence of one or more of those events, including adjustments to any rate margin to ensure that the replacement interest rate on the loan is substantially similar to the previous LIBOR-based rate. Available-for-sale Securities. In the year ended December 31, 2022, available-for-sale securities decreased 10.4 million, or 2.1 , from 501.0 million at December 31, 2021, to 490.6 million at December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to 226.5 million in available-for-sale securities being transferred to held-to-maturity during the year and calls of municipal securities and normal monthly payments received related to the portfolio of U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. In determining securities that were elected to be transferred to the held-to-maturity category, the Company reviewed all of its investment securities purchased prior to 2022 and determined that certain of those securities, for various reasons, would likely be held to their maturity or full repayment prior to contractual maturity. The decrease was mostly offset with purchases of U.S. Government agency fixed-rate single-family and multi-family mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. The Company used excess liquid funds and loan repayments to fund this increase in investment securities. For further information on investment securities, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report. Held-to-maturity Securities. In the year ended December 31, 2022, as noted above, available-for-sale securities of 226.5 million were transferred to held-to-maturity. This transfer included 220.2 million of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations and 6.3 million in municipal securities. At December 31, 2022 the balance of held-to-maturity securities was 202.5 million. Deposits. The Company attracts deposit accounts through its retail branch network, correspondent banking and corporate services areas, internet channels and brokered deposits. The Company then utilizes these deposit funds, along with FHLBank advances and other borrowings, to meet loan demand or otherwise fund its activities. In the year ended December 31, 2022, total deposit balances increased 132.8 million, or 2.9 . Transaction account balances decreased 338.9 million and retail certificates of deposit increased 127.6 million compared to December 31, 2021. The decrease in transaction accounts were primarily a result of decreased balances in non-interest accounts, money market deposit accounts and certain NOW account types. Balance decreases occurred in both individual and small business accounts, and appear to be the result of a partial runoff of pandemic deposits that increased significantly during 2020 and 2021. In addition, some accounts that carried higher balances may have chosen to move funds into different checking account types or time deposits that now have a higher rate of interest. Retail certificates of deposit increased due to retail certificates generated through the banking center network. Time deposits initiated through internet channels experienced a planned decrease as part of the Company s balance sheet management between funding sources. Brokered deposits, including IntraFi program purchased funds, were 411.5 million at December 31, 2022, an increase of 344.1 million from 67.4 million at December 31, 2021. The Company uses brokered deposits of select maturities from time to time to supplement its various funding channels and to manage interest rate risk. Our deposit balances may fluctuate depending on customer preferences and our relative need for funding. We do not consider our retail certificates of deposit to be guaranteed long-term funding because customers can withdraw their funds at any time with minimal interest penalty. When loan demand trends upward, we can increase rates paid on deposits to attract more deposits and utilize brokered deposits to provide additional funding. The level of competition for deposits in our markets is high. It is our goal to gain deposit 
 73 

Table of Contents 
 market share, particularly checking accounts, in our branch footprint. To accomplish this goal, increasing rates to attract deposits may be necessary, which could negatively impact the Company s net interest margin. Our ability to fund growth in future periods may also depend on our ability to continue to access brokered deposits and FHLBank advances. In times when our loan demand has outpaced our generation of new deposits, we have utilized brokered deposits and FHLBank advances to fund these loans. These funding sources have been attractive to us because we can create either fixed or variable rate funding, as desired, which more closely matches the interest rate nature of much of our loan portfolio. It also gives us greater flexibility in increasing or decreasing the duration of our funding. While we do not currently anticipate that our ability to access these sources will be reduced or eliminated in future periods, if this should happen, the limitation on our ability to fund additional loans could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Securities sold under reverse repurchase agreements with customers . Securities sold under reverse repurchase agreements with customers increased 39.7 million from 137.1 million at December 31, 2021 to 176.8 million at December 31, 2022. These balances fluctuate over time based on customer demand for this product. Federal Home Loan Bank Advances and Short Term Borrowings. The Company s FHLBank term advances were -0- at both December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022 there was 88.5 million in overnight borrowings from the FHLBank, which are included in short term borrowings. At December 31, 2021 there were no overnight borrowings from the FHLBank. Short term borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities increased 87.7 million from 1.8 million at December 31, 2021 to 89.6 million at December 31, 2022. The Company may utilize both overnight borrowings and short-term FHLBank advances depending on relative interest rates. Net Interest Income and Interest Rate Risk Management. Our net interest income may be affected positively or negatively by changes in market interest rates. A large portion of our loan portfolio is tied to one-month LIBOR or SOFR, three-month LIBOR or SOFR or the prime rate and adjusts immediately or shortly after the index rate adjusts (subject to the effect of contractual interest rate floors on some of the loans, which are discussed below). We monitor our sensitivity to interest rate changes on an ongoing basis (see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ). The current level and shape of the interest rate yield curve poses challenges for interest rate risk management. Prior to its increase of 0.25 on December 16, 2015, the FRB had last changed interest rates on December 16, 2008. This was the first rate increase since September 29, 2006. The FRB also implemented rate change increases of 0.25 on eight additional occasions beginning December 14, 2016 and through December 31, 2018, with the Federal Funds rate reaching as high as 2.50 . After December 2018, the FRB paused its rate increases and, in July, September and October 2019, implemented rate decreases of 0.25 on each of those occasions. At December 31, 2019, the Federal Funds rate was 1.75 . In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FRB decreased interest rates on two occasions in March 2020, a 0.50 decrease on March 3 and a 1.00 decrease on March 16. At December 31, 2021, the Federal Funds rate was 0.25 . In 2022, the FRB implemented rate increases of 0.25 , 0.50 , 0.75 , 0.75 , 0.75 , 0.75 and 0.50 in March, May, June, July, September, November and December 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2022, the Federal Funds rate was 4.50 , and currently is 4.75 . Financial markets expect further increases in Federal Funds interest rates in the first half of 2023, with 0.50-1.00 of additional cumulative rate hikes currently anticipated. A substantial portion of Great Southern s loan portfolio 958.8 million at December 31, 2022) is tied to the one-month or three-month LIBOR index and will be subject to adjustment at least once within 90 days after December 31, 2022. Of these loans, 958.4 million had interest rate floors. Great Southern s loan portfolio also includes loans 501.2 million at December 31, 2022) tied to various SOFR indexes that will be subject to adjustment at least once within 90 days after December 31, 2022. Of these loans, 501.2 million had interest rate floors. Great Southern also has a portfolio of loans 747.6 million at December 31, 2022) tied to a prime rate of interest that will adjust immediately or within 90 days of a change to the prime rate of interest. Of these loans, 734.6 million had interest rate floors at various rates. Great Southern also has a portfolio of loans 6.7 million at December 31, 2022) tied to an AMERIBOR index that will adjust immediately or within 90 days of a change to the prime rate of interest. All of these loans had interest rate floors at various rates. At December 31, 2022, nearly all of these LIBOR/SOFR and prime rate loans had fully-indexed rates that were at or above their floor rate and so are expected to move fully with future market interest rate increases. A rate cut by the FRB generally would have an anticipated immediate negative impact on the Company s net interest income due to the large total balance of loans tied to the one-month or three-month LIBOR index, SOFR indices or the prime rate index and will 
 74 

Table of Contents 
 be subject to adjustment at least once within 90 days or loans which generally adjust immediately as the Federal Funds rate adjusts. Interest rate floors may at least partially mitigate the negative impact of interest rate decreases. Loans at their floor rates are, however, subject to the risk that borrowers will seek to refinance elsewhere at the lower market rate. There may also be a negative impact on the Company s net interest income if the Company s is unable to significantly lower its funding costs due to a highly competitive rate environment, although interest rates on assets may decline further. Conversely, market interest rate increases would normally result in increased interest rates on our LIBOR-based, SOFR-based and prime-based loans. As of December 31, 2022, Great Southern s interest rate risk models indicate that, generally, rising interest rates are expected to have a positive impact on the Company s net interest income, while declining interest rates are expected to have a negative impact on net interest income. We model various interest rate scenarios for rising and falling rates, including both parallel and non-parallel shifts in rates. The results of our modeling indicate that net interest income is not likely to be significantly affected either positively or negatively in the first twelve months following relatively minor changes in market interest rates because our portfolios are relatively well-matched in a twelve-month horizon. In a situation where market interest rates increase significantly in a short period of time, our net interest margin increase may be more pronounced in the very near term (first one to three months), due to fairly rapid increases in LIBOR interest rates, SOFR interest rates and prime interest rates. In a situation where market interest rates decrease significantly in a short period of time, as they did in March 2020, our net interest margin decrease may be more pronounced in the very near term (first one to three months), due to fairly rapid decreases in LIBOR interest rates, SOFR interest rates and prime interest rates. In the subsequent months we expect that the net interest margin would stabilize and begin to improve, as renewal interest rates on maturing time deposits are expected to decrease compared to the current rates paid on those products. During 2020, we did experience some compression of our net interest margin percentage due to 2.25 of Federal Fund rate cuts during the nine month period of July 2019 through March 2020. Margin compression primarily resulted from changes in the asset mix, mainly the addition of lower-yielding assets and the issuance of subordinated notes during 2020 and the net interest margin remained lower than our historical average in 2021. LIBOR interest rates decreased significantly in 2020 and remained very low in 2021, putting pressure on loan yields, and strong pricing competition for loans and deposits remains in most of our markets. Beginning in March 2022, market interest rates, including LIBOR interest rates, SOFR interest rates and prime interest rates, began to increase rapidly. This has resulted in increasing loan yields and expansion of our net interest income and net interest margin in 2022. For further discussion of the processes used to manage our exposure to interest rate risk, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk How We Measure the Risks to Us Associated with Interest Rate Changes. Non-Interest Income and Operating Expenses. The Company s profitability is also affected by the level of its non-interest income and operating expenses. Non-interest income consists primarily of service charges and ATM fees, POS interchange fees, late charges and prepayment fees on loans, gains on sales of loans and available-for-sale investments and other general operating income. Operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy-related expenses, expenses related to foreclosed assets, postage, FDIC deposit insurance, advertising and public relations, telephone, professional fees, office expenses and other general operating expenses. Details of the current period changes in non-interest income and non-interest expense are provided under Results of Operations and Comparison for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Business Initiatives The Company s 92 banking centers and its loan production offices are consistently reviewed to measure performance and to ensure responsiveness to changing customer needs and preferences. As such, the Company may open banking centers and loan production offices and invest resources where customer demand leads, and from time to time, consolidate banking centers or even exit markets when conditions dictate. Several banking center changes were initiated in 2022 and are planned for 2023: In the St. Louis market, a low-transaction banking center inside an office building at 8235 Forsyth Boulevard in the Clayton area was consolidated into a nearby Brentwood-area office at 2435 S. Brentwood in August 2022. The commercial lending team continues to serve customers from the Clayton office location. Great Southern operates 17 banking centers in the St. Louis metro market. In Kimberling City, Missouri, a newly-constructed banking center opened in October 2022, replacing the former facility located on the same property at 14309 Highway 13. Including this office, the Company operates three banking centers in the Branson Tri-Lakes area of southwest Missouri.

Table of Contents 
 In Joplin, Missouri, a leased banking center at 1232 S. Rangeline Road is expected to be consolidated into a nearby office at 2801 E. 32 nd Street in March 2023. After this consolidation, the Company will operate one full-service office in Joplin. In Springfield, Missouri, a banking center located at 1615 West Sunshine Street was razed in early 2023 to make way for a new Express Center, utilizing only interactive teller machine (ITM) technology to serve customers. The modern four-lane drive-up center is expected to open during the third quarter of 2023 and will be the first-of-its-kind in the Springfield market. ITMs, also known as video remote tellers, offer an ATM-like interface, but with the enhancement of a video screen that allows customers to speak directly to a service representative in real time and in a highly personal manner. Nearly any teller transaction that can be performed in the traditional drive-thru can be performed at an ITM, including cashing a check to the penny. ITMs provide convenience and enhanced access for customers, while creating greater operational efficiencies for the Bank. 
 Commercial loan production offices (LPOs) continue to play a significant role in developing the commercial loan portfolio, providing a wide variety of the Bank s commercial lending services, including commercial real estate loans for new and existing properties and commercial construction loans. Two LPOs were opened in 2022: In February 2022, the Company opened an LPO in Phoenix. A local, highly experienced commercial lender was hired to develop commercial lending relationships in the Phoenix market area. In June 2022, an LPO was opened in Charlotte, North Carolina, and is managed by a local commercial lending veteran. 
 The Company now operates eight commercial LPOs, with other offices in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Omaha, Nebraska, and Tulsa, Oklahoma. Other corporate initiatives occurred in 2022 or are planned in 2023: In November 2022, the Company s Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program, which will succeed the existing repurchase program (authorized in January 2022) following the repurchase of the existing program s remaining available shares (approximately 177,000 shares as of December 31, 2022). The new stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date and authorizes the purchase, from time to time, of up to one million additional shares of the Company s common stock. To ensure the Company meets, or preferably exceeds, the expectations of our customers, it is imperative to have a modern and progressive information technology platform. In 2021, after a thorough evaluation of industry-leading core banking platforms and other information technology systems, the decision was made to replace the Company s current core banking system and ancillary software with a more modern, futuristic and long-term solution. Since the end of 2021, the Company has been heavily focused on preparing for the systems conversion. This upgrade in the operational platform is expected to provide customers with a superior banking experience, both in-person and digitally. Great Southern associates will also benefit with the use of new and advanced tools and better access to more meaningful information to serve our customers. In 2023, Great Southern Bank commemorates its 100 th anniversary of serving customers with activities throughout the year. The Bank was originally founded in 1923 with four employees and operated as a savings and loan association in Springfield. 
 Effect of Federal Laws and Regulations General. Federal legislation and regulation significantly affect the operations of the Company and the Bank, and have increased competition among commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking enterprises and other financial institutions. In particular, the capital requirements and operations of regulated banking organizations such as the Company and the Bank have been and will be subject to changes in applicable statutes and regulations from time to time, which changes could, under certain circumstances, adversely affect the Company or the Bank. Dodd-Frank Act. In 2010, sweeping financial regulatory reform legislation entitled the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act implemented far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape. Certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act have been affected by the more recently enacted Economic Growth Act, as defined and discussed below under -Economic Growth Act. 
 76 

Table of Contents 
 Capital Rules. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulatory capital rules that substantially amend the risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank and the Company. The rules implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Basel III refers to various documents released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. For the Company and the Bank, the general effective date of the rules was January 1, 2015, and, for certain provisions, various phase-in periods and later effective dates apply. The chief features of these rules are summarized below. The rules refine the definitions of what constitutes regulatory capital and add a new regulatory capital element, common equity Tier 1 capital. The minimum capital ratios are (i) a common equity Tier 1 CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5 ; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6 ; (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8 ; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4 . In addition to the minimum capital ratios, the rules include a capital conservation buffer, under which a banking organization must have CET1 more than 2.5 above each of its minimum risk-based capital ratios in order to avoid restrictions on paying dividends, repurchasing shares, and paying certain discretionary bonuses. The capital conservation buffer became fully implemented on January 1, 2019. These rules also revised the prompt corrective action framework, which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions if their capital levels show signs of weakness. Under the revised prompt corrective action requirements, insured depository institutions are required to meet the following in order to qualify as well capitalized: (i) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.5 , (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8 , (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10 and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5 , and must not be subject to an order, agreement or directive mandating a specific capital level. Economic Growth Act. In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the Economic Growth Act ), was enacted to modify or eliminate certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While the Economic Growth Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than 10 billion and for large banks with assets of more than 50 billion. Many of these amendments could result in meaningful regulatory changes. The Economic Growth Act, among other matters, expands the definition of qualified mortgages which may be held by a financial institution and simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than 10 billion by instructing the federal banking regulators to establish a single Community Bank Leverage Ratio CBLR of between 8 and 10 percent. Any qualifying depository institution or its holding company that exceeds the CBLR will be considered to have met generally applicable leverage and risk-based regulatory capital requirements and any qualifying depository institution that exceeds the new ratio will be considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action rules. Currently, the CBLR is 9.0 . The Company and the Bank have chosen to not utilize the new CBLR due to the Company s size and complexity, including its commercial real estate and construction lending concentrations and significant off-balance sheet funding commitments. In addition, the Economic Growth Act includes regulatory relief in the areas of examination cycles, call reports, mortgage disclosures and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 to the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report, for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and expected effects on the Company s financial position and results of operations. Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 During the year ended December 31, 2022, total assets increased by 230.8 million to 5.68 billion. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in loans receivable and held-to-maturity securities, partially offset by decreases in cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents were 168.5 million at December 31, 2022, a decrease of 548.7 million, or 76.5 , from 717.3 million at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2021, the cash equivalents primarily related to excess funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank. The additional funds were primarily the result of increases in net loan repayments throughout 2021. In 2022, these excess funds were used to purchase new investment securities and originate loans.

 The Company s available-for-sale securities decreased 10.4 million, or 2.1 , compared to December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily related to the transfer of 226.5 million in available-for-sale securities to held-to-maturity during 2022 and by calls of municipal securities and normal monthly payments received related to the portfolio of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. This decrease was mostly offset by the purchase of U.S. Government agency fixed-rate single-family or multi-family mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. The available-for-sale securities portfolio was 8.6 and 9.2 of total assets at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Held-to-maturity securities were 202.5 million at December 31, 2022. As indicated above, during the year ended December 31, 2022, 226.5 million in available-for-sale securities were transferred to held-to-maturity. This included 220.2 million of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations and 6.3 million in municipal securities. In determining securities that were elected to be transferred to the held-to-maturity category, the Company reviewed all of its investment securities purchased prior to 2022 and determined that certain of those securities, for various reasons, would likely be held to their maturity or full repayment prior to contractual maturity. The held-to-maturity securities portfolio was 3.6 of total assets at December 31, 2022. Net loans increased 499.3 million from December 31, 2021, to 4.51 billion at December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily in one- to four-family residential loans 222 million increase), construction loans 145 million increase), other residential (multi-family) loans 84 million increase) and commercial real estate loans 54 million increase). Loan origination volume in 2022 was similar to loan origination volume that occurred in 2020 and 2021; however, the pace of loan payoffs prior to maturity slowed in 2022 due to the increase in market rates of interest. Total liabilities increased 314.4 million from 4.83 billion at December 31, 2021 to 5.15 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to increases in short-term borrowings from FHLBank, increases in brokered deposits and increases in reverse repurchase agreements with customers. Total deposits increased 132.8 million, or 2.9 , from 4.55 billion at December 31, 2021 to 4.68 billion at December 31, 2022. Transaction account balances decreased 338.9 million, from 3.59 billion at December 31, 2021 to 3.25 billion at December 31, 2022. Retail certificates of deposit increased 127.6 million compared to December 31, 2021, to 1.02 billion at December 31, 2022. Decreases in transaction account balances were primarily due to decreases in IntraFi Network Reciprocal Deposits and non-interest-bearing checking accounts. Total interest-bearing checking and demand deposit accounts decreased 192.8 million and 146.2 million, respectively. Customer retail time deposits initiated through our banking center network increased 308.9 million and time deposits initiated through our national internet network decreased 151.9 million. The increase in customer retail time deposits initiated through the banking center network was primarily due to targeted promotions that started in late June 2022. Customer deposits at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 totaling 12.4 million and 41.7 million, respectively, were part of the IntraFi Network Deposits program, which allows customers to maintain balances in an insured manner that would otherwise exceed the FDIC deposit insurance limit. Brokered deposits increased 344.1 million to 411.5 million at December 31, 2022, compared to 67.4 million at December 31, 2021. Brokered deposits were utilized to fund growth in outstanding loans and to offset reductions in balances in other deposit categories. The Company has the capacity to further expand its use of brokered deposits if it chooses to do so. Of the total brokered deposits at December 31, 2022, 150.0 million were floating rate deposits which adjust daily based on the effective federal funds rate index. The Company s term Federal Home Loan Bank advances were -0- at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. At December 31, 2022 there were no borrowings from the FHLBank, other than overnight borrowings, which are included in the short term borrowings category. At December 31, 2021 there were no borrowings from the FHLBank. The Company may utilize both overnight borrowings and short-term FHLBank advances depending on relative interest rates. Short term borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities increased 87.7 million from 1.8 million at December 31, 2021 to 89.6 million at December 31, 2022. The short term borrowings included overnight FHLBank borrowings of 88.5 million at December 31, 2022. The short term borrowings included no overnight FHLBank borrowings at December 31, 2021. Securities sold under reverse repurchase agreements with customers increased 39.7 million, or 29.0 , from 137.1 million at December 31, 2021 to 176.8 million at December 31, 2022. These balances fluctuate over time based on customer demand for this product.

 Total stockholders equity decreased 83.7 million, from 616.8 million at December 31, 2021 to 533.1 million at December 31, 2022. The Company recorded net income of 75.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, total stockholders equity increased 7.7 million due to issuance of the Company s common stock upon stock option exercises. Total stockholders equity decreased 61.8 million due to repurchases of the Company s common stock. Accumulated other comprehensive income decreased 86.1 million due to decreases in the fair value of available-for-sale investment securities and the fair value of cash flow hedges, as a result of increased market interest rates. Dividends declared on common stock, which decreased total stockholders equity, were 19.3 million. Results of Operations and Comparison for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 General Net income increased 1.3 million, or 1.8 , during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Net income was 75.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 74.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of 21.7 million, or 12.2 , and a decrease in income tax expense of 1.5 million, or 7.5 , partially offset by an increase in provision for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments of 11.9 million, or 207.4 , an increase in non-interest expense of 5.7 million, or 4.5 , and a decrease in non-interest income of 4.2 million, or 10.9 . Total Interest Income Total interest income increased 28.3 million, or 14.2 , during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was due to a 19.5 million increase in interest income on loans and an 8.8 million increase in interest income on investment securities and other interest-earning assets. Interest income on loans increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to higher average rates of interest on loans and higher average loan balances. Interest income from investment securities and other interest-earning assets increased during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, due to higher average balances of investment securities combined with higher average rates of interest on investment securities and other interest-earning assets. Interest Income Loans During the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, interest income on loans increased due to higher average balances and average interest rates. Interest income increased 14.5 million as the result of higher average interest rates on loans. The average yield on loans increased from 4.36 during the year ended December 31, 2021 to 4.69 during the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the repricing of floating rates and the origination of new loans at current market rates in 2022 as market interest rates began to increase significantly. In addition, interest income on loans increased 5.0 million as a result of higher average loan balances, which increased from 4.27 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021, to 4.39 billion during the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company continued to originate loans at a pace similar to prior periods, but overall loan repayments slowed in 2022 compared to the level of repayments in 2021. Additionally, the Company s interest income on loans included accretion of net deferred fees related to PPP loans originated in 2020 and 2021. Net deferred fees recognized in interest income were 502,000 and 5.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. In October 2018, the Company entered into an interest rate swap transaction as part of its ongoing interest rate management strategies to hedge the risk of its floating rate loans. The notional amount of the swap was 400 million with a contractual termination date in October 2025. As previously disclosed by the Company, in March 2020, the Company and its swap counterparty mutually agreed to terminate this swap prior to its contractual maturity. The Company was paid 45.9 million from its swap counterparty as a result of this termination. This 45.9 million, less the accrued to date interest portion and net of deferred income taxes, is reflected in the Company s stockholders equity as Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and is being accreted to interest income on loans monthly through the original contractual termination date of October 6, 2025. This has the effect of reducing Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and increasing Net Interest Income and Retained Earnings over the periods. The Company recorded interest income related to the interest rate swap of 8.1 million in each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, the Company expected to have a sufficient amount of eligible variable rate loans to continue to accrete this

 interest income ratably in future periods. If this expectation changes and the amount of eligible variable rate loans decreases significantly, the Company may be required to recognize this interest income more rapidly. In March 2022, the Company entered into an interest rate swap transaction as part of its ongoing interest rate management strategies to hedge the risk of its floating rate loans. The notional amount of the swap is 300 million with a contractual termination date of March 1, 2024. Under the terms of the swap, the Company receives a fixed rate of interest of 1.6725 and pays a floating rate of interest equal to one-month USD-LIBOR (or the equivalent replacement rate if USD-LIBOR rate is not available). The floating rate resets monthly and net settlements of interest due to/from the counterparty also occur monthly. The initial floating rate of interest was set at 0.2414 . To the extent that the fixed rate of interest exceeds one-month USD-LIBOR, the Company will receive net interest settlements, which will be recorded as loan interest income. If one-month USD-LIBOR exceeds the fixed rate of interest, the Company will be required to pay net settlements to the counterparty and will record those net payments as a reduction of interest income on loans. The Company recorded a reduction of loan interest income related to this swap transaction of 941,000 in the year ended December 31, 2022. In July 2022, the Company entered into two additional interest rate swap transactions as part of its ongoing interest rate management strategies to hedge the risk of its floating rate loans. The notional amount of each swap is 200 million with an effective date of May 1, 2023 and a termination date of May 1, 2028. Under the terms of one swap, beginning in May 2023, the Company will receive a fixed rate of interest of 2.628 and will pay a floating rate of interest equal to one-month USD-SOFR OIS. Under the terms of the other swap, beginning in May 2023, the Company will receive a fixed rate of interest of 5.725 and will pay a floating rate of interest equal to one-month USD-Prime. In each case, the floating rate will be reset monthly and net settlements of interest due to/from the counterparty will also occur monthly. To the extent the fixed rate of interest exceeds the floating rate of interest, the Company will receive net interest settlements, which will be recorded as loan interest income. If the floating rate of interest exceeds the fixed rate of interest, the Company will be required to pay net settlements to the counterparty and will record those net payments as a reduction of interest income on loans. At December 31, 2022, the USD-Prime rate was 7.50 and the one-month USD-SOFR OIS rate was 4.06173 . Interest Income - Investments and Other Interest-earning Assets Interest income on investments increased 7.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Interest income increased 6.4 million as a result of an increase in average balances from 447.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, to 675.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. Interest income increased 1.1 million due to an increase in average interest rates from 2.61 during the year ended December 31, 2021 to 2.84 during the year ended December 31, 2022, due to higher market rates of interest on investment securities purchased during 2022 compared to securities already in the portfolio. At December 31, 2022, the investment portfolio did not include a material amount of adjustable rate securities. Interest income on other interest-earning assets increased 1.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Interest income increased 1.5 million as a result of higher average interest rates from 0.13 during the year ended December 31, 2021, to 1.05 during the year ended December 31, 2022. Interest income decreased 134,000 as a result of a decrease in average balances from 552.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, to 195.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in the average interest rate was primarily due to the increase in the rate paid on funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank. This rate was increased multiple times in 2022 in conjunction with the increase in the Federal Funds target interest rate. Total Interest Expense Total interest expense increased 6.6 million, or 31.9 , during the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared with the year ended December 31, 2021, due to an increase in interest expense on deposits of 7.6 million, or 57.8 , an increase in interest expense on short-term borrowings of 1.1 million, or 100.0 , an increase in interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts of 427,000, or 95.3 , and an increase in interest expense on securities sold under reverse repurchase agreements of 287,000, or 775.7 , partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on subordinated notes of 2.7 million, or 31.9 .

 Interest Expense - Deposits Interest expense on demand deposits increased 2.9 million due to an increase in average rates from 0.17 during the year ended December 31, 2021, to 0.30 during the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, interest on demand deposits increased 52,000 due to an increase in average balances from 2.32 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021, to 2.35 billion in the year ended December 31, 2022. Interest rates paid on demand deposits increased due to significant increases in the federal funds rate of interest and other market interest rates during 2022. Interest expense on time deposits increased 5.0 million as a result of an increase in average rates of interest from 0.78 during the year ended December 31, 2021, to 1.23 during the year ended December 31, 2022. Partially offsetting that increase, interest expense on time deposits decreased 316,000 due to a decrease in the average balance of time deposits from 1.16 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021, to 1.12 billion during the year ended December 31, 2022. A large portion of the Company s certificate of deposit portfolio matures within six to twelve months and therefore reprices fairly quickly; this is consistent with the portfolio over the past several years. Older certificates of deposit that renewed or were replaced with new deposits in the latter half of 2022 generally resulted in the Company paying a higher rate of interest due to market interest rate increases during 2022. The decrease in average balances of time deposits was a result of decreases in time deposits obtained through on-line channels. On-line channel time deposits were actively reduced by the Company as other deposit sources increased. The Company reduced its rates on these types of time deposits and allowed these deposits to mature without replacement during 2021 and 2022. Interest Expense - FHLBank Advances; Short-term Borrowings, Repurchase Agreements and Other Interest-bearing Liabilities; Subordinated Debentures Issued to Capital Trust and Subordinated Notes FHLBank term advances were not utilized during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. FHLBank overnight borrowings were utilized in 2022, but were not utilized in 2021. Interest expense on reverse repurchase agreements increased 290,000 due to an increase in average rates during the year ended December 31, 2022 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The average rate of interest was 0.24 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 0.03 during the year ended December 31, 2021. The average balance of repurchase agreements decreased 11.2 million from 143.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 to 132.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, resulting in little change in interest expense. Interest expense on short-term borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities increased 676,000 due to an increase in average balances from 1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, to 48.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, which was primarily due to changes in the Company s funding needs and the mix of funding, which can fluctuate. Most of this increase was due to the utilization of overnight borrowings from the FHLBank. In addition to this increase, interest expense on short-term borrowings, overnight FHLBank borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities increased 390,000 due to average rates that increased from 0.00 in the year ended December 31, 2021, to 2.20 in the year ended December 31, 2022.

 During the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts increased 427,000 due to higher average interest rates. The average interest rate was 1.74 in 2021, compared to 3.40 in 2022. The interest rate on the subordinated debentures is a floating rate indexed to the three-month LIBOR interest rate. There was no change in the average balance of the subordinated debentures between 2022 and 2021. In August 2016, the Company issued 75 million of 5.25 fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due August 15, 2026. The notes were sold at par, resulting in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions and other issuance costs, of approximately 73.5 million. In June 2020, the Company issued 75.0 million of 5.50 fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due June 15, 2030. The notes were sold at par, resulting in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions and other issuance costs, of approximately 73.5 million. In both cases, the issuance costs are amortized over the expected life of the notes, which is five years from the issuance date, and therefore impact the overall interest expense on the notes. In August 2021, the Company completed the redemption of all of its 5.25 subordinated notes due August 15, 2026. The notes were redeemed for cash by the Company at 100 of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest expense on subordinated notes decreased 2.7 million due to a decrease in average balances from 119.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 to 74.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, due to lower average balances resulting from the redemption of the subordinated notes maturing in 2026. Net Interest Income Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 21.7 million, or 12.2 , to 199.6 million, compared to 177.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net interest margin was 3.80 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 3.37 for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 43 basis points. The Company experienced increases in interest income on both loans and investment securities. The Company experienced increases in interest expense on deposits, short-term borrowings, subordinated debentures issued to capital trust and repurchase agreements, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on subordinated notes. The Company s overall interest rate spread increased 37 basis points, or 11.5 , from 3.22 during the year ended December 31, 2021, to 3.59 during the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was due to a 55 basis point increase in the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets and an 18 basis point increase in the weighted average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. In comparing the two years, the yield on loans increased 33 basis points, the yield on investment securities increased 23 basis points and the yield on other interest-earning assets increased 92 basis points. The rate paid on deposits increased 22 basis points, the rate paid on subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts increased 166 basis points, the rate paid on reverse repurchase agreements increased 21 basis points and the rate paid on subordinated notes decreased one basis point. In addition, the Company had outstanding overnight borrowings in the 2022 period, which had an average interest rate of 220 basis points compared to none in the 2021 period. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the mix of the Company s assets shifted somewhat, with net increases in outstanding loan balances and investment securities. The Company used excess funds that were previously held on account at the Federal Reserve Bank to fund the increases in loans and investments. Loans increased 499.3 million and investment securities increased 192.1 million, while cash and cash equivalents decreased 548.7 million. Also, in the latter half of 2022, the mix of deposits changed somewhat, with non-time account balances trending lower and time deposit balances trending higher. The increased time deposits are a mix of shorter-term retail deposits, fixed-rate brokered deposits callable at the Company s discretion and variable-rate brokered deposits. From time to time, the Company also utilized overnight borrowings from the FHLBank. For additional information on net interest income components, refer to the Average Balances, Interest Rates and Yields table in this Report. Provision for and Allowance for Credit Losses The Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , effective January 1, 2021. The CECL methodology replaced the incurred loss methodology with a lifetime expected credit loss measurement objective for loans, held-to-maturity debt securities and other receivables measured at amortized cost at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired. This standard requires the consideration of historical loss experience and current conditions adjusted for reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. Upon adoption of the CECL accounting standard, we increased the balance of our allowance for credit losses related to outstanding loans by 11.6 million and created a liability for potential losses related to the unfunded portion of our loans and commitments of approximately 8.7 million. The after-tax effect 
 82 

Table of Contents 
 reduced our retained earnings by approximately 14.2 million. The adjustment was based upon the Company s analysis of current conditions, assumptions and economic forecasts at January 1, 2021. Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term as well as for changes in economic conditions, such as changes in the national unemployment rate, commercial real estate price index, housing price index, consumer sentiment, gross domestic product (GDP) and construction spending. Worsening economic conditions from COVID-19 and subsequent variant outbreaks or similar events, higher inflation or interest rates, or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio and/or requirements for an increase in provision expense. Management maintains various controls in an attempt to identify and limit future losses, such as a watch list of problem loans and potential problem loans, documented loan administration policies and loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectability of the portfolio. Additional procedures provide for frequent management review of the loan portfolio based on loan size, loan type, delinquencies, financial analysis, on-going correspondence with borrowers and problem loan work-outs. Management determines which loans are collateral-dependent, evaluates risk of loss and makes additional provisions to expense, if necessary, to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a provision expense of 3.0 million on its portfolio of outstanding loans, compared to a negative provision of 6.7 million provision expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021. The negative provision for credit losses in 2021 reflected decreased outstanding total loans and continued positive trends in asset quality metrics, combined with an improved economic forecast. In 2021, the national unemployment rate continued to decrease and many measures of economic growth improved. The Company experienced net charge offs of 274,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to net recoveries of 116,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The provision for losses on unfunded commitments for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 3.2 million, compared to 939,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. General market conditions and unique circumstances related to specific industries and individual projects contributed to the level of provisions and charge-offs. Collateral and repayment evaluations of all assets categorized as potential problem loans, non-performing loans or foreclosed assets were completed with corresponding charge-offs or reserve allocations made as appropriate. The Bank s allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.39 and 1.49 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Management considers the allowance for credit losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the Bank s loan portfolio at December 31, 2022, based on recent reviews of the Bank s loan portfolio and current economic conditions. If challenging economic conditions were to last longer than anticipated or deteriorate further or management s assessment of the loan portfolio were to change, additional credit loss provisions could be required, thereby adversely affecting the Company s future results of operations and financial condition. Non-performing Assets As a result of changes in balances and composition of the loan portfolio, changes in economic and market conditions that occur from time to time, and other factors specific to a borrower s circumstances, the level of non-performing assets will fluctuate. Non-performing assets at December 31, 2022, were 3.7 million, a decrease of 2.3 million from 6.0 million at December 31, 2021. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.07 at December 31, 2022, compared to 0.11 at December 31, 2021. Compared to December 31, 2021, non-performing loans decreased 1.7 million to 3.7 million at December 31, 2022, and foreclosed assets decreased 538,000 to 50,000 at December 31, 2022. Non-performing commercial real estate loans were 1.6 million, or 43.0 , of total non-performing loans at December 31, 2022. Non-performing one-to four-family residential loans were 722,000, or 19.6 , of the total non-performing loans at December 31, 2022. Non-performing commercial business loans were 586,000, or 16.0 , of total non-performing loans at December 31, 2022. Non-performing land development loans were 384,000, or 10.5 , of total non-performing loans at December 31, 2022. Non-performing consumer loans were 399,000, or 10.9 , of the total non-performing loans at December 31, 2022.

The largest relationship in this category, which totaled 1.3 million, or 83.3 of the total category, was transferred from potential problem loans in 2021 and is collateralized by a mixed use commercial retail building. The non-performing one- to four-family residential category included 23 loans, four of which were added during 2022. The largest relationship in this category, totaled 158,000, or 21.8 of the total category. The non-performing land development category consisted of one loan, which totaled 384,000 and is collateralized by unimproved zoned vacant ground in southern Illinois. The non-performing commercial business category consisted of two loans that totaled 586,000 to a single borrower, both of which were added during the fourth quarter of 2022 and subsequently paid off with no loss in the first quarter of 2023. The non-performing consumer category included 23 loans, 11 of which were added during 2022. Other Real Estate Owned and Repossessions . Of the total 233,000 of other real estate owned and repossessions at December 31, 2022, 183,000 represents properties which were not acquired through foreclosure. Activity in foreclosed assets and repossessions during the year ended December 31, 2022, was as follows:

 The Company sold its three remaining foreclosed real estate properties in 2022. The additions and sales in the consumer category were due to the volume of repossessions of automobiles, which generally are subject to a shorter repossession process. Potential Problem Loans . Potential problem loans decreased 402,000 during the year ended December 31, 2022, from 2.0 million at December 31, 2021 to 1.6 million at December 31, 2022. Potential problem loans are loans which management has identified through routine internal review procedures as having possible credit problems that may cause the borrowers difficulty in complying with current repayment terms. These loans are not reflected in non-performing assets. Activity in the potential problem loans category during the year ended December 31, 2022, was as follows:

The largest relationship in this category totaled 159,000, or 11.8 of the total category. The consumer category of potential problem loans included 26 loans, 17 of which were added during the year ended December 31, 2022. Loans Classified Watch The Company reviews the credit quality of its loan portfolio using an internal grading system that classifies loans as Satisfactory, Watch, Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful. Loans classified as Watch are being monitored because of indications of potential weaknesses or deficiencies that may require future classification as special mention or substandard. In the year ended December 31, 2022, loans classified as Watch decreased 2.0 million, from 30.7 million at December 31, 2021 to 28.7 million at December 31, 2022 primarily due to loans being upgraded out of the Watch category, partially offset by loans being downgraded to the Watch category. See Note 3 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this report, for further discussion of the Company s loan grading system. Non-Interest Income Non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 34.1 million compared with 38.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease of 4.2 million, or 10.9 , was primarily as a result of the following items: Net gains on loan sales : Net gains on loan sales decreased 6.9 million compared to the prior year. The decrease was due to a decrease in originations of fixed-rate single-family mortgage loans during 2022 compared to 2021. Fixed rate single-family mortgage loans originated are generally subsequently sold in the secondary market. These loan originations increased substantially when market interest rates decreased to historically low levels in 2020 and 2021. As a result of the significant volume of refinance activity in 2020

Table of Contents 
 and 2021, and as market interest rates moved higher beginning in the second quarter of 2022, mortgage refinance volume has decreased and fixed rate loan originations and related gains on sales of these loans have decreased substantially. The lower level of originations is expected to continue as long as market rates remain elevated. Other income : Other income increased 1.3 million compared to the prior year. In 2022, a gain of 1.0 million was recognized on sales of fixed assets. Also in 2022, the Company recorded a one-time bonus of 500,000 from its card processor for achieving certain benchmarks related to debit card activity. Overdraft and Insufficient funds fees : Overdraft and Insufficient funds fees increased 1.2 million compared to the prior year. It appears that consumers continued to spend significantly in 2022, but some may have lower account balances as prices for goods and services have increased and government stimulus payments received by consumers in 2020 and 2021 have been exhausted now. Point-of-sale and ATM fees : Point-of-sale and ATM fees increased 676,000 compared to the prior year. This increase was mainly due to increased customer debit card transactions in 2022 compared to 2021. In the latter half of 2021 and through 2022, debit card usage by customers rebounded and was back to historical levels, and in many cases, increased levels of activity. However, during the three months ended December 31, 2022, debit card usage and revenue to Great Southern decreased a bit compared to recent quarterly periods. It appears that debit card transaction volumes may have decreased and customers may be using credit cards for more transactions instead. Non-Interest Expense Total non-interest expense increased 5.7 million, or 4.5 , from 127.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, to 133.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company s efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 57.05 , compared to 59.03 for 2021. The higher efficiency ratio in 2021 was primarily due to an increase in non-interest expense (primarily from the significant IT consulting expense and related contract termination liability incurred in December 2021), partially offset by an increase in total revenue. Excluding this consulting expense and contract termination liability, the Company s efficiency ratio was 56.57 in 2021. In the year ended December 31, 2022, the improvement in the efficiency ratio was primarily due to an increase in net interest income, as a result of increased loan and investment balances and increased market interest rates compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by increased non-interest expense. The Company s ratio of non-interest expense to average assets was 2.42 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2.32 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Average assets for the year ended December 31, 2022, increased 17.4 million, or 0.3 , from the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to increases in net loans receivable and investment securities, partially offset by a decrease interest-bearing cash equivalents. The following were key items related to the increase in non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021: Salaries and employee benefits : Salaries and employee benefits increased 5.0 million from the prior year. A portion of this increase related to normal annual merit increases in various lending and operations areas. In 2022, many of these increases were larger than in previous years due to the current employment environment. Also, in the second quarter of 2022, the Company paid a special cash bonus to all employees totaling 1.1 million in response to the rapid and significant increases in prices for many goods and services. In addition, the Phoenix and Charlotte, North Carolina loan offices were opened in 2022, with the operation of these offices adding approximately 727,000 of salaries and benefits expense in the 2022 year. Other operating expenses : Other operating expenses increased 1.7 million from the prior year, to 8.3 million. Of this increase, 443,000 related to deposit account fraud losses and 219,000 related to charitable contributions. Provision for Income Taxes For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company s effective tax rate was 19.4 and 20.9 , respectively. These effective rates were at or below the statutory federal tax rate of 21 , due primarily to the utilization of certain investment tax credits and the Company s tax-exempt investments and tax-exempt loans, which reduced the Company s effective tax rate. The Company s effective tax rate may fluctuate in future periods as it is impacted by the level and timing of the Company s utilization of tax credits, the level of tax-exempt investments and loans, the amount of taxable income in various state jurisdictions and the overall level of pre-tax income. State tax expense estimates continually evolve as taxable income and apportionment between states is analyzed. Upon

 filing its federal and various state income tax returns for 2021 in the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company updated its combined tax rate applied to deferred tax items and also adjusted its current income taxes receivable/payable balances as a result of carryback claims. These adjustments to current and deferred taxes resulted in a reduction in income tax expense of 1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.The Company s effective income tax rate is currently generally expected to remain near the statutory federal tax rate due primarily to the factors noted above. The Company currently expects its effective tax rate (combined federal and state) will be approximately 20.5 to 21.5 in future periods. Average Balances, Interest Rates and Yields The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest-earning assets and the resulting yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, expressed both in dollars and rates, and the net interest margin. Average balances of loans receivable include the average balances of non-accrual loans for each period. Interest income on loans includes interest received on non-accrual loans on a cash basis. Interest income on loans includes the amortization of net loan fees, which were deferred in accordance with accounting standards. Net fees included in interest income were 6.3 million, 11.2 million and 6.6 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Tax-exempt income was not calculated on a tax equivalent basis. The table does not reflect any effect of income taxes.

 (1) Of the total average balance of investment securities, average tax-exempt investment securities were 54.0 million, 42.3 million and 55.9 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, average tax-exempt industrial revenue bonds were 16.4 million, 17.9 million and 20.0 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Interest income on tax-exempt assets included in this table was 2.2 million, 1.6 million and 2.2 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Interest income net of disallowed interest expense related to tax-exempt assets was 2.1 million, 1.6 million and 2.0 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Rate/Volume Analysis The following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the periods shown. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in rate (i.e., changes in rate multiplied by old volume) and (ii) changes in volume (i.e., changes in volume multiplied by old rate). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately to volume and rate. Tax-exempt income was not calculated on a tax equivalent basis.

Net income was 74.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 59.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was due to a decrease in provision (credit) for credit losses and unfunded commitments of 21.6 million, or 136.3 , an increase in non-interest income of 3.3 million, or 9.3 , and an increase in net interest income of 783,000, or 0.4 , partially offset by an increase in income tax expenses of 6.0 million, or 43.2 , and an increase in non-interest expenses of 4.4 million, or 3.6 . Total Interest Income Total interest income decreased 19.0 million, or 8.7 , during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was due to an 18.7 million, or 9.1 , decrease in interest income on loans and a 335,000, or 2.6 , decrease in interest income on investment securities and other interest-earning assets. Interest income on loans decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to lower average rates of interest and lower average balances of loans. Interest income from investment securities and other interest-earning assets decreased during 2021 compared to 2020 due to lower average rates of interest, partially offset by higher average balances of investments and other interest-earning assets.

 Interest Income Loans During the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, interest income on loans decreased due to lower average balances and lower average interest rates. Interest income decreased 13.0 million as the result of lower average interest rates on loans. The average yield on loans decreased from 4.66 during the year ended December 31, 2020 to 4.36 during the year ended December 31, 2021. The decreased yields in most loan categories were primarily a result of decreased LIBOR and Federal Funds interest rates. In addition, interest income on loans decreased 5.7 million as a result of lower average loan balances, which decreased from 4.40 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020, to 4.27 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021. The lower average balances were primarily due to higher loan repayments during 2021. In 2020, the Company also originated 121 million of PPP loans, which have a much lower yield compared to the overall loan portfolio. These loans were largely repaid during 2021, contributing to the lower average balance in loans. On an on-going basis, the Company has estimated the cash flows expected to be collected from the FDIC-assisted acquired loan pools. For each of the loan portfolios acquired, the cash flow estimates have increased, based on the payment histories and the collection of certain loans, thereby reducing loss expectations of certain loan pools, resulting in adjustments to be spread on a level-yield basis over the remaining expected lives of the loan pools. The entire amount of the discount adjustment has been and will be accreted to interest income over time. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the adjustments increased interest income and pre-tax income by 1.6 million and 5.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining accretable yield adjustment that will affect interest income was 429,000. We recognized the remaining 429,000 of interest income during 2022. We adopted the new accounting standard related to accounting for credit losses as of January 1, 2021. With the adoption of this standard, there is no reclassification of discounts from non-accretable to accretable subsequent to December 31, 2020. All adjustments made prior to December 31, 2020 will continue to be accreted to interest income. Apart from the yield accretion, the average yield on loans was 4.32 during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 4.53 during the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of lower current market rates on adjustable rate loans and new loans originated during the year. In October 2018, the Company entered into an interest rate swap transaction as part of its ongoing interest rate management strategies to hedge the risk of its floating rate loans. The notional amount of the swap was 400 million with a termination date of October 6, 2025. Under the terms of the swap, the Company received a fixed rate of interest of 3.018 and paid a floating rate of interest equal to one-month USD-LIBOR. The floating rate was reset monthly and net settlements of interest due to/from the counterparty also occurred monthly. To the extent that the fixed rate of interest exceeded one-month USD-LIBOR, the Company received net interest settlements which were recorded as loan interest income. If USD-LIBOR exceeded the fixed rate of interest, the Company was required to pay net settlements to the counterparty and record those net payments as a reduction of interest income on loans. In March 2020, the Company and its swap counterparty mutually agreed to terminate the 400 million interest rate swap prior to its contractual maturity. The Company received a payment of 45.9 million from its swap counterparty as a result of this termination. This 45.9 million, less the accrued interest portion and net of deferred income taxes, is reflected in the Company s stockholders equity as Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and a portion of it will be accreted to interest income on loans monthly through the original contractual termination date of October 6, 2025. This has the effect of reducing Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and increasing Net Interest Income and Retained Earnings over the period. The Company recorded loan interest income of 8.1 million and 7.7 million during the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to this interest rate swap. The Company currently expects to have a sufficient amount of eligible variable rate loans to continue to accrete this interest income in future periods. If this expectation changes and the amount of eligible variable rate loans decreases significantly, the Company may be required to recognize this interest income more rapidly. Interest Income Investments and Other Interest-earning Assets Interest income on investments decreased 573,000 in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest income decreased 1.2 million due to a decrease in average interest rates from 2.88 during the year ended December 31, 2020 to 2.61 during the year ended December 31, 2021, due to lower market rates of interest on investment securities purchased during 2021 compared to securities already in the portfolio. Interest income increased 600,000 as a result of an increase in average balances from 426.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, to 447.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.

 Interest income on other interest-earning assets increased 238,000 in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest income increased 438,000 as a result of an increase in average balances from 246.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, to 552.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. Average balances increased due to higher balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of the significant increase in deposits since March 31, 2020 and significant loan repayments in 2021. Interest income decreased 200,000 due to a decrease in average interest rates from 0.19 during the year ended December 31, 2020, to 0.13 during the year ended December 31, 2021. Market interest rates earned on balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank were significantly lower in 2020 due to significant reductions in the federal funds rate of interest and remained low in 2021. Total Interest Expense Total interest expense decreased 19.8 million, or 48.8 , during the year ended December 31, 2021, when compared with the year ended December 31, 2020, due to a decrease in interest expense on deposits of 19.3 million, or 59.6 , a decrease in interest expense on short-term borrowings and repurchase agreements of 638,000, or 94.5 , and a decrease in interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust of 180,000, or 28.7 . Partially offsetting these decreases, interest expense on subordinated notes increased 334,000, or 4.9 . Interest Expense Deposits Interest expense on demand deposits decreased 4.5 million due to a decrease in average rates from 0.38 during the year ended December 31, 2020, to 0.17 during the year ended December 31, 2021. Partially offsetting that decrease, interest on demand deposits increased 1.4 million due to an increase in average balances from 1.87 billion in the year ended December 31, 2020, to 2.32 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in average interest rates of interest-bearing demand deposits was primarily a result of decreased market interest rates on these types of accounts. Demand deposit balances increased substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and remained elevated during 2021. In 2020, many of our business and personal customers increased their average account balances with us (some through funds received from government entities) and we also added new accounts throughout the year. Much of these increased balances remained or grew in 2021; therefore, the average balances were higher in 2021 versus 2020. Interest expense on time deposits decreased 10.3 million as a result of a decrease in average rates of interest from 1.55 during the year ended December 31, 2020, to 0.78 during the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, interest expense on time deposits decreased 6.0 million due to a decrease in average balance of time deposits from 1.64 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020, to 1.16 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021. A large portion of the Company s certificate of deposit portfolio matures within six to twelve months and therefore reprices fairly quickly; this is consistent with the portfolio over the past several years. Older certificates of deposit that renewed or were replaced with new deposits generally resulted in the Company paying a lower rate of interest due to market interest rate decreases during 2020 and 2021. The decrease in average balances of time deposits was a result of decreases in retail customer time deposits obtained through the banking center network, retail customer time deposits obtained through on-line channels and decreases in brokered deposits. Brokered and on-line channel deposits were actively reduced by the Company as other deposit sources increased. The Company reduced its rates on these types of time deposits and allowed these deposits to mature without replacement during 2021. Interest Expense - FHLBank Advances, Short-term Borrowings, Repurchase Agreements and Other Interest-bearing Liabilities; Subordinated Debentures Issued to Capital Trust and Subordinated Notes FHLBank term advances were not utilized during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. FHLBank overnight borrowings were utilized in the first quarter of 2020. Interest expense on repurchase agreements increased 6,000 due to an increase in average balances from 140.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, to 143.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in average balances was due to changes in customers need for this product, which can fluctuate. There was only a very minor change in the average interest rate on the repurchase agreements between 2021 and 2020. Interest expense on short-term borrowings, overnight FHLBank borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities decreased 326,000 due to average rates that decreased from 1.51 in the year ended December 31, 2020, to 0.02 in the year ended December 31, 2021.

 In addition to this decrease, interest expense on short-term borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities decreased 318,000 due to a decrease in average balances from 42.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, to 1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in average balances and rates was due to changes in the Company s funding needs and the mix of funding, which can fluctuate. During the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts decreased 180,000 due to lower average interest rates. The average interest rate was 2.44 in 2020, compared to 1.74 in 2021. The interest rate on subordinated debentures is a floating rate indexed to the three-month LIBOR interest rate. There was no change in the average balance of the subordinated debentures between 2021 and 2020. In August 2016, the Company issued 75 million of 5.25 fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due August 15, 2026. The notes were sold at par, resulting in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions and other issuance costs, of approximately 73.5 million. In June 2020, the Company issued 75.0 million of 5.50 fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due June 15, 2030. The notes were sold at par, resulting in net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions and other issuance costs, of approximately 73.5 million. In both cases, the issuance costs are amortized over the expected life of the notes, which is five years from the issuance date, and therefore impact the overall interest expense on the notes. In August 2021, the Company completed the redemption of all of its 5.25 subordinated notes due August 15, 2026. The notes were redeemed for cash by the Company at 100 of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest expense on subordinated notes increased 265,000 due to an increase in average balances from 115.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 to 119.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 due to higher average balances resulting from the issuance of new notes in June 2020, slightly offset by the redemption of the subordinated notes maturing in 2026 during August 2021. Interest expense on the subordinated notes increased 69,000 due to average rates that increased from 5.92 in the year ended December 31, 2020, to 5.98 in the year ended December 31, 2021. Net Interest Income Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased 783,000, or 0.4 , to 177.9 million, compared to 177.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net interest margin was 3.37 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 3.49 for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of 12 basis points. In both years, the Company s net interest income and margin were positively impacted by the increases in expected cash flows from the FDIC-assisted acquired loan pools and the resulting increase to accretable yield, which was discussed previously in Interest Income Loans and is discussed in Note 3 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report. The positive impact of these changes on the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were increases in interest income of 1.6 million and 5.6 million, respectively, and increases in net interest margin of three basis points and 11 basis points, respectively. Excluding the positive impact of the additional yield accretion, net interest margin decreased four basis points during the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net interest margin was due to significantly declining market interest rates, a change in asset mix with increases in lower-yielding investments and cash equivalents and the redemption of subordinated notes in 2021. The Company s overall interest rate spread decreased one basis point, or 0.5 , from 3.23 during the year ended December 31, 2020, to 3.22 during the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was due to a 52 basis point decrease in the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets, partially offset by a 51 basis point decrease in the weighted average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. In comparing the two years, the yield on loans decreased 30 basis points, the yield on investment securities decreased 27 basis points and the yield on other interest-earning assets decreased six basis points. The rate paid on deposits decreased 55 basis points, the rate paid on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust decreased 70 basis points, the rate paid on short-term borrowings decreased 34 basis points, and the rate paid on subordinated notes increased six basis points. For additional information on net interest income components, refer to the Average Balances, Interest Rates and Yields table in this Report. Provision for and Allowance for Credit Losses During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a negative provision expense of 6.7 million on its portfolio of outstanding loans, compared to a 15.9 million provision expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020. The negative provision for credit losses in 2021 reflected decreased outstanding total loans and continued positive trends in asset quality metrics,

 combined with an improved economic forecast. In 2021, the national unemployment rate continued to decrease and many measures of economic growth improved. The Company experienced net recoveries of 116,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to net charge offs of 422,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The provision for losses on unfunded commitments for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 939,000. General market conditions and unique circumstances related to specific industries and individual projects contributed to the level of provisions and charge-offs. Collateral and repayment evaluations of all assets categorized as potential problem loans, non-performing loans or foreclosed assets were completed with corresponding charge-offs or reserve allocations made as appropriate. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on the overall economy and unemployment, the Company increased its provision for credit losses and increased its allowance for credit losses, even though actual realized net charge-offs were very low. The Bank s allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.49 and 1.32 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Prior to January 1, 2021, the ratio excluded the FDIC-assisted acquired loans. Non-performing Assets Prior to adoption of the CECL accounting standard on January 1, 2021, FDIC-assisted acquired non-performing assets, including foreclosed assets and potential problem loans, were not included in the totals or in the discussion of non-performing loans, potential problem loans and foreclosed assets. These assets were initially recorded at their estimated fair values as of their acquisition dates and accounted for in pools. The loan pools were analyzed rather than the individual loans. The performance of the loan pools acquired in each of the Company s five FDIC-assisted transactions has been better than expectations as of the acquisition dates; as a result, FDIC-assisted acquired assets are included in their particular collateral categories in the tables below and then the total FDIC-assisted acquired assets are subtracted from the total balances. Non-performing assets, including all FDIC-assisted acquired assets, at December 31, 2021, were 6.0 million, a decrease of 2.1 million from 8.1 million at December 31, 2020. Non-performing assets, including all FDIC-assisted acquired assets, as a percentage of total assets were 0.11 at December 31, 2021, compared to 0.15 at December 31, 2020. Compared to December 31, 2020, non-performing loans decreased 1.5 million to 5.4 million at December 31, 2021, and foreclosed assets decreased 635,000 to 588,000 at December 31, 2021. Non-performing one-to four-family residential loans comprised 2.2 million, or 40.9 , of the total non-performing loans at December 31, 2021. Non-performing commercial real estate loans comprised 2.0 million, or 37.0 , of total non-performing loans at December 31, 2021. Non-performing consumer loans comprised 733,000, or 13.5 , of the total non-performing loans at December 31, 2021. Non-performing land development loans comprised 468,000, or 8.6 , of total non-performing loans at December 31, 2021. Non-performing Loans . Activity in the non-performing loans category during the year ended December 31, 2021, was as follows:

The largest relationship in this category is an FDIC-assisted acquired loan totaling 326,000, or 14.7 of the total category. The non-performing commercial real estate category included two loans, both of which were added during 2021. The largest relationship in this category, which totaled 1.7 million, or 86.0 of the total category, was transferred from potential problems and is collateralized by a mixed use commercial retail building. The previous largest non-performing commercial real estate relationship 2.4 million) was paid off in 2021. The non-performing consumer category included 30 loans, seven of which were added during 2021. The non-performing land development category consisted of one loan added during 2021, which totaled 468,000 and is collateralized by unimproved zoned vacant ground in southern Illinois. Loans that were modified under the guidance provided by the CARES Act are not included as non-performing loans in the table above as they were current under their modified terms. Other Real Estate Owned and Repossessions . Of the total 2.1 million of other real estate owned and repossessions at December 31, 2021, 1.5 million represents properties which were not acquired through foreclosure. Activity in foreclosed assets and repossessions during the year ended December 31, 2021, was as follows:

The one- to four-family residential category of foreclosed assets consisted of two properties (both of which were FDIC-assisted acquired assets), both of which were added during 2021. The amount of additions and sales in the consumer category are due to the volume of repossessions of automobiles, which generally are subject to a shorter repossession process. Potential Problem Loans . Potential problem loans decreased 3.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, from 5.8 million at December 31, 2020 to 2.0 million at December 31, 2021. As noted, we experienced an increased level of loan modifications in late March through June 2020; however, total loan modifications were much lower at December 31, 2020, and decreased further through December 31, 2021. In accordance with the CARES Act and guidance from the banking regulatory agencies, we made certain short-term modifications to loan terms to help our customers navigate through the pandemic situation. Although loan modifications were made, they did not automatically result in these loans being classified as TDRs, potential problem loans or non-performing loans.

During 2021, within the commercial real estate category of potential problem loans, one at 536,000 was upgraded after six months of consecutive payments and one at 534,000 was paid off and removed from the potential problem loans category; both of these loans had been added to potential problem loans in 2020. One loan totaling 1.7 million was moved to the non-performing category. The one- to four-family residential category of potential problem loans included 25 loans, none of which were added during 2021. The largest relationship in this category totaled 171,000, or 12.0 of the category. The consumer category of potential problem loans included 27 loans, eight of which were added during 2021. Loans Classified Watch The Company reviews the credit quality of its loan portfolio using an internal grading system that classifies loans as Satisfactory, Watch, Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful. Loans classified as Watch are being monitored because of indications of potential weaknesses or deficiencies that may require future classification as special mention or substandard. During 2021, loans classified as Watch decreased 34.0 million, from 64.8 million at December 31, 2020 to 30.7 million at December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to loans being upgraded out of the watch category, which primarily included one 14.3 million relationship collateralized by a shopping center, one 10.6 million relationship collateralized by recreational facilities and other real estate and business assets, and one 3.9 million relationship collateralized by a shopping center and other real estate and business assets. Also, one 11.6 million relationship collateralized by a healthcare facility was paid in full during 2021. Partially offsetting those decreases, one 10.3 million relationship collateralized by a healthcare facility was downgraded and added to the Watch category. See Note 3 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this report, for further discussion of the Company s loan grading system. Non-Interest Income Non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 38.3 million compared with 35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of 3.3 million, or 9.3 , was primarily as a result of the following items: Point-of-sale and ATM fees : Point-of-sale and ATM fees increased 2.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to a reduction in customer usage in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic caused many businesses to close or limit access for a period of time. In the year ended December 31, 2021, debit card and ATM usage by customers was back to normal levels, and in some cases, increased levels of activity.

 Net gains on loan sales : Net gains on loan sales increased 1.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to an increase in originations of fixed-rate single-family mortgage loans during 2021 compared to 2020. Fixed-rate single-family mortgage loans originated are generally subsequently sold in the secondary market. These loan originations increased substantially when market interest rates decreased to historically low levels in the latter half of 2020 and the first half of 2021. As a result of the significant volume of refinance activity, and as market interest rates moved a bit higher in the latter half of 2021, mortgage refinance volume decreased and loan originations and related gains on sales of these loans returned to levels closer to historic averages. Gain (loss) on derivative interest rate products : In 2021, the Company recognized a gain of 312,000 on the change in fair value of its back-to-back interest rate swaps related to commercial loans. In 2020, the Company recognized a loss of 264,000 on the change in fair value of its back-to-back interest rate swaps related to commercial loans. Generally, as market interest rates increase, this creates a net increase in the fair value of these instruments. As market rates decrease, the opposite tends to occur. This is a non-cash item as there was no required settlement of this amount between the Company and its swap counterparties. Other income: Other income decreased 2.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2020, the Company recognized approximately 1.5 million of fee income related to newly-originated interest rate swaps in the Company s back-to-back swap program with loan customers and swap counterparties, with fewer of these transactions and related fee income generated in 2021. Non-Interest Expense Total non-interest expense increased 4.4 million, or 3.6 , from 123.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, to 127.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company s efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 59.03 , an increase from 58.07 for 2020. The higher efficiency ratio in 2021 was primarily due to an increase in non-interest expense (primarily from the significant IT consulting expense and related contract termination liability incurred in December 2021), partially offset by an increase in total revenue. Excluding this consulting expense and contract termination liability, the Company s efficiency ratio was 56.57 in 2021. In the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company s efficiency ratio was negatively impacted by a decrease in interest income on loans and positively impacted by a decrease in interest expense on deposits. In the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company s efficiency ratio was negatively impacted by an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense and positively impacted by an increase in income related to loan sales. The Company s ratio of non-interest expense to average assets was 2.32 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2.31 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Average assets for the year ended December 31, 2021, increased 178.9 million, or 3.4 , from the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to increases in investment securities and interest-bearing cash equivalents, partially offset by a decrease in net loans receivable. The following were key items related to the increase in non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020: Legal, Audit and Other Professional Fees : Legal, audit and other professional fees increased 4.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2021, the Company expensed and paid 4.1 million in fees to consultants that were engaged to support the Company in its evaluation of core and ancillary software and information technology systems. The consultant s support included assisting the Company in identifying various software options, helping identify positive and negative attributes of those software options and assisting in negotiating contract terms and pricing. Net Occupancy and Equipment Expense : Net occupancy and Equipment expense increased 1.6 million, to 29.2 million at December 31, 2021 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2021, the Company expensed a 1.2 million contract termination fee related to the Company s current core software and information technology system. Insurance : Insurance expense increased 656,000 in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to an increase in FDIC deposit insurance premiums. In 2020, the Company had a 482,000 credit with the FDIC for a portion of premiums previously paid to the deposit insurance fund. The remaining deposit insurance fund credit was utilized in 2020 in addition to 870,000 in premiums being due for the year ended December 31, 2020, while the premium expense was 1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

 Expense on other real estate owned and repossessions : Expense on other real estate owned and repossessions decreased 1.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to sales of most foreclosed assets and a smaller amount of repossessed automobiles in 2021, plus higher valuation write-downs of certain foreclosed assets during 2020. During 2020, sales and valuation write-downs of certain foreclosed assets totaled a net expense of 963,000, while sales and valuation write-downs in 2021 totaled a net gain of 7,000. Salaries and employee benefits : Salaries and employee benefits decreased 520,000 in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2020, the Company approved two special cash bonuses to all employees totaling 2.2 million in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such bonuses were not repeated in the year ended December 31, 2021. Provision for Income Taxes For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company s effective tax rates were 20.9 and 18.9 , respectively. These effective rates were at or below the statutory federal tax rate of 21 , due primarily to the utilization of certain investment tax credits and to tax-exempt investments and tax-exempt loans, which reduced the Company s effective tax rate. Liquidity Liquidity is a measure of the Company s ability to generate sufficient cash to meet present and future financial obligations in a timely manner through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management. These obligations include the credit needs of customers, funding deposit withdrawals, and the day-to-day operations of the Company. Liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits with financial institutions and certain investment securities and loans. As a result of the Company s management of the ability to generate liquidity primarily through liability funding, management believes that the Company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and meet its borrowers credit needs. At December 31, 2022, the Company had commitments of approximately 114.0 million to fund loan originations, 2.01 billion of unused lines of credit and unadvanced loans, and 16.7 million of outstanding letters of credit. Loan commitments and the unfunded portion of loans at the dates indicated were as follows (in thousands):

The Company utilizes particular sources of funds based on the comparative costs and availability at the time. The Company has from time to time chosen not to pay rates on deposits as high as the rates paid by certain of its competitors and, when believed to be appropriate, supplements deposits with less expensive alternative sources of funds. Since mid-2022, the Company has increased the interest rates it pays on many deposit products. The Company has also utilized both fixed-rate and floating-rate brokered deposits of varying terms, as well as overnight FHLBank borrowings. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had these available secured lines and on-balance sheet liquidity: 

December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Federal Home Loan Bank line 1,005.1 million 756.5 million Federal Reserve Bank line 397.0 million 352.4 million Cash and cash equivalents 168.5 million 717.3 million Unpledged securities Available-for-sale 371.8 million 406.8 million Unpledged securities Held-to-maturity 202.5 million Statements of Cash Flows. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company had positive cash flows from operating activities. The Company experienced positive cash flows from investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021, and negative cash flows from investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020. The Company experienced negative cash flows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021, and positive cash flows from financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020. Cash flows from operating activities for the periods covered by the Statements of Cash Flows have been primarily related to changes in accrued and deferred assets, credits and other liabilities, the provision for credit losses, realized gains on the sale of investment securities and loans, depreciation and amortization and the amortization of deferred loan origination fees and discounts (premiums) on loans and investments, all of which are non-cash or non-operating adjustments to operating cash flows. Net income adjusted for non-cash and non-operating items and the origination and sale of loans held-for-sale were the primary sources of cash flows from operating activities. Operating activities provided cash flows of 66.6 million, 85.0 million and 46.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, investing activities used cash of 801.3 million, provided cash of 190.7 million and used cash of 131.3 million, respectively, primarily due to the net increases and purchases of loans (2022 and 2020) and investment securities (2022, 2021 and 2020), partially offset by cash received for the termination of interest rate derivatives (2020). During 2021, investing activities provided cash as net loan repayments exceeded the purchase of loans and investment securities.

 Changes in cash flows from financing activities during the periods covered by the Statements of Cash Flows are primarily due to changes in deposits after interest credited, changes in short-term borrowings, proceeds from the issuance of subordinated notes, redemption of subordinated notes, purchases of the Company s common stock and dividend payments to stockholders. Financing activities provided cash flows of 186.0 million and 428.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020, respectively, primarily due to increases in customer deposit balances, net increases or decreases in various borrowings and proceeds from the issuance of subordinated notes (2020), partially offset by dividend payments to stockholders and purchases of the Company s common stock. Financing activities used cash flows of 122.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, as dividend payments to stockholders, redemption of subordinated notes and purchases of the Company s common stock exceeded the net increase in deposits. Capital Resources Management continuously reviews the capital position of the Company and the Bank to ensure compliance with minimum regulatory requirements, as well as to explore ways to increase capital either by retained earnings or other means. As of December 31, 2022, total stockholders equity and common stockholders equity were each 533.1 million, or 9.4 of total assets, equivalent to a book value of 43.58 per common share. As of December 31, 2021, total stockholders equity and common stockholders equity were each 616.8 million, or 11.3 of total assets, equivalent to a book value of 46.98 per common share. At December 31, 2022, the Company s tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 9.2 , compared to 11.2 at December 31, 2021. Included in stockholders equity at December 31, 2022 and 2021, were unrealized gains (losses) (net of taxes) on the Company s available-for-sale investment securities totaling (47.2 million) and 9.1 million, respectively. This change from a net unrealized gain to a net unrealized loss during 2022 primarily resulted from increasing market interest rates throughout 2022, which decreased the fair value of investment securities. In addition, included in stockholders equity at December 31, 2022, were realized gains (net of taxes) on the Company s cash flow hedge (interest rate swap), which was terminated in March 2020, totaling 17.4 million. This amount, plus associated deferred taxes, is expected to be accreted to interest income over the remaining term of the original interest rate swap contract, which was to end in October 2025. At December 31, 2022, the remaining pre-tax amount to be recorded in interest income was 22.5 million. The net effect on total stockholders equity over time will be no impact as the reduction of this realized gain will be offset by an increase in retained earnings (as the interest income flows through pre-tax income). Also included in stockholders equity at December 31, 2022, was an unrealized loss (net of taxes) on the Company s three outstanding cash flow hedges (three interest rate swaps) totaling 23.6 million. Increases in market interest rates since the inception of these hedges have caused their fair values to decrease. Banks are required to maintain minimum risk-based capital ratios. These ratios compare capital, as defined by the risk-based regulations, to assets adjusted for their relative risk as defined by the regulations. Under current guidelines, which became effective January 1, 2015, banks must have a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.50 , a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.00 , a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8.00 , and a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.00 . To be considered well capitalized, banks must have a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.50 , a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.00 , a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 10.00 , and a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.00 . On December 31, 2022, the Bank s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.9 , its Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.9 , its total capital ratio was 13.1 and its Tier 1 leverage ratio was 11.5 . As a result, as of December 31, 2022, the Bank was well capitalized, with capital ratios in excess of those required to qualify as such. On December 31, 2021, the Bank s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.1 , its Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.1 , its total capital ratio was 15.4 and its Tier 1 leverage ratio was 11.9 . As a result, as of December 31, 2021, the Bank was well capitalized, with capital ratios in excess of those required to qualify as such. The FRB has established capital regulations for bank holding companies that generally parallel the capital regulations for banks. On December 31, 2022, the Company s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.6 , its Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.0 , its total capital ratio was 13.5 and its Tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.6 . To be considered well capitalized, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.00 and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.00 . As of December 31, 2022, the Company was considered well capitalized, with capital ratios in excess of those required to qualify as such. On December 31, 2021, the Company s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.9 , its Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.4 , its total capital ratio was 16.3 and its Tier 1 leverage ratio was 11.3 . As of December 31, 2021, the Company was considered well capitalized, with capital ratios in excess of those required to qualify as such.

 In addition to the minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and total risk-based capital ratio, the Company and the Bank have to maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional common equity Tier 1 capital greater than 2.5 of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, repurchasing shares, and paying discretionary bonuses. Both the Company and the Bank had a capital conservation buffer that exceeded the required minimum levels at December 31, 2022 and 2021. On August 15, 2021, the Company completed the redemption, at par, of all 75.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.25 fixed to floating rate subordinated notes due August 15, 2026. The total redemption price was 100 of the aggregate principal balance of the subordinated notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company utilized cash on hand for the redemption payment. These subordinated notes were included as capital in the Company s calculation of its total capital ratio. Dividends . During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company declared common stock cash dividends of 1.56 per share (25.9 of net income per common share) and paid common stock cash dividends of 1.52 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company declared common stock cash dividends of 1.40 per share (25.6 of net income per common share) and paid common stock cash dividends of 1.38 per share. The Board of Directors meets regularly to consider the level and the timing of dividend payments. The 0.40 per share dividend declared but unpaid as of December 31, 2022, was paid to stockholders in January 2023. Common Stock Repurchases and Issuances . The Company has been in various buy-back programs since May 1990. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company repurchased 1,043,804 shares of its common stock at an average price of 59.25 per share and 715,397 shares of its common stock at an average price of 54.69 per share, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company issued 146,601 shares of stock at an average price of 42.69 per share and 91,285 shares of stock at an average price of 40.53 per share, respectively, to cover stock option exercises. In January 2022, the Company s Board of Directors authorized management to purchase up to one million shares of the Company s outstanding common stock, under a program of open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. At December 31, 2022, there were approximately 177,000 shares which could still be purchased under this authorization. In December 2022, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional one million shares of the Company s outstanding common stock, under a program of open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, resulting in a total of approximately 1.2 million shares currently available in our stock repurchase authorization. Management has historically utilized stock buy-back programs from time to time as long as management believed that repurchasing the stock would contribute to the overall growth of shareholder value. The number of shares of stock that will be repurchased at any particular time and the prices that will be paid are subject to many factors, several of which are outside of the control of the Company. The primary factors, however, are the number of shares available in the market from sellers at any given time, the price of the stock within the market as determined by the market and the projected impact on the Company s earnings per share and capital. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This document contains certain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures includes the efficiency ratio excluding consulting expense and related contract termination liability and tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio. We calculate the efficiency ratio excluding consulting expense and related contract termination liability by subtracting from the non-interest expense component of the ratio the consulting expense and contract termination fee we incurred during 2021 in connection with the evaluation of our core and ancillary software and information technology systems. We had no such expenses or fees during 2022. Management believes the efficiency ratio calculated in this manner better reflects our core operating performance and makes this ratio more meaningful when comparing our operating results to different periods. In calculating the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, we subtract period-end intangible assets from common equity and from total assets. Management believes that the presentation of this measure excluding the impact of intangible assets provides useful supplemental information that is helpful in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, as it provides a method to assess management s success in utilizing our tangible capital as well as our capital strength. Management also believes that providing a measure that excludes balances of intangible assets, which are subjective components of valuation, facilitates the

 comparison of our performance with the performance of our peers. In addition, management believes that this is a standard financial measure used in the banking industry to evaluate performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and are not a substitute for any analysis based on GAAP financial measures. Because not all companies use the same calculation of non-GAAP measures, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures as calculated by other companies.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Asset and Liability Management and Market Risk A principal operating objective of the Company is to produce stable earnings by achieving a favorable interest rate spread that can be sustained during fluctuations in prevailing interest rates. The Company has sought to reduce its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates by attempting to achieve a closer match between the periods in which its interest-bearing liabilities and interest-earning assets can be expected to reprice through the origination of adjustable-rate mortgages and loans with shorter terms to maturity and the purchase of other shorter term interest-earning assets. Our Risk When Interest Rates Change The rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time. Market interest rates change over time. Accordingly, our results of operations, like those of other financial institutions, are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. The risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk. How We Measure the Risk to Us Associated with Interest Rate Changes 
 101 

Table of Contents 
 In an attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations, we monitor Great Southern s interest rate risk. In monitoring interest rate risk, we regularly analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates. The ability to maximize net interest income is largely dependent upon the achievement of a positive interest rate spread that can be sustained despite fluctuations in prevailing interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the difference between amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which either reprice or mature within a given period of time. The difference, or the interest rate repricing gap, provides an indication of the extent to which an institution s interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest-rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest-rate sensitive liabilities repricing during the same period, and is considered negative when the amount of interest-rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest-rate sensitive assets during the same period. Generally, during a period of rising interest rates, a negative gap within shorter repricing periods would adversely affect net interest income, while a positive gap within shorter repricing periods would result in an increase in net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, the opposite would be true. As of December 31, 2022, Great Southern s interest rate risk models indicate that, generally, rising interest rates are expected to have a positive impact on the Company s net interest income, while declining interest rates are expected to have a negative impact on net interest income. We model various interest rate scenarios for rising and falling rates, including both parallel and non-parallel shifts in rates. The results of our modeling indicate that net interest income is not likely to be significantly affected either positively or negatively in the first twelve months following relatively minor changes in market interest rates because our portfolios are relatively well-matched in a twelve-month horizon. In a situation where market interest rates increase significantly in a short period of time, our net interest margin increase may be more pronounced in the very near term (first one to three months), due to fairly rapid increases in LIBOR/SOFR interest rates (or their replacement rates) and prime interest rates. In a situation where market interest rates decrease significantly in a short period of time, as they did in March 2020, our net interest margin decrease may be more pronounced in the very near term (first one to three months), due to fairly rapid decreases in LIBOR/SOFR interest rates (or their replacement rates) and prime interest rates. In the subsequent months we expect that the net interest margin would stabilize and begin to improve, as renewal interest rates on maturing time deposits are expected to decrease compared to the then-current rates paid on those products. During 2020, we did experience some compression of our net interest margin percentage due to the Federal Fund rate being cut by a total of 2.25 from July 2019 through March 2020. Margin compression primarily resulted from changes in the asset mix, mainly the addition of lower-yielding assets and the issuance of subordinated notes during 2020 and the net interest margin remained lower than our historical average in 2021. LIBOR interest rates decreased significantly in 2020 and remained very low in 2021 and into the first three months of 2022, putting pressure on loan yields, and strong pricing competition for loans and deposits remains in most of our markets. Since March 2022, market interest rates have increased fairly rapidly and are expected to increase further in the first half of 2023. This increased loan yields and expanded our net interest income and net interest margin in 2022. While market interest rate increases are expected to result in increases to loan yields, we expect that much of this benefit will be offset by increased funding costs. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, cumulative time deposit maturities are as follows: within three months -- 237 million; within six months -- 733 million; and within twelve months -- 1.07 billion. At December 31, 2022, the weighted average interest rates on these various cumulative maturities were 1.42 , 1.87 and 2.09 , respectively. The current level and shape of the interest rate yield curve poses challenges for interest rate risk management. Prior to its increase of 0.25 on December 16, 2015, the FRB had last changed interest rates on December 16, 2008. This was the first rate increase since September 29, 2006. The FRB also implemented rate change increases of 0.25 on eight additional occasions beginning December 14, 2016 and through December 31, 2018, with the Federal Funds rate reaching as high as 2.50 . After December 2018, the FRB paused its rate increases and, in July, September and October 2019, implemented rate decreases of 0.25 on each of those occasions. At December 31, 2019, the Federal Funds rate stood at 1.75 . In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FRB decreased interest rates on two occasions in March 2020, a 0.50 decrease on March 3rd and a 1.00 decrease on March 16th. At December 31, 2021, the Federal Funds rate was 0.25 . In 2022, the FRB implemented rate increases of 0.25 , 0.50 , 0.75 , 0.75 , 0.75 , 0.75 and 0.50 in March, May, June, July, September, November and December 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2022, the Federal Funds rate was 4.50 , and is 4.75 currently. Financial markets expect further increases in Federal Funds interest rates in the first half of 2023, with 0.50-1.00 of additional cumulative rate hikes currently anticipated. A substantial portion of Great Southern s loan portfolio 958.8 million at December 31, 2022) is tied to the one-month or three-month LIBOR index and will be subject to adjustment at least once within 90 days after December 31, 2022. Of these loans, 958.4 million had interest rate floors. Great Southern s loan portfolio also includes loans 501.2 million at December 31, 2022) tied to various SOFR indexes that will be subject to adjustment at least once within 90 days after December 31, 2022. Of these loans, 501.2 million had interest rate floors. Great Southern also has a portfolio of loans 747.6 million at December 31, 2022) tied to a prime rate of interest that will adjust 
 102 

Table of Contents 
 immediately or within 90 days of a change to the prime rate of interest. Of these loans, 734.6 million had interest rate floors at various rates. Great Southern also has a portfolio of loans 6.7 million at December 31, 2022) tied to an AMERIBOR index that will adjust immediately or within 90 days of a change to the prime rate of interest. Of these loans, 6.7 million had interest rate floors at various rates. At December 31, 2022, nearly all of these LIBOR/SOFR and prime rate loans had fully-indexed rates that were at or above their floor rate and so are expected to move fully with future market interest rate increases. Interest rate risk exposure estimates (the sensitivity gap) are not exact measures of an institution s actual interest rate risk. They are only indicators of interest rate risk exposure produced in a simplified modeling environment designed to allow management to gauge the Bank s sensitivity to changes in interest rates. They do not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the Bank s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive and other factors beyond the Bank s control. As a result, certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may in fact mature or reprice at different times and in different amounts and cause a change, which potentially could be material, in the Bank s interest rate risk. In order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material and prolonged increases and decreases in interest rates on Great Southern s results of operations, Great Southern has adopted asset and liability management policies to better match the maturities and repricing terms of Great Southern s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Management recommends and the Board of Directors sets the asset and liability policies of Great Southern which are implemented by the Asset and Liability Committee. The Asset and Liability Committee is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and is comprised of members of Great Southern s senior management. The purpose of the Asset and Liability Committee is to communicate, coordinate and control asset/liability management consistent with Great Southern s business plan and board-approved policies. The Asset and Liability Committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads, interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs. The objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity, capital adequacy, growth, risk and profitability goals. The Asset and Liability Committee meets on a monthly basis to review, among other things, economic conditions and interest rate outlook, current and projected liquidity needs and capital positions and anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities. At each meeting, the Asset and Liability Committee recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review. The Chief Financial Officer or his designee is responsible for reviewing and reporting on the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the Board of Directors at their monthly meetings. In order to manage its assets and liabilities and achieve the desired liquidity, credit quality, interest rate risk, profitability and capital targets, Great Southern has focused its strategies on originating adjustable rate loans or loans with fixed rates that mature in less than five years, and managing its deposits and borrowings to establish stable relationships with both retail customers and wholesale funding sources. At times, depending on the level of general interest rates, the relationship between long- and short-term interest rates, market conditions and competitive factors, we may determine to increase our interest rate risk position somewhat in order to maintain or increase our net interest margin. The Asset and Liability Committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity, which is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential changes in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity that are authorized by the Board of Directors of Great Southern. In the normal course of business, the Company may use derivative financial instruments (primarily interest rate swaps) from time to time to assist in its interest rate risk management. In 2011, the Company began executing interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting interest rate swaps that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. Because the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings. These interest rate derivatives result from a service provided to certain qualifying customers and, therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in the Company s assets or liabilities. The Company manages a matched book with respect to its derivative instruments in order to minimize its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions.

 In October 2018, the Company entered into an interest rate swap transaction as part of its ongoing interest rate management strategies to hedge the risk of its floating rate loans. The notional amount of the swap was 400 million with a contractual termination date of October 6, 2025. Under the terms of the swap, the Company received a fixed rate of interest of 3.018 and paid a floating rate of interest equal to one-month USD-LIBOR. The floating rate reset monthly and net settlements of interest due to/from the counterparty also occurred monthly. Due to lower market interest rates, the Company received net interest settlements which were recorded as loan interest income. If USD-LIBOR exceeded the fixed rate of interest, the Company was required to pay net settlements to the counterparty and record those net payments as a reduction of interest income on loans. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative was reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affected earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings. In March 2020, the Company and its swap counterparty mutually agreed to terminate the 400 million interest rate swap prior to its contractual maturity. The Company was paid 45.9 million from its swap counterparty as a result of this termination. In March 2022, the Company entered into another interest rate swap transaction as part of its ongoing interest rate management strategies to hedge the risk of its floating rate loans. The notional amount of the swap is 300 million with an effective date of March 1, 2022 and a termination date of March 1, 2024. Under the terms of the swap, the Company will receive a fixed rate of interest of 1.6725 and will pay a floating rate of interest equal to one-month USD-LIBOR. The floating rate will be reset monthly and net settlements of interest due to/from the counterparty will also occur monthly. The initial floating rate of interest was set at 0.24143 . The Company will receive net interest settlements which will be recorded as loan interest income, to the extent that the fixed rate of interest exceeds one-month USD-LIBOR. If USD-LIBOR exceeds the fixed rate of interest in future periods, the Company will be required to pay net settlements to the counterparty and will record those net payments as a reduction of interest income on loans. In July 2022, the Company entered into two interest rate swap transactions as part of its ongoing interest rate management strategies to hedge the risk of its floating rate loans. The notional amount of each swap is 200 million with an effective date of May 1 2023 and a termination date of May 1, 2028. Under the terms of one swap, beginning in May 2023, the Company will receive a fixed rate of interest of 2.628 and will pay a floating rate of interest equal to one-month USD-SOFR OIS. Under the terms of the other swap, beginning in May 2023, the Company will receive a fixed rate of interest of 5.725 and will pay a floating rate of interest equal to one-month USD-Prime. In each case, the floating rate will be reset monthly and net settlements of interest due to/from the counterparty will also occur monthly. To the extent the fixed rate of interest exceeds the floating rate of interest, the Company will receive net interest settlements, which will be recorded as loan interest income. If the floating rate of interest exceeds the fixed rate of interest, the Company will be required to pay net settlements to the counterparty and will record those net payments as a reduction of interest income on loans. The Company s interest rate derivatives and hedging activities are discussed further in Note 16 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Stockholders, Board of Directors, and Audit Committee Great Southern Bancorp, Inc. Springfield, Missouri Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Great Southern Bancorp, Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and our report dated March 13, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Adoption of New Accounting Standard As discussed in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for the allowance for credit losses in 2021 due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involves our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of this critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

 Allowance for Credit Losses The Company s loan portfolio totaled 4.6 billion as of December 31, 2022, and the allowance for credit losses on loans was 63.5 million. The Company s unfunded loan commitments totaled 2.1 billion, with an allowance for credit loss of 12.8 million. Together these amounts represent the allowance for credit losses (ACL). The ACL on loans and unfunded commitments as defined by Topic 326 is an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments. The ACL is measured on a collective basis based on pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. Average historical loss rates over a defined lookback period are analyzed for the segmented loan pools, and adjusted for significant factors that, in management s judgment, reflect the impact of any current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Qualitative factors such as changes in economic conditions, concentrations of risk, and changes in portfolio risk are considered in determining the adequacy of the level of the ACL. The Company discloses that this determination involves a high degree of judgment and complexity and is inherently subjective. We identified the valuation of the ACL as a critical audit matter. Auditing the ACL involves a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating management s estimates, such as evaluating management s assessment of economic conditions and other qualitative or environmental factors, evaluating the adequacy of specifically identified losses on individually evaluated loans, and assessing the appropriateness of loan credit ratings. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: Obtaining an understanding of the Company s process for establishing the ACL; Testing the design and operating effectiveness of controls, including those related to technology, over the ACL including data completeness and accuracy, classifications of loans by loan segment, verification of historical net loss data and calculated net loss rates, the establishment of qualitative adjustments, credit ratings, and risk classification of loans and establishment of specific reserves on individually evaluated loans, and management s review and disclosure controls over the ACL; Testing of completeness and accuracy of the information utilized in the ACL; Testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation of the ACL; Evaluating the qualitative adjustments, including assessing the basis for the adjustments and the reasonableness of significant assumptions; Testing the loan review function and evaluating the accuracy of loan credit ratings; Evaluating the reasonableness of specific allowances on individually evaluated loans; Evaluating the overall reasonableness of assumptions used by management considering the past performance of the Company and evaluating trends identified within peer groups; Evaluating the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. /s/ (Formerly, BKD, LLP) We have served as the Company s auditor since 1975.

 , which do not necessarily share similar risk characteristics, are evaluated on an individual basis. For loans evaluated for credit losses on a collective basis, average historical loss rates are calculated for each pool using the Company s historical net charge-offs (combined charge-offs and recoveries by observable historical reporting period) and outstanding loan balances during a lookback period. Lookback periods can be different based on the individual pool and represent management s credit expectations for the pool of loans over the remaining contractual life. In certain loan pools, if the Company s own historical loss rate is not reflective of the loss expectations, the historical loss rate is augmented by industry and peer data. The calculated average net charge-off rate is then adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. These adjustments increase or decrease the average historical loss rate to reflect expectations of future losses given economic forecasts of key macroeconomic variables including, but not limited to, unemployment rate, GDP, disposable income and market volatility. The adjustments are based

 million. This adjustment brought the balance of the allowance for credit losses to million as of January 1, 2021. In addition, the Company recorded an million liability for unfunded commitments as of January 1, 2021. The after-tax effect decreased retained earnings by million. The adjustment was based upon the Company s analysis of then-current conditions, assumptions and economic forecasts at January 1, 2021. The Company adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for financial assets purchased with credit deterioration (PCD) that were previously classified as purchased credit impaired (PCI) and accounted for under ASC 310-30. In accordance with the standard, management did not reassess whether PCI assets met the criteria of PCD assets as of the date of adoption. On January 1, 2021, the amortized cost basis of the PCD assets were adjusted to reflect the addition of million to the allowance for credit losses. Results for reporting periods prior to January 1, 2021, continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. Under the incurred loss model, the Company delayed recognition of losses until it was probable that a loss was incurred. The allowance for credit losses was established as losses were estimated to have occurred through a provision for credit losses charged to earnings. Credit losses were charged against the allowance when management believed the uncollectability of a loan balance was confirmed. The allowance for credit losses was evaluated on a regular basis by management and was based upon management s periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. The allowance consisted of allocated and general components. The allocated component related to loans that were classified as impaired. For loans classified as impaired, an allowance was established when the present value of expected future cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan was lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covered non-classified loans and was based on historical charge-off experience and expected loss given default derived from the Company s internal risk rating process. Results for reporting periods after December 31, 2020, include loans acquired and accounted for under ASC 310-30 net of discount within the loan classes, while for reporting periods prior to January 1, 2021, the loans acquired and accounted for under ASC 310-30 were shown separately.

 , are evaluated on an individual basis. For loans evaluated for credit losses on a collective basis, average historical loss rates are calculated for each pool using the Company s historical net charge-offs (combined charge-offs and recoveries by observable historical reporting period) and outstanding loan balances during a lookback period. Lookback periods can be different based on the individual pool and represent management s credit expectations for the pool of loans over the remaining contractual life. In certain loan pools, if the Company s own historical loss rate is not reflective of the loss expectations, the historical loss rate is augmented by industry and peer data. The calculated average net charge-off rate is then adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. These adjustments increase or decrease the average historical loss rate to reflect expectations of future losses given economic forecasts of key macroeconomic variables including, but not limited to, unemployment rate, gross domestic product GDP ), commercial real estate price index, consumer sentiment and construction spending. The adjustments are based on results from various regression models projecting the impact of the macroeconomic variables to loss rates. The forecast is used for a reasonable and supportable period before reverting to historical averages. The forecast-adjusted loss rate is applied to the amortized cost of loans over the remaining contractual lives, adjusted for expected prepayments. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications unless there is a reasonable expectation that a troubled debt restructuring TDR will be executed. Additionally, the allowance for credit losses considers other qualitative factors not included in historical loss rates or macroeconomic forecasts such as changes in portfolio composition, underwriting practices, or significant unique events or conditions. ASU 2016-13 requires an allowance for off balance sheet credit exposures: unfunded lines of credit, undisbursed portions of loans, written residential and commercial commitments, and letters of credit. To determine the amount needed for allowance purposes, a utilization rate is determined either by the model or internally for each pool. Our loss model calculates the reserve on unfunded commitments based upon the utilization rate multiplied by the average loss rate factors in each pool with unfunded and committed balances. The liability for unfunded lending commitments utilizes the same model as the allowance for credit losses on loans; however, the liability for unfunded lending commitments incorporates assumptions for the portion of unfunded commitments that are expected to be funded.

Factors considered in the valuations were projected cash flows for the loans, type of loan and related collateral, classification status, fixed or variable interest rate, term of loan, current discount rates and whether or not the loan was amortizing. Loans were grouped together according to similar characteristics and were treated in the aggregate when applying various valuation techniques. Management also estimated the amount of credit losses that were expected to be realized for the loan portfolios. The discounted cash flow approach was used to value each pool of loans. For non-performing loans, fair value was estimated by calculating the present value of the recoverable cash flows using a discount rate based on comparable corporate bond rates. The amount of the estimated cash flows expected to be received from the acquired loan pools in excess of the fair values recorded for the loan pools is referred to as the accretable yield. The accretable yield is recognized as interest income over the estimated lives of the loans. As of January 1, 2021, we adopted the new accounting standard related to accounting for credit losses. With the adoption of this standard, discounts are no longer reclassified from non-accretable to accretable. All adjustments made prior to January 1, 2021 continue to be accreted to interest income. The adjustments to accretable yield made prior to 2021, impacted the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income by 429,000 , million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

There have been no significant changes in the valuation techniques during the year ended December 31, 2022. Available-for-Sale Securities Investment securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair values used by the Company are obtained from an independent pricing service, which represent either quoted market prices for the identical asset or fair values determined by pricing models, or other model-based valuation techniques, that consider observable market data, such as interest rate volatilities, LIBOR/SOFR yield curve, credit spreads and prices from market makers and live trading systems. Recurring Level 2 securities include U.S. government agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, state and municipal bonds and certain other investments. Inputs used for valuing Level 2 securities include observable data that may include dealer quotes, benchmark yields, market spreads, live trading levels and market consensus prepayment speeds, among other things. Additional inputs include indicative values derived from the independent pricing service s proprietary computerized models. There were recurring Level 3 securities at December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021. Interest Rate Derivatives The fair value is estimated using forward-looking interest rate curves and is determined using observable market rates and, therefore, are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

 Foreclosed assets held for sale December 31, 2021 Collateral-dependent loans Foreclosed assets held for sale Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and recognized in the accompanying statements of financial condition, as well as the general classification of such assets pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. For assets classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the process used to develop the reported fair value is described below. Loans Held for Sale Mortgage loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value. The fair value of mortgage loans held for sale is based on what secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics. As such, the Company classifies mortgage loans held for sale as Nonrecurring Level 2. Write-downs to fair value typically do not occur as the Company generally enters into commitments to sell individual mortgage loans at the time the loan is originated to reduce market risk. The Company typically does not have commercial loans held for sale. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the aggregate fair value of mortgage loans held for sale was not materially different than their cost. Accordingly, no mortgage loans held for sale were marked down and reported at fair value. Collateral-Dependent Loans When the Company has a specific expectation to initiate, or has initiated, foreclosure proceedings, and when the repayment of a loan is expected to be substantially dependent on the liquidation of underlying collateral, the relationship is deemed collateral-dependent. The fair value of collateral used by the Company was determined by obtaining an observable market price or by obtaining an appraised value from an independent, licensed or certified appraiser, using observable market data. This data included information such as selling price of similar properties and capitalization rates of similar properties sold within the market, expected future cash flows or earnings of the subject property based on current market expectations, and other relevant factors. All appraised values were adjusted for market-related trends based on the Company s experience in sales and other appraisals of similar property types as well as estimated selling costs. Each quarter, management reviewed all collateral-dependent impaired loans on a loan-by-loan basis to determine whether updated appraisals were necessary based on loan performance, collateral type and guarantor support. At times, the Company measured the fair value of collateral-dependent impaired loans using appraisals with dates more than one year prior to the date of review. These appraisals were discounted by applying current, observable market data about similar property types such as sales contracts, estimations of value by individuals familiar with the market, other appraisals, sales or collateral assessments based on current market activity until updated appraisals are obtained. Depending on the length of time since an appraisal was performed and

 - . The policy described above was the same for all types of collateral-dependent loans. The Company records collateral-dependent loans as Nonrecurring Level 3. If a loan s fair value as estimated by the Company is less than its carrying value, the Company either records a charge-off of the portion of the loan that exceeds the fair value or establishes a reserve within the allowance for credit losses specific to the loan. Loans for which such charge-offs or reserves were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, are shown in the table above (net of reserves). Foreclosed Assets Held for Sale Foreclosed assets held for sale are initially recorded at fair value less estimated cost to sell at the date of foreclosure. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less estimated cost to sell. Foreclosed assets held for sale are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The foreclosed assets represented in the table above have been re-measured during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, subsequent to their initial transfer to foreclosed assets. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The following methods were used to estimate the fair value of all other financial instruments recognized in the accompanying statements of financial condition at amounts other than fair value. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Federal Home Loan Bank Stock The carrying amount approximates fair value. Held-to-Maturity Securities Fair values for held-to-maturity securities are estimated based on quoted market prices of similar securities. For these securities, the Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service, which represent either quoted market prices for the identical asset or fair values determined by pricing models, or other model-based valuation techniques, that consider observable market data, such as interest rate volatilities, LIBOR/SOFR yield curve, credit spreads and prices from market makers and live trading systems. These securities include U.S. government agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, state and municipal bonds and certain other investments. Loans and Interest Receivable The fair value of loans is estimated on an exit price basis incorporating contractual cash flow, prepayments discount spreads, credit loss and liquidity premiums. Loans with similar characteristics are aggregated for purposes of the calculations. The carrying amount of accrued interest receivable approximates its fair value. Deposits and Accrued Interest Payable The fair value of demand deposits and savings accounts is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date, i.e., their carrying amounts. The fair value of fixed maturity certificates of deposit is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation using the average advances yield curve from 11 districts of the FHLB for the as of date. The carrying amount of accrued interest payable approximates its fair value. Short-Term Borrowings The carrying amount approximates fair value.

Cash Flow Hedges Interest Rate Swap. As a strategy to maintain acceptable levels of exposure to the risk of changes in future cash flows due to interest rate fluctuations, in October 2018, the Company entered into an interest rate swap transaction as part of its ongoing interest rate management strategies to hedge the risk of its floating rate loans. The notional amount of the swap was million with a termination date of October 6, 2025. Under the terms of the swap, the Company received a fixed rate of interest of and paid a floating rate of interest equal to one-month USD-LIBOR. The floating rate was reset monthly and net settlements of interest due to/from the counterparty also occurred monthly. To the extent that the fixed rate of interest exceeded one-month USD-LIBOR, the Company received net interest settlements which were recorded as loan interest income. If USD-LIBOR exceeded the fixed rate of interest, the Company was required to pay net settlements to the counterparty and record those net payments as a reduction of interest income on loans. In March 2020, the Company and its swap counterparty mutually agreed to terminate the million interest rate swap prior to its contractual maturity. The Company was paid million from its swap counterparty as a result of this termination. This million, less the accrued interest portion and net of deferred income taxes, was reflected in the Company s stockholders equity as Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and a portion of it is being accreted to interest income on loans monthly through the original contractual termination date of October 6, 2025. This has the effect of reducing Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and increasing Net Interest Income and Retained Earnings over the period. The Company recorded interest income of million,

 million and million on this interest rate swap during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2022, the Company expected to have a sufficient amount of eligible variable rate loans to continue to accrete this interest income in future periods. If this expectation changes and the amount of eligible variable rate loans decreases significantly, the Company may be required to recognize this interest income more rapidly. In March 2022, the Company entered into an interest rate swap transaction as part of its ongoing interest rate management strategies to hedge the risk of its floating rate loans. The notional amount of the swap is million, with a termination date of March 1, 2024. Under the terms of the swap, the Company receives a fixed rate of interest of and pays a floating rate of interest equal to one-month USD-LIBOR (or the equivalent replacement rate if USD-LIBOR rate is not available). The floating rate resets monthly and net settlements of interest due to/from the counterparty also occur monthly. The floating rate of interest was as of December 31, 2022. To the extend the floating rate of interest exceeds the fixed rate of interest, the Company will be required to pay net settlements to the counterparty and will record those net payments as a reduction of interest income on loans. If the fixed rate of interest exceeds the floating rate of interest, the Company will receive net interest settlements, which will be recorded as loan interest income. The Company recorded a reduction of loan interest income related to this swap transaction of for the year ended December 31, 2022. In July 2022, the Company entered into two additional interest rate swap transactions as part of its ongoing interest rate management strategies to hedge the risk of its floating rate loans. The notional amount of each swap is million with an effective date of May 1, 2023 and a termination date of May 1, 2028. Under the terms of one swap, beginning in May 2023, the Company will receive a fixed rate of interest of and will pay a floating rate of interest equal to one-month USD-SOFR OIS. Under the terms of the other swap, beginning in May 2023, the Company will receive a fixed rate of interest of and will pay a floating rate of interest equal to one-month USD-Prime. In each case, the floating rate will be reset monthly and net settlements of interest due to/from the counterparty will also occur monthly. To the extent the fixed rate of interest exceeds the floating rate of interest, the Company will receive net interest settlements, which will be recorded as loan interest income. If the floating rate of interest exceeds the fixed rate of interest, the Company will be required to pay net settlements to the counterparty and will record those net payments as a reduction of interest income on loans. At December 31, 2022, the USD-Prime rate was and the one-month USD-SOFR OIS rate was . The effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affected earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.

Letters of Credit Standby letters of credit are irrevocable conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Financial standby letters of credit are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing and similar transactions. Performance standby letters of credit are issued to guarantee performance of certain customers under nonfinancial contractual obligations. The credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. Fees for letters of credit issued are initially recorded by the Bank as deferred revenue and are included in earnings at the termination of the respective agreements. Should the Bank be obligated to perform under the standby letters of credit, the Bank may seek recourse from the customer for reimbursement of amounts paid. The Company had total outstanding standby letters of credit amounting to approximately million and million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, with no letters of credit having terms over five years.

These options typically vest one-fourth at the end of each of years two, three, four and five from the grant date. As provided for under FASB ASC 718, the Company has elected to recognize compensation expense for options with graded vesting schedules on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire option grant. In addition, ASC 718 requires companies to recognize compensation expense based on the estimated number of stock options for which service is expected to be rendered. The Company s historical forfeitures of its share-based awards have not been significant. Forfeitures are estimated annually based on historical information. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020: Risk-free interest rate Expected life of options Expected volatility Weighted average fair value of options granted during year Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock, based on the monthly closing stock price. The expected life of options granted is based on actual historical exercise behavior of all employees and directors and approximates the graded vesting period of the options. Expected dividends are based on the annualized dividends declared at the time of the option grant. For 2022, the risk-free interest rate is based on the average of the five-year treasury rate and the seven-year treasury rate on the grant date of the options. For 2021 and 2020, the risk-free interest rate is based on the five-year treasury rate on the grant date of the options.

 ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )) that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported accurately and within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate. An evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures was carried out as of December 31, 2022, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and several other members of our senior management. Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that the information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Act is (i) accumulated and communicated to our management (including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer) to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. The annual report of management on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and the attestation report thereon issued by our independent registered public accounting firm are set forth below under Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. We do not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns in controls or procedures can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any control procedure also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The management of Great Southern Bancorp, Inc. (the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on that assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective. The Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, has been audited by FORVIS, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 is set forth below.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and our report dated March 13, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definitions and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/FORVIS, LLP (Formerly, BKD, LLP) Springfield, Missouri March 13, 2023
