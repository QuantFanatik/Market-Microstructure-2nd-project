ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 Introduction 
 Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. is a provider of market infrastructure, data services and technology solutions to a broad range of customers including financial institutions, corporations and government entities. Our products, which span major asset classes including futures, equities, fixed income and residential mortgages in the U.S., provide our customers with access to mission critical tools that are designed to increase asset class transparency and workflow efficiency. Although we report our results in three reportable business segments, we operate as one business, leveraging the collective expertise, particularly in data services and technology, that exists across our platforms to inform and enhance our operations. Our segments are as follows: 
 Exchanges: We operate regulated marketplaces for the listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives contracts and financial securities. 
 Fixed Income and Data Services: We provide fixed income pricing, reference data, indices, analytics and execution services as well as global credit default swaps, or CDS, clearing and multi-asset class data delivery solutions. 
 Mortgage Technology: We provide a technology platform that offers customers comprehensive, digital workflow tools that aim to address the inefficiencies that exist in the U.S. residential mortgage market, from application through closing and the secondary market. 
 
 Our History 
 In 2000, ICE was founded with the idea of transforming energy markets by creating a network that removed barriers and provided greater transparency, efficiency and access. By staying close to our customers, we have expanded into new asset classes and services, while retaining a core mission of reducing friction in markets, bringing efficiency to our customers workflows and, ultimately, connecting our customers to opportunity. 
 Today, we are a Fortune 500 company, providing our customers with an array of market infrastructure, data services and technology solutions that span a diverse set of asset classes. 
 4 

Our Business Segments 
 Our business is conducted through three reportable business segments: 
 Exchanges; 
 Fixed Income and Data Services; and 
 Mortgage Technology. 
 The majority of our identifiable assets are located in the U.S. and the United Kingdom, or U.K. For a summary of our revenues, net assets and net property and equipment by geographic region, see Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. 
 Exchanges Segment 
 We operate regulated marketplaces for the listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives contracts and financial securities, such as commodities, interest rates, foreign exchange and equities as well as corporate and exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. We operate multiple trading venues, including 13 regulated exchanges and six clearing houses, which are strategically positioned in major market centers around the world, including the U.S., U.K., European Union, or EU, Canada, Asia Pacific and the Middle East. 
 Our Exchanges segment includes trading and listings revenue from our global futures network and the New York Stock Exchange and other registered securities exchanges, or collectively, the NYSE, and various data and connectivity services that are directly related to those exchange platforms. Revenues reflect a mix of both diversified transaction revenues and recurring data and listings revenues. Our Exchanges segment generated revenues, less transaction-based expenses of 4.1 billion and accounted for 56 of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses in 2022. Our Exchanges business can experience moderate seasonal fluctuations, although such seasonal impacts have been somewhat muted in periods of high volume trading. Key asset classes include: 
 Energy Futures and Options: We offer a range of futures and options products that are designed to enable our customers to manage their risk across global energy markets. Our flagship Brent crude oil contract serves as the cornerstone of a global oil network that today includes over 730 related crude and refined oil products including locational and refined spreads. In addition, as natural gas and Liquefied Natural Gas, or LNG, continue to globalize, we offer the broadest footprint of regional and global natural gas benchmarks, which span North America, Europe and Asia. Our leading environmental and power markets round out our diverse global energy network. For over two decades, our environmental markets have provided customers risk management tools to meet carbon cap and trade program requirements and renewable fuel standards. Increasingly, market participants are turning to our global environmental markets to help navigate and manage risk related to climate change, the energy transition and the move to net zero emissions. 
 5 

Agricultural Metals Futures and Options: We offer futures and options on the leading global soft commodity markets including coffee, cocoa, cotton and sugar. Our benchmark contracts offer the most globally relevant price markers for these agricultural markets and provide our customers with the tools to manage price and counterparty risk and facilitate price discovery. 
 
 Financial Futures and Options: We offer a diverse suite of equity futures and options contracts based on our own indices as well as those created by MSCI and FTSE . These contracts range from established global benchmarks, such as the MSCI Emerging Market Index, to newer products, such as MSCI s suite of Environmental, Social and Governance, or ESG, indices and the NYSE FAANG+ Index. Our global interest rate complex spans geographies, currencies and tenors, providing participants around the world with tools to manage risk in a capital efficient manner. Key products during 2022 included: Euribor, Gilts, Sterling Overnight Index Average, or SONIA, and Secured Overnight Financing Rates, or SOFR, among others. 
 
 Cash Equities and Equity Options: We offer securities trading services through our five registered securities exchanges, including the NYSE. Our securities exchanges are leading providers of transparent, efficient, and high quality markets for the securities issued by large and small companies, ETFs and equity options. These markets serve issuers, investors and other market participants across five cash equity and two options markets. 
 
 Listings: The NYSE has been the venue of choice for innovators, visionaries and leaders for over 230 years. The NYSE offers a unique hybrid market model that combines leading technology with an accountable market maker to provide human judgment, a community of the world s greatest companies and premium brand visibility. With over 70 of S P 500 companies listed on the NYSE as of December 31, 2022, we are the leading listing venue across a range of sectors from technology and healthcare, to financials and energy. In addition to corporate listings, the NYSE is the global leader in ETF listings with 75 , or roughly 4.9 trillion, of ETF assets under management, or AUM, as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, in 2022, NYSE listed over 345 billion in total market value from initial public offerings, or IPOs, including three of the top five operating company IPOs defined by offering proceeds raised, follow-on offerings and over 30 transfers from competing exchanges. Revenues from listing fees are largely recurring in nature. 
 
 Data and Connectivity Services: Our exchange data services include, among other offerings, proprietary real-time and historical pricing data, as well as order book and transaction information related to our global futures markets and the NYSE exchanges. In addition, we receive a share of revenue from the sale of consolidated U.S. equity and options market data by the National Market System Plans, or NMS Plans. 
 Separately, we also provide connectivity services directly related to our futures, cash equity and options exchanges and clearing houses. Revenues from data and connectivity services fees are largely recurring in nature. 
 
 OTC and Other: Our over-the-counter, or OTC, markets include bilateral energy markets that offer electronic trading of contracts based on physically-settled natural gas, power and refined oil contracts. Our other revenues primarily include interest income on certain clearing margin deposits related to our futures business, as well as revenue related to our digital asset initiative, Bakkt Holdings, LLC, or Bakkt, until it merged with VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings, or VIH, in October 2021. 
 
 We operate six clearing houses, each of which acts as a central counterparty, or CCP, that, for its clearing members, becomes the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer. Through this CCP function, our clearing houses provide financial security for each transaction, for the duration of the position, by limiting counterparty credit risk. Our clearing houses are responsible for providing clearing services to each of our futures exchanges, and in some cases, to third-party execution venues. 
 
 Mechanisms have been created, called guaranty funds, to provide partial protection in the event of a clearing member default. Except for ICE NGX Canada Inc., or ICE NGX, each of the ICE Clearing Houses (as defined below) requires that each clearing member make deposits into a guaranty fund maintained by the relevant ICE Clearing House. In addition, we have contributed 405 million of our own cash to the guaranty funds which is one component of the table below, and such amounts are at risk and could be used in the event of a clearing member default. We also maintain default insurance as an additional layer of clearing member default protection, which is also reflected in the table below. The default insurance was renewed in September 2022 and has a three-year term for the following clearing houses in the following amounts: ICE Clear Europe - 100 million; ICE Clear U.S. - 25 million; and ICE Clear Credit - 75 million. In addition, the table below includes a guaranty fund of 215 million maintained by ICE NGX funded by the following: (1) a 200 million letter of credit issued by a major Canadian chartered bank, and backed by default insurance underwritten by Export Development 
 6 

Canada, a Crown corporation operated at arm s length from the Canadian government, and (2) 15 million, which is included in our total cash contribution of 405 million, held as restricted cash to fund the first loss amount ICE NGX is responsible for under the default insurance policy. 
 
 Our contributions to each clearing house as of December 31, 2022 are listed below and our clearing houses are referred to herein collectively as the ICE Clearing Houses :

Our leading fixed income pricing and reference data offerings serve as the foundation for a broader fixed income network that provides our customers solutions that span the full workflow including pre- and post-trade analytics, a range of execution protocols and indices. In addition, our multi-asset class connectivity, feeds and desktop solutions, which comprise our Other Data and Network Services business, leverage a common sales force, which can enhance cross-selling opportunities across the Fixed Income and Data Services segment. The Fixed Income and Data Services segment generated revenues of 2.1 billion in 2022 and accounted for 29 of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses. 
 Fixed Income Data and Analytics: We are a leading provider of evaluated end-of-day and real-time pricing services on approximately three million fixed income securities spanning nearly 150 countries and 80 currencies including sovereign, corporate and municipal bonds, mortgage and asset-backed securities as well as leveraged loans.

We also offer a range of fixed income analytics and other workflow solutions including: best execution services, liquidity indicators, fixed income portfolio analytics and our ETF Hub. Our fixed income customers rely on our data, indices and analytics to inform pre-trade decision making, support post-trade regulatory and compliance needs and improve operational efficiency.

Other Data and Network Service revenues are largely recurring in nature. 
 Mortgage Technology Segment 
 Over the last six years, ICE has constructed a network aimed at identifying and solving the inefficiencies that exist in the U.S. residential mortgage market. From application through closing and the secondary market, our network is intended to connect the key stakeholders across the mortgage origination workflow and provide our customers with data services and technology that deliver greater transparency and enable significant customer efficiency gains. Our Mortgage Technology segment generated revenues of 1.1 billion in 2022 and accounted for 15 of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses. 
 Origination Technology: Our origination technology acts as a system of record for the mortgage transaction, automating the gathering, reviewing, and verifying of mortgage-related information and enabling automated enforcement of rules and business practices designed to help ensure that each completed loan transaction is of high quality and adheres to secondary market standards. These revenues are based on recurring Software as a Service, or SaaS, subscription fees, with an additive success-based pricing fee as lenders exceed the number of loans closed that are included with their monthly base subscription. 
 In addition, the ICE Mortgage Technology network provides originators connectivity to the mortgage supply chain and facilitates the secure exchange of information between our customers and a broad ecosystem of third-party service providers, as well as lenders and investors that are critical to consummating the millions of loan transactions that occur on our origination network each year. Revenue from the ICE Mortgage Technology network is largely transaction-based. 
 Closing Solutions: Our closing solutions uniquely connect key participants, such as lenders, title and settlement agents and individual county recorders, to digitize the closing and recording process. Closing solutions also include revenues from our Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., or MERS, database, which provides a system of record for recording and tracking changes in mortgage servicing rights and beneficial ownership interests in loans secured by U.S. residential real estate. Revenues from closing solutions are largely transaction-based and are based on the volume of loan closings.

Product and Services Development 
 We leverage our customer relationships, global distribution, technology infrastructure and software development capabilities to diversify our products and services. We are continually developing, evaluating and testing new products to better serve our client base. The majority of our product development relates to evaluating new contracts, new data sets, new analytic offerings or new mortgage technologies. New contracts often must be reviewed and approved by relevant regulators. We expect to continue to invest in improving our data distribution and software services to meet the needs of our customers and improve their trading and connectivity experience by reducing latency, improving security and providing the most relevant information and data. 
 While we primarily develop our products and services internally, we also periodically evaluate and enter into strategic partnerships and licensing arrangements to develop new products and services.

 Technology is a key component of our business strategy and competitive position and we regard effective execution of our technology initiatives as crucial to our sustainable business operations, market competitiveness, compliance and risk management and overall success. Our technology solutions support our customers' workflows: trading and clearing technology, multi-asset class analytics, risk assessment tools, robust data offerings, mortgage technology, instant messaging capabilities and flexible connectivity and delivery solutions. Where feasible, we design and build our own systems and write our own software programs as we believe that having control over our technology allows us to be more responsive to our customers needs, better support the dynamic nature of our business, provide the highest quality technology and deliver relevant, timely and actionable data to the markets and customers we serve. 
 Trading Platforms and Technology: The ICE trading platform supports trading in our cleared futures and options markets as well as our bilateral OTC markets. We also offer voice brokers a facility for submitting block trades for products that are eligible for clearing. Speed, reliability, resilience, capacity and security are critical performance criteria for electronic trading platforms. Connectivity to our trading platform for our markets is available through our web-based front-end applications, as well as independent software vendors, or ISVs, and APIs. 
 The NYSE electronic trading platform features an open system architecture that allows users to access our system via front-end trading applications developed by ISVs. We developed core technology and architecture known as NYSE Pillar and have migrated all our Cash Equity Securities markets, Security Information Processor, or SIP, and Options Price Reporting Authority, or OPRA, and Arca Options platforms to this architecture. We also expect to migrate our NYSE Amex options markets to NYSE Pillar. This integrated platform was designed to improve performance and reduce the complexity of operating multiple trading systems for our customers, while enhancing consistency, performance and resiliency. 
 Clearing Technology: A broad range of clearing and risk management services are offered through the integrated technology infrastructure that serves our clearing houses. ICE clearing technology is an integrated service-oriented platform that enables post-trade management, position management, management of the clearing house risk waterfall, contract settlement and treasury management functions. The primary focus of our derivatives clearing houses is the risk management of clearing members throughout all facets of the position management and settlement lifecycles. Our extensive technology and rules-based risk systems provide analytical tools that allow us to determine margin, evaluate credit risk and monitor the trading activities and overall risk of clearing members. 
 Data Services Technology: ICE Data Services technology uses integrated platforms to capture, store and process information, perform analytics and maintain connectivity solutions using a single configurable data capture mechanism and flexible delivery capability. Together, the platforms are intended to enable real-time processing and delivery of information, accelerate new product development and improve production reliability. Our data and analytics are delivered via real-time messaging, files, web services and other on-demand facilities and state-of-the-art front-ends. In addition, the technology underpinning our ICE Global Network supports scalable bandwidth and a wide variety of connectivity options including fiber, wireless, colocation and hosting. 
 Mortgage Technology : The ICE Mortgage Technology platform enables lenders to originate, process, fund and deliver residential mortgages using various applications, APIs, data products and other services offered. The platform is developed using industry-leading software technologies and third-party services, including hosting with a combination of public cloud and private data centers. The platform is integrated with multiple services necessary for loan origination, such as credit reporting and other services that lenders leverage through our network, which is 
 9 

offered through the platform. The platform includes industry leading information security infrastructure to protect the confidentiality and integrity of our customers' data. 
 Operations 
 We operate regionally diverse primary and backup data centers and maintain comprehensive business continuity and disaster recovery plans and facilities. These are designed to enable nearly continuous availability of our markets and other services in the event of a business disruption or disaster. We maintain incident and crisis management plans that address responses to disruptive events at any of our locations worldwide. 
 Cybersecurity 
 Our business activities rely extensively on technology and software, including the systems used by our business partners, regulators and customers. In addition, our activities involve the use and retention of confidential data and information. These activities make us susceptible to cyberattacks. We employ the following activities, processes and strategies to help evaluate, manage and address these risks. 
 Strategy: We maintain a Cybersecurity Strategy, or CSS, which emphasizes consideration of the nature of our business, ongoing intelligence collection regarding cybersecurity threats, and initiatives to specifically address prominent areas of cybersecurity risk. The CSS outlines the key priorities for our cybersecurity program and the methods by which our Information Security department seeks to accomplish those goals. The CSS is ratified annually by the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors and when applicable, also by the corporate governance committees of our regulated subsidiaries. 
 Risk Management: Thematic threats such as sabotage, fraud, and theft of assets or customer data are used to frame our risk management activities. Asset theft often involves organized crime or financially motivated nations staging sophisticated, well-planned campaigns to steal significant cash, cryptocurrency, or equivalent assets. Our thematic threats, along with others, are evaluated by our Board of Directors as well as our Risk Committee, Chief Risk Officer and Chief Information Security Officer, or CISO. The CSS provides the framework we use for assessing risk, prioritizing testing, identifying remedial actions and validating improvements. The CSS also provides for the deployment of external and internal teams of ethical hackers that operate alongside our traditional vulnerability detection processes. 
 Information Sharing: We recognize the importance of collaboration and information sharing among private sector firms in the financial services sector, across sectors, and with global public-sector agencies, when appropriate. Our cybersecurity leaders hold positions within the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, or FS-ISAC, and the cross-sector Analysis and Resiliency Center, or ARC, in the U.S., the Financial Sector Cyber Collaboration Centre, or FSCCC, in the U.K., and similar organizations across the Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, and Asia Pacific, or APAC, regions. 
 Governance and Leadership: Our Information Security department is led by our CISO, who provides comprehensive reports to a dedicated internal governance committee at least quarterly outlining threat assessment, control performance, and ongoing enhancements. Additionally, cybersecurity matters are reported to and discussed with a cross-subsidiary leadership committee, the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors, and when applicable, subsidiary boards. Our CISO and other senior security leaders conduct periodic cybersecurity education sessions with our employees and directors. These sessions cover general cybersecurity topics as well as specific details regarding our cybersecurity program. 
 Third-Party Review: Our Information Security department utilizes extensive penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, ethical hacking and maturity assessment services from global leaders in these practices. The results of these reviews alongside frequent regulatory and customer examinations are assessed, with any resulting mitigation activity assigned and tracked to remediation. 
 Controls : Our identification of risks and selection of cyber-related controls is performed in the context of the critical financial infrastructure we maintain and operate. Our ongoing threat assessments are intended to identify changes in external events and in our activities, infrastructure and processes that could necessitate reprioritization of risks and controls. The nature of our business activities mandates an emphasis on sabotage and asset theft as primary threats in addition to contemporary themes of data theft. Our focus on these threats leads to an emphasis on network security, social engineering controls, behavioral detection of insider threat, and deliberate and rehearsed recovery strategies.

 Human Capital Resources 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 8,911 employees. In the U.S., we had a total of 4,973 employees, including 1,261 in New York, 1,147 in Georgia, 879 in California, 305 in Massachusetts and 267 in Illinois. Internationally, we had a total of 3,938 employees, including 2,159 in India, 788 in the U.K. and 418 in continental Europe. Of our total employee base, less than 1 is subject to collective bargaining agreements, and such relations are considered to be good. 
 We monitor voluntary attrition rates carefully, and over the past three years, our attrition rates have remained lower than the benchmarks in the finance and technology sectors. We review this data frequently and transparently report this information to our stakeholders via our Sustainability Report. 
 Corporate Culture 
 Highly capable and engaged teams are critically important to our ability to grow and innovate. Through our human capital management efforts, we strive to attract and retain the best talent in the world. Our industry is competitive, and the expectations are high. We aim to offer pay commensurate with performance, a diverse and inclusive work environment, significant opportunities for career growth and a culture that prioritizes collaboration and drives results. 
 We use a mix of channels to gather input from employees throughout our organization. Formal methods include our biennial employee survey and an annual review process. These efforts are supplemented with occasional pulse surveys on specific topics. Additionally, we actively strive to cultivate a work environment that encourages conversations across and within teams to provide informal and real-time feedback loops at all levels. 
 Employee Development 
 Employee development is an important element of our human capital management program. Career development and training opportunities are available throughout our ranks, including both structured course work across a variety of topics and situations, and self-directed learning from a wide array of available resources. 
 Compensation and Benefits 
 We strive to provide comprehensive packages of competitive compensation and benefits in each market in which we operate, which we believe is important to ensure our employees health, well-being and financial security. Through employee assistance plans, in most of our locations we provide free and discounted counseling services for dealing with traumatic life events, mental health issues and stress, as well as general wellness programs. We review the competitiveness of our compensation and benefits frequently. 
 Diversity and Inclusion 
 As an equal opportunity employer, all qualified applicants receive consideration without regard to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin or ancestry, age, disability or veteran status, or other protected status. 
 11 

We are focused on increasing and supporting diversity across our broader employee population and Board of Directors. We hold ourselves accountable via quarterly and annual data reporting to senior management, data reporting to our Board of Directors, and transparency in reporting data to our stakeholders via our annual Sustainability Report, including Equal Employment Opportunity, or EEO-1 data. 
 Corporate Giving 
 Financial education is the cornerstone of our corporate giving efforts, which include support for several organizations. We underwrite a digital financial education and data sciences curriculum that is delivered at no cost to grade school and high school students in the U.S. We make additional charitable contributions throughout the communities where we have offices and our employees are encouraged to do the same, including through an annual match to employees for charities of their choice. We offer an annual match of 5,000 per employee to encourage and reward our employees' charitable contributions. 
 Corporate Citizenship 
 We strive to create long-term value for our stockholders and meet sustainability goals for all of our stakeholders. That includes a focus on: 
 Human capital management: Our people are our greatest asset and fostering a diverse, engaged workforce is critical. 
 Risk management: From cybersecurity to operational resiliency to regulatory compliance, risk management is at the heart of how we operate. 
 Environmental risks and opportunities: We are addressing our impact on the climate, the climate s impact on our business and our opportunities to make a broader impact through our products and services.

 Our Competitive Strengths 
 We believe that we compete favorably based on numerous factors, and that our deep, liquid markets, technology offerings, breadth of product offerings, new product development, customer relationships, efficient, secure settlement, clearing and other support services and our reputation distinguish us from our competitors. We believe that to maintain our competitive position, we must continue to develop new and innovative products and services, enhance our technology infrastructure, maintain liquidity and offer competitive pricing. 
 We believe our key strengths include our: 
 Data Services: Across all three of our segments and our various networks, our data services aim to address the rising demand for independent, real-time information, which is being driven by regulation, market fragmentation and competition, increasing technology and data demands, increasing automation, as well as passive investing and indexation. We also believe our data services are uniquely relevant to our clients business operations and provide tools and services that enable greater workflow efficiency and, regardless of market conditions, are relied upon to serve the need for continuous information and analysis.

Competitors 
 The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We face competition in all aspects of our business from a number of different enterprises, both domestic and international, including traditional exchanges, electronic trading platforms, investment banks, data vendors, voice brokers, and mortgage and other technology providers. 
 Exchanges Segment 
 We face competition from other exchanges, electronic trading systems, third-party clearing houses, technology firms, market data vendors and trading facilities in the U.S. and globally. Some of the exchanges are consortiums formed by banks and exchanges. 
 We face significant competition with respect to equities trading, and this competition is expected to remain intense. Our current and prospective competitors include regulated markets, dark pools and other alternative trading systems, or ATSs, market makers and other execution venues. We also face competition from large investment banks, brokers and customers that may assume the role of principal and act as counterparty to orders originating from retail customers, or match their respective order flows through bilateral trading arrangements, including through internalization of order flow. NYSE Arca Options and NYSE American Options face considerable competition in the equity options markets; their principal U.S. competitors are Nasdaq, Inc., or Nasdaq, and Cboe Global Markets, Inc., or Cboe. 
 Our principal competitor for corporate listings in the U.S. is Nasdaq. For ETF listings, we compete with Nasdaq and Cboe. We also face competition for foreign issuer listings from a number of stock exchanges outside the U.S. As other liquidity venues and new entrants seek exchange status, we may face more competition for listings. 
 Fixed Income and Data Services Segment 
 Our fixed income trading venues, or ICE Bonds, compete with other electronic trading venues. Our platforms also compete for volume traded bilaterally or trading activity that is not done through an electronic venue. 
 14 

Our data services offerings face intense competition in all aspects of the business. We broadly compete with purchased third-party information and services from large global suppliers of financial market data. Our Fixed Income Data and Analytics services compete with information obtained from informal industry relationships and sources, such as broker quotes, as well as other index and portfolio analytics providers. Our ICE Global Network business competes with other extranet providers. 
 Mortgage Technology Segment 
 In our ICE Mortgage Technology business, we compete with other digital mortgage solution providers and proprietary systems that lenders have put in place. We also compete for mortgage activity that does not utilize digital solutions. 
 
 Our Growth Strategy 
 We seek to advance our leadership position by focusing our efforts on the following key strategies for growth: 
 innovate and expand the networks we serve to address the rising demand for transparency and efficiency; 
 further develop our technology and risk management infrastructure while also increasing our distribution; and 
 strengthen our competitive position through select acquisitions and strategic relationships. 
 The record consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, we achieved in 2022 reflect our focus on the implementation and execution of our long-term growth strategy. 
 Innovate and Expand the Networks We Serve to Address the Rising Demand for Transparency and Efficiency 
 Our growth strategy has been to expand the networks we serve by, in part, adding new data, technology, connectivity and other workflow tools. By bringing together leading technology with a wide range of data and analytics, as well as an array of delivery mechanisms, we offer customers a comprehensive and flexible solution to address the need for more transparency, efficiency and information across their respective workflows. Our growth has been driven by many factors, such as increased automation, regulation and demand for independent, secure, real-time information. 
 We will continue to look for strategic opportunities to grow our networks and expect to also continue to pursue opportunities in asset classes we do not currently serve. 
 Further Develop Our Technology and Risk Management Infrastructure While Also Increasing Our Customer Base 
 We develop and maintain our own infrastructure, electronic trading platforms, clearing systems, mortgage platforms and data and analytics platforms, which are designed to ensure scalability and the delivery of technology that meets our expanding customer base s demands for price transparency, reliability, risk management and transaction efficiency. The systems that we operate support trading, clearing, mortgage originations, data and analytics across many data centers. 
 We expect to continue to develop our exchange technologies. We also expect to continue to invest in mortgage technology to streamline and automate more workflows and build new capabilities. Finally, we expect to add content and build new analytics to enable further electronification in fixed income markets. 
 Our customer base has grown and diversified as a result of several drivers, including the addition of new asset classes and products, the move toward increased risk management and increased automation, regulation and demand for independent, secure, real-time information. We continue to add new participants to our platforms, which bring additional demand for new products and services. We develop new products, but have also increased our capabilities through licenses and acquisitions of companies and intellectual property. We intend to continue to increase the ease of access and connectivity with our existing and prospective customers and expand our customer base by leveraging our existing relationships and our global sales and marketing team to promote participation on our platform, and by expanding our range of products and services. 
 Strengthen Our Competitive Position Through Select Acquisitions and Strategic Relationships 
 We were an early consolidator in global markets and we intend to continue to explore and pursue acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position globally, broaden our product offerings and services and support the growth of our company while enhancing stockholder value as measured by return on invested capital, earnings accretion and cash flow growth. We may enter into business combinations, make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships, joint ventures or other alliances, any of which may be material. In addition to growing our business, we may enter into these transactions for a variety of additional reasons, including leveraging our existing strengths to 
 15 

enter new markets or related asset classes, expanding our products and services, diversifying our business, addressing underserved markets, advancing our technology and anticipating or responding to regulatory or other potential changes in our industry or other industries. 
 
 Information About Our Executive Officers 
 Information relating to our executive officers is included under Executive Officers in Part III, Item 10, Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance of this Annual Report. 
 
 Regulation 
 Our activities and the markets in which we operate are subject to regulations that impact us as well as our customers, and, in turn, meaningfully influence our activities, the manner in which we operate and our strategy. We are primarily subject to the jurisdiction of regulatory agencies in the U.S., U.K., EU, Canada, Singapore and Abu Dhabi. Failure to satisfy regulatory requirements can or may give rise to sanctions by the applicable regulator. See the discussion below and Item 1(A) "-Risk Factors" in this Annual Report for additional descriptions of regulatory and legislative risks and uncertainties. 
 Regulation of our Derivatives Business 
 Our regulated derivatives markets and clearing houses are based primarily in the U.S., U.K., EU, Canada, Singapore and Abu Dhabi. 
 Our U.S. futures exchange, ICE Futures U.S., is subject to extensive regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, under the Commodity Exchange Act, or CEA. The CEA generally requires that futures trading in the U.S. be conducted on a commodity exchange registered as a Designated Contract Market, or DCM. As a registered DCM, ICE Futures U.S. is a self-regulatory organization, or SRO, that has implemented rules and procedures to comply with the core principles applicable to it under the CEA. 
 In the U.K., ICE Futures Europe is a Recognized Investment Exchange, or RIE, in accordance with the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Like U.S. regulated derivatives markets, RIEs are SROs with surveillance and compliance responsibilities.

Regulation of our Securities Business 
 In our cash equities and options markets, NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE American, NYSE National and NYSE Chicago are national securities exchanges and, as such, are SROs and subject to oversight by the SEC. Accordingly, our U.S. securities exchanges are regulated by the SEC and, in turn, are the regulators of their members. As national securities exchanges, NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE American, NYSE National and NYSE Chicago must comply with, and enforce compliance by their members with, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. 
 We operate a U.S.-based execution-oriented market for the trading of securities that are not exchange-listed (OTC securities) as an ATS by our SEC-registered broker-dealer, Archipelago Trading Services. Archipelago Trading Services is subject to oversight by the SEC and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA.

Archipelago Securities, LLC is subject to oversight by the SEC and FINRA and is a full clearing member of the National Securities Clearing Corporation and Options Clearing Corporation, or OCC. 
 Our U.S.-based execution-oriented fixed income markets are operated by our SEC-registered broker-dealers, ICE Bonds Securities Corporation, or ICE Bonds, which operates two SEC registered ATSs, ICE BondPoint, and ICE TMC. ICE Bonds is subject to oversight by the SEC and is a member of FINRA and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, or MSRB. FINRA and MSRB are SROs that regulate broker-dealers in the U.S. ICE Securities Execution Clearing, LLC, a full clearing member of the National Securities Clearing Corporation, the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation and The Depository Trust Corporation, provides correspondent clearing for ICE Bonds and is subject to oversight by the SEC, FINRA and the MSRB. 
 Our U.K.-based execution-oriented fixed income market is operated by Creditex Brokerage, L.L.P., which is an operator of a multilateral trading facility, or MTF, and ICE Markets Limited, which acts as the matched principal counterparty to bond transactions arranged on the MTF operated by Creditex Brokerage. Both Creditex Brokerage and ICE Markets Limited are regulated and authorized by the U.K. s Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA. Creditex Brokerage is authorized to provide automated trading services in Hong Kong, Singapore and Switzerland and is subject to regulatory oversight by national competent authorities in each jurisdiction. 
 Regulation of our Data Business 
 We have a U.S. subsidiary that is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or the Investment Advisers Act, for its evaluated pricing and other advisory services. The Investment Advisers Act imposes numerous regulatory obligations on registered investment advisers, including those relating to the management and distribution of products and services, record-keeping, compliance oversight, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. ICE Data Services (Australia) Pty. Ltd. provides financial services in Australia and is licensed by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, or ASIC. ICE Data Desktop Solutions (Europe) Limited provides certain financial services throughout Europe and is regulated by the FCA. 
 Regulation of our Index Business 
 We have an index business, ICE Data Indices, LLC, or ICE Data Indices, which includes equity, fixed income, commodity, volatility, mortgage, sustainability and foreign exchange indices. ICE Data Indices applies the International Organization of Securities Commissions, or IOSCO, Principles for Financial Benchmarks to its indices, and is recognized as a third-country benchmark administrator by the FCA under the U.K. Benchmarks Regulation, or U.K. BMR. In addition, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, or IBA, is authorized and regulated by the FCA for the regulated activity of administering a benchmark and is authorized as a benchmark administrator under the U.K. BMR. 
 Regulation of our Mortgage Business 
 We have a mortgage technology business, ICE Mortgage Technology (formerly known as Ellie Mae), that is subject to examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, or the FFIEC, and its member agencies because it is a third-party service provider to financial institutions directly regulated by the FFIEC and its member agencies, including, among others, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB. In addition, our mortgage technology business processes a significant amount of consumer financial information on behalf of mortgage lenders and as a result is subject to a variety of U.S. state and federal regulations governing the protection of consumer financial information. 
 17 

Regulatory Changes 
 Domestic and foreign policy makers continue to review their legal frameworks governing financial markets, and periodically change the laws and regulations that apply to our business and to our customers businesses. Our key areas of focus on these evolving efforts are: 
 Policy intervention to address high energy prices . Various legislative proposals in the EU have been adopted to address high energy prices and impact ICE Endex, the primary European exchange for the benchmark European gas contract, and ICE Clear Europe, which clears ICE Endex contracts. These policy interventions include price limiting mechanisms for exchange-traded gas products and a new LNG import benchmark. In December 2022, the EU adopted a price cap on certain Dutch Title Transfer Facility, or TTF, derivatives traded on ICE Endex effective February 2023. In December 2022, a coalition of G7 and other nations set the price of certain Russian crude oil at or below 60 a barrel, which impacts the services we offer to clients. Global leaders continue to discuss the implementation of additional sanctions against Russia. 
 Recognition of our Businesses in Foreign Jurisdictions and Continued Access by Market Participants . In February 2022, the European Commission extended the temporary equivalence decision that allows continued access by EU firms to clear trades at U.K. CCPs. In March 2022, ESMA extended ICE Clear Europe's temporary recognition and tiering decision to June 2025. 
 Separately, ICE Futures Europe will continue to be able to permit access to its platform from relevant EU jurisdictions and ICE Endex will continue to be able to permit access to its platform from the U.K. The absence of an equivalence decision by the EU for U.K. trading venues, however, may result in increased costs for certain EU market participants, which could impact trading on ICE Futures Europe. Additional impacts to our business and the potential for regulatory changes remain uncertain at this time. 
 Changes to EU Regulation of Clearing Services . In December 2022, the European Commission published legislative proposals on clearing services, amending the European Markets Infrastructure Regulation, or EMIR. The European Commission aims to encourage clearing in the EU and reduce exposure to non-EU CCPs, potentially impacting the clearing of certain Euribor contracts at ICE Clear Europe. 
 CCP Resolution . In March 2022, the U.K. Treasury published a feedback statement and status update on its plans to enhance the U.K.'s regime for resolution of CCPs in the event that they fail. This is intended to expand the prior regime which was not in line with U.K. Financial Stability Board guidance issued subsequently. Many of the parameters of the new regime have yet to be finalized and will be subject to a consultation process by the BOE which will be the resolution authority for CCPs in the U.K. However, the parameters will include increased CCP contributions (known as "second skin in the game") to the default fund. 
 Benchmarks Regulation. The FCA used its legal powers under the U.K. BMR to require IBA, as the administrator of London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, to publish certain Sterling and Japanese Yen LIBOR settings under a changed "synthetic" methodology until the end of 2022. "Synthetic" Japanese Yen LIBOR settings ceased to be published at the end of 2022, and the FCA is requiring IBA to continue publishing 1- and 6-month "synthetic" Sterling LIBOR until the end of March 2023 and intends to require IBA to publish 3-month "synthetic" Sterling LIBOR until the end of March 2024. Any settings published under the synthetic methodology are not representative of the underlying market or economic reality the setting is intended to measure as those terms are used in the U.K. BMR. The FCA has confirmed that it expects the U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings currently published on a representative basis to continue to be published until the end of June 2023. The FCA is proposing to require IBA to publish the 1-, 3- and 6- month U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings, until the end of September 2024 under a changed synthetic methodology. Usage of the "synthetic" LIBOR and continuing U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings may be restricted or prohibited in certain circumstances under applicable law. 
 The European Commission used its powers under the EU Benchmarks Regulation, or EU BMR, to designate replacement benchmarks for certain Swiss franc LIBOR settings. The European Commission intends to extend that transition period for the use of benchmarks provided by third-country administrators until December 31, 2025. In May 2022, the European Commission published a consultation on the scope of the EU BMR and the regime for third-country benchmark administrators in preparation of the development of a legislative proposal. 
 U.S. Listing and Trading Prohibitions on Certain Foreign Companies. The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or HFCAA, requires the SEC to identify any company that retains a registered public accounting firm located in a foreign jurisdiction and that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, is unable to inspect or investigate because of a position taken in such foreign jurisdiction. After three years of non-inspection, the SEC is required to prohibit the trading of the securities of identified issuers on a U.S. securities exchange or in any over-the-counter market in the U.S. In December, the PCAOB announced that it was able to inspect audit firms for 
 18 

the Chinese and Hong Kong issuers the SEC had previously identified as using non-inspected audit firms. As a result, trading in these companies securities will not be suspended and the three-year period in the HFCAA resets. 
 U.S. Equity Market Proposals. The SEC proposed significant changes to the rules governing securities trading that would impact the way in which ICE s securities exchanges are able to compete with other execution venues. 
 See the discussion below and Item 1(A) - Risk Factors in this Annual Report for additional description of regulatory and legislative risks and uncertainties.

 ITEM 1(A). RISK FACTORS 
 
 The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe could materially adversely affect us. Other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently consider to be material or of which we are not presently aware may become important factors that affect us in the future. If any of the risks discussed below actually occur or continue to occur, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Accordingly, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report. 
 SUMMARY 
 The following summarizes some of the key risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect us. You should read this summary together with the more detailed description of each risk factor contained below. 
 Business and Industry 
 Global economic, political and financial market events or conditions may negatively impact our business. 
 Owning clearing houses exposes us to risks, including risks related to defaults by clearing members, risks related to investing margin and guaranty funds and the cost of operating the clearing houses. 
 A decline in the value of securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions by our clearing houses or default by a sovereign government issuer could pose additional risks of default by clearing members. 
 Owning and operating cash equity and options exchanges exposes us to additional risks, including the regulatory responsibilities to which these businesses are subject. 
 Our business is subject to the impact of interest rate levels, inflation and financial markets volatility, which may be caused by conditions that are beyond our control. 
 Systems failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry and mortgage technology industry could negatively impact us. 
 We may be at greater risk from terrorism, including cyberterrorism, than other companies. 
 Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results. 
 19 

We may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively. 
 We may not be successful in offering new products or technologies or in identifying opportunities. 
 Climate change and the transition to renewable energy pose operational, commercial, regulatory and financial risks. 
 We may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill, other intangible assets or investments. 
 We may not realize the expected benefits of our majority investment in Bakkt and the investment may introduce additional risks to our business due to its evolving business model. 
 Pandemics or other public health emergencies, including the emergence of new COVID-19 variants resulting in another pandemic, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Legal and Regulatory 
 Our businesses and those of many of our clients have been and continue to be subject to extensive legislation and regulatory scrutiny, and we face the risk of changes to our regulatory environment and business in the future. 
 Our compliance and risk management methods, as well as our fulfillment of our regulatory obligations, might not be effective, which could lead to enforcement actions by our regulators. 
 Regulatory developments or court rulings may have an adverse impact on our ability to derive revenue from market data and connectivity fees. 
 The uncertainty surrounding the U.K. and EU regulatory frameworks following the U.K.'s exit from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit, could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Risks relating to the administration of benchmarks and indices, including LIBOR, and the potential for changes to, cessations of, and the replacement of, or transition from, benchmarks and indices, including LIBOR, may result in legal risks and could adversely affect our business. 
 We may face liability for content contained in our data products and services. 
 We are subject to significant litigation and liability risks. 
 Operational and Liquidity 
 Our systems and those of our third-party service providers are vulnerable to cyberattacks, hacking and other cybersecurity risks, which could result in wrongful manipulation, disclosure, destruction, or use of our information or that of a third party, or which could make our participants unable or reluctant to use our electronic platforms. 
 Our business has in the past been, and may in the future be, harmed by computer and communication systems failures and delays. 
 An interruption or cessation of an important service, data or content supplied by any third party, or the loss of an exclusive license, could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Our success largely depends on key personnel, including our senior management, and having adequate succession plans in place. We may not be able to attract, retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business, which could harm our business. 
 We currently have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and restrict our activities or our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations. 
 Competition 
 We face intense competition; failure to keep up with rapid changes in technology and client preferences could negatively impact our competitive position. 
 Damage to our reputation could damage our business. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our use of "open source" software could negatively impact our ability to sell our products and services and subject us to litigation. 
 A failure to protect our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, could adversely affect our business. 
 Common Stock 
 We are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends, distributions and other payments. 
 20 

We may fail to complete or realize the anticipated cost savings, growth opportunities and synergies and other benefits anticipated from our acquisitions or anticipated growth opportunities or expected benefits of our strategic investments, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. 
 Provisions of our organizational documents and Delaware law may delay or deter a change of control of ICE. 
 Black Knight Acquisition 
 The merger will not be completed unless important conditions are satisfied or waived, including regulatory approvals. 
 Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated, that could have an adverse effect on ICE following the merger or that are otherwise unacceptable to ICE. 
 We may be unable to successfully integrate Black Knight s business and realize the anticipated benefits of the merger, and we will incur significant costs in connection with the merger and the integration of Black Knight. 
 As a result of the merger, we will be subject to risks relating to the business conducted by Black Knight. 
 After the completion of the merger, we will be more leveraged than we currently are, and the financing arrangements that we will enter into will contain restrictions and limitations that could, under certain circumstances, have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. 
 BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY 
 Global economic, political and financial market events or conditions may negatively impact our business. 
 Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including recessions, inflation, supply chain issues, labor shortages, government shutdowns, currency fluctuations, interest rate changes, increased mortgage foreclosure volume, decreased mortgage origination volume, geopolitical events or conflicts, international trade disputes, including the imposition of tariffs or other protectionist measures, actual or anticipated large-scale defaults or failures or slowdown of global trade have in the past negatively impacted consumer and corporate confidence and resulted in reductions in consumer, government and corporate spending, and could have such effects in the future, and in turn impact our business. If our customers reduce spending, workforce, mortgage origination activity, trading activity or demand for financial data as a result of challenges in the prevailing economic markets, our revenues could decline. 
 During 2022, macroeconomic conditions, including rising interest rates, recent spikes in inflation rates and market volatility, along with geopolitical concerns, including the war in Ukraine and the sanctions and other measures that have been and continue to be imposed in response to the war, created economic and political uncertainty and volatility in global markets, resulted in a dynamic operating environment and impacted our operations and results, and these impacts may continue in 2023. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has been the catalyst for an energy crisis in Europe. Our customers and members are experiencing liquidity stress, particularly in the energy industry, and the risk of default has increased. Government interventions related to the energy crisis that have been enacted or that have been proposed could also have a negative impact on our business. 
 In addition, U.S. trade and diplomatic tensions, including U.S. government policies toward China and Chinese government policies toward the U.S., are likely to impact our existing business and future opportunities. For example, in response to a 2020 executive order by President Trump and the June Order by President Biden in 2021, the NYSE delisted four Chinese telecommunications companies identified in those executive orders. In addition, the HFCAA, enacted in December 2020, requires the SEC to suspend trading in the U.S. of any company whose accounting firm the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate for three consecutive years. Though, in December, the PCAOB announced that it was able to inspect audit firms for the Chinese and Hong Kong issuers the SEC had previously identified as using non-inspected audit firms, thus resetting the three-year period in the HFCAA. There remains the risk that in the future the SEC may suspend trading of NYSE-listed companies under this Act, which would require us to suspend trading for those companies to comply with U.S. government policies, which could impact our business. 
 A substantial portion of our revenues are derived from data services fees and fees for transactions executed and cleared in our markets. Our market data-based revenues are largely subscription-based, or recurring, and are generated from a range of global financial and commodity markets, including pricing and reference data, exchange data, analytics, feeds, index services, desktops and connectivity solutions. For our transaction-based revenues, we derive a significant percentage from trading in global energy and agricultural-related futures and options contracts, as well as equity transactions and global interest rate contracts. The market data subscriptions and trading volumes in our markets could decline substantially if our market participants reduce their level of spending or trading activity for any reason, including: 
 21 

adverse market conditions that curtail the addition of new customers or cause a decrease in purchases by our existing customers for our subscription-based products and services; 
 weakness in the macroeconomic environment that causes our customers to delay or cancel existing orders or subscriptions; 
 cost-cutting pressures across the industry or decrease in demand for our subscription-based products and services that lead to a reduction in price; 
 consolidation in our markets or the markets of our customers that results in a reduction in the number of market participants; 
 a reduction in trading demand by customers or a decision to curtail or cease hedging or speculative trading; 
 regulatory or legislative changes impacting our business, our customers and financial markets; 
 political uncertainty and discord could negatively impact us if we are viewed as taking a political stance that is contrary to our customers' beliefs or principles; 
 the impact of climate change and the transition to renewable energy and away from fossil fuels; 
 a prolonged decrease in volatility in the financial markets; 
 heightened capital and margin requirements or mandated reductions in leverage resulting from new regulations; 
 defaults by clearing or exchange members or the inability of participants to pay out contractual obligations; 
 changes to our contract specifications that are not viewed favorably by our market participants; or 
 reduced access to, or availability of, capital required to fund trading activities. 
 A reduction in our overall trading volume could render our markets less attractive to market participants as a source of liquidity, which could result in further loss of trading volume and associated transaction-based revenues. A reduction in trading volumes could also result in a corresponding decrease in the demand for our market data, which would further reduce our overall revenue. 
 Further, NYSE s revenue increases when more companies are seeking access to public markets, and on the NYSE specifically. Continued stagnation or declines in the IPO market, or issuers choosing to list on venues other than the NYSE, could have an adverse effect on our revenues. 
 In addition, adverse conditions in the residential mortgage lending industry, including a substantial or prolonged decline in mortgage lending volume or an increase in mortgage foreclosure volume, have in the past increased our costs or had an adverse effect on our revenues and may do so in the future. For example, beginning in early 2021 and through the date of this Annual Report, mortgage lending volume has decreased substantially and could continue to further decrease in the future. This decrease in lending volume has adversely affected our revenues, in particular those of a transactional nature which are directly connected to the number of loans processed using our technology. Factors that are currently adversely impacting mortgage lending volumes include increased mortgage interest rates, as well as housing affordability and availability. Additional factors that could now or in the future adversely impact mortgage lending volumes include reduced consumer and investor demand for mortgages, more stringent underwriting guidelines, decreased liquidity in the secondary mortgage market, high levels of unemployment, high levels of consumer debt, lower consumer confidence, changes in tax and other regulatory policies, the number of existing mortgages eligible for refinancing, and other macroeconomic factors. 
 Owning clearing houses exposes us to risks, including risks related to defaults by clearing members, risks related to investing margin and guaranty funds and the cost of operating the clearing houses. 
 There are risks inherent in operating clearing houses, including exposure to the market and counterparty risk of clearing members, market liquidity risks, defaults by clearing members and risks associated with custody and investing margin or guaranty fund assets provided by clearing members to our clearing houses, which could subject our business to substantial losses. For example, clearing members in ICE Clear Europe have provided margin and guaranty funds with an aggregate cash balance of 105.4 billion as of December 31, 2022 and a total of 147.4 billion for all of our clearing houses as of December 31, 2022. In addition to the use of Sovereign Central Bank access when applicable, the ICE Clearing Houses may use third-party investment advisors for investment of cash assets, subject to the guidelines provided by each clearing house, and may add or change the investment managers from time to time. To the extent available, ICE Clear Credit holds the U.S. dollar cash and U.S. Treasuries that clearing members transfer to satisfy their original margin and guaranty fund requirements at its account at the Federal Reserve. With respect to other clearing member cash posted, ICE Clear Credit currently self-manages and uses external investment managers to invest such cash margin and guaranty fund deposits. 
 22 

We have an obligation to return margin payments and guaranty fund contributions to clearing members to the extent that the relevant member s risk based on its open contracts to the clearing house is reduced. If a number of clearing members substantially reduce their open interest or default, the concentration of risks within our clearing houses will be spread among a smaller pool of clearing members, which would make it more difficult to absorb and manage risk in the event of a further clearing member s default. 
 Although our clearing houses have policies and procedures to help ensure that clearing members can satisfy their obligations, such policies and procedures may not succeed in preventing losses after a member's or counterparty s default. In addition, although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting margins and our financial safeguards, it is a complex process and there is no guarantee that our procedures will adequately protect us from the risks related to clearing these products. We cannot assure you these measures and safeguards will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default. We have contributed our own capital to the front of the guaranty fund of the clearing houses that could be used in the event of a default. We also have default insurance that resides after and in addition to the ICE Clear Credit, ICE Clear Europe, and ICE Clear U.S. Skin In The Game contributions and before the guaranty fund contributions of the non-defaulting clearing members. Notwithstanding these actions, the default of any one of the clearing members could subject our business to substantial losses and cause our customers to lose confidence in the guaranty of our clearing houses. 
 A decline in the value of securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions by our clearing houses or default by a sovereign government issuer could pose additional risks of default by clearing members. 
 Our clearing houses hold a substantial amount of assets as margin or guaranty fund contributions, which comprise U.S. and other sovereign treasury securities. As of December 31, 2022, our clearing houses held 118.1 billion of non-cash margin or guaranty fund contributions in U.S. and other sovereign treasury securities: 91.8 billion of this amount was comprised of U.S. Treasury securities, 3.8 billion of French Treasury securities, 2.2 billion of German Treasury securities, 2.8 billion of U.K. Treasury securities and 17.5 billion of other European, Japanese, Canadian and Tri-Party Treasury securities. Sovereign treasury securities have historically been viewed as one of the safest and most liquid securities for clearing houses to hold due to the perceived credit worthiness of major governments. If there is a collapse in a specific currency relied upon by our clearing houses, our clearing houses will face significant expenses in changing their systems and such an event could cause a credit contraction and major swings in asset prices and exchange rates. To mitigate this risk, our clearing houses currently apply a discount or haircut to the market values for all sovereign securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions; however, market conditions could change more quickly than we adjust the amount of the haircuts and the haircuts could be insufficient in the event of a sudden market event. 
 If the value of these securities declines significantly, our clearing houses will need to collect additional margin or guaranty fund contributions from their clearing members, which may be difficult for the members to supply in a time of financial stress affected by an actual or threatened default by a sovereign government. If a clearing member cannot supply the additional margin or guaranty fund contributions, which may include cash in a currency acceptable to the clearing house, the clearing house would deem the clearing member in default. If any clearing members default as a result of the reduction in the value of margin or guaranty fund contributions, our clearing houses and trading business could suffer substantial losses as a result of the loss of any capital that has been contributed to the clearing house s guaranty funds and a loss of confidence by clearing members in the clearing house, resulting in a reduction in volumes of future cleared transactions. 
 Further, our clearing houses invest large sums through reverse repo transactions in connection with their clearing operations and hold sovereign securities as security in connection with such investment transactions. In the event that a reverse repo counterparty defaults, the value of the sovereign securities we hold as collateral might not be sufficient to cover our losses. Our clearing houses may also make demand deposits with banks that are secured only to the value of FDIC insurance or other national deposit guarantee schemes, which is small, and therefore, the deposits may in significant part be lost in the event one of these banks becomes insolvent. 
 Owning and operating cash equity and options exchanges exposes us to additional risks, including the regulatory responsibilities to which these businesses are subject. 
 Owning and operating cash equity and options exchanges for which the revenues are primarily derived from trading activity, market data and listing fees, exposes us to additional risks. Adverse economic conditions and legal and regulatory changes similar to those discussed elsewhere in this section could result in decreased trading volume on our exchanges, discourage or prohibit market participants from listing on our exchanges or cause them to forgo new offerings. Any of these could reduce our revenues, including market data and listing fee revenue. 
 23 

Our cash equity and options exchanges also have certain regulatory responsibilities that must be fulfilled. For example, these exchanges are responsible for enforcing listed company compliance with applicable listing standards, enforcing our members' compliance with exchange rules and federal securities laws, complying with terms of NMS Plans, filing of all material changes to exchanges' rules with the SEC, and operating our exchanges consistent with exchange rules, federal securities laws, and other applicable laws. Any failure by one of our exchanges to comply with, and enforce compliance by their members with, exchange rules and securities laws could significantly harm our reputation, prompt regulatory scrutiny, result in the payment of fines or penalties and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Our ability to do this could be impaired by, for example, SEC amendments to NMS Plans for the consolidation of market data that impede the ability of the exchanges and FINRA to discharge their legal obligations by restricting the flow of information and constraining the decision-making authority of the exchanges and FINRA. 
 We must allocate significant resources to fulfill our regulatory and self-regulatory responsibilities. The for-profit exchanges goal of maximizing stockholder value might contradict the exchanges regulatory and self-regulatory responsibilities. In addition, the listing of our common stock on the NYSE could potentially create a conflict between the exchange s regulatory responsibilities to vigorously oversee the listing and trading of securities, on the one hand, and our commercial and economic interest, on the other hand. While we have structural protections to minimize these potential conflicts, we cannot be sure that such measures will be successful. 
 Further, changes in the rules of our securities markets must be reviewed and approved by the SEC. Approval of such changes by the SEC cannot be guaranteed, and the SEC could delay either the approval process or the initiation of the public comment process. Any denial or delay in approving changes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. The SEC continues to challenge fee filings on securities market data, which has the potential to negatively impact the value of proprietary data products. 
 See Item 1 - Business - Regulation above for additional information regarding regulatory changes impacting our cash equities and options exchanges, including risks to our business associated with possible regulation of services offered by non-exchange affiliates and U.S. listing and trading prohibitions on certain foreign companies. 
 Our business is subject to the impact of interest rate levels, inflation and financial markets volatility, which may be caused by conditions that are beyond our control. 
 Trading volume in our markets and products is largely driven by the degree of volatility - the magnitude and frequency of fluctuations - in prices and levels of the underlying commodities, securities, indices, financial benchmarks or other instruments. Volatility increases the need to hedge price risk and creates opportunities for investment and speculative or arbitrage trading. Were there to be a sustained period of stability in the prices or levels of the underlying commodities, securities, indices, benchmarks or other instruments of our products, we could experience lower trading volumes, slower growth or declines in revenues. 
 In addition, interest rates are a significant factor influencing mortgage loan production volumes. Rising interest rates are likely to reduce mortgage loan production volumes, which could potentially impact our transaction-based revenues. 
 In the event that inflation continues to increase significantly and persistently, this would likely increase the cost of capital, resulting in a slowdown of the growth of early stage companies, causing companies to stay private longer. Credit health of market participants may also be impacted, increasing the risk of default or companies inability to comply with listing standards. An inflationary environment may also reduce consumer optimism resulting in lower demand for mortgage loans. 
 Factors that are particularly likely to affect price and interest rate levels and volatility, and thus trading and mortgage loan production volumes, include: 
 global economic, political and market conditions; and 
 concerns over recession, inflation, deflation, legislative and regulatory changes, government fiscal and monetary policy - including actions by the Federal Reserve and other foreign monetary units' governing bodies, and investor and consumer confidence levels. 
 Factors that are particularly likely to affect trading volumes include: 
 weather conditions including hurricanes and other significant events, natural and unnatural disasters like large oil spills that impact the production of commodities and, in the case of energy commodities, production, refining and distribution facilities for oil and natural gas; 
 24 

war, acts of terrorism and any unforeseen market closures or disruptions in trading; 
 political developments impacting international trade, including trade disputes and increased tariffs, particularly between the U.S. and China, and imposition of protectionist measures; 
 real and perceived changes in the supply and demand of commodities underlying our products, particularly energy and agricultural products, including changes as a result of technological improvements or the development of alternative energy sources; and 
 credit quality of market participants, the availability of capital and the levels of assets under management. 
 Any one or more of these factors, which are beyond our control, may reduce volumes and trading activity. Further, lower market volatility could also result in more exchanges competing for trading volumes to maintain their growth. If any of these unfavorable conditions were to persist over a lengthy period of time and trading volumes were to decline substantially and for a long enough period, the critical mass of transaction volume necessary to support viable markets could be jeopardized. Because our cost structure is largely fixed, if demand for our current products and services declines for any reason, we may not be able to adjust our cost structure to counteract the associated decline in revenues, which would cause our net income to decline. 
 Systems failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry and mortgage technology industry could negatively impact us. 
 High-profile system failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry and mortgage technology industry have in the past, and could in the future, negatively impact our business and result in a loss of confidence in our technology and our markets, regulatory investigations, fines and penalties and business activity slowdown or interruptions. Further, regulators have imposed requirements for trading platforms that have been costly for us to implement and could result in a decrease in demand for some of our services. In particular, the SEC s Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity, or Regulation SCI, and the CFTC s system safeguards regulations subject portions of our securities and derivatives trading platforms and other technological systems related to our clearing houses, trade repositories and the U.S. Swap Execution Facility, or SEF, to extensive regulation and oversight. Ensuring our compliance with the requirements of Regulation SCI and the CFTC s system safeguards regulations requires significant ongoing administrative and compliance expenses and burdens. In addition, the SEC s expansion of the ICE systems that are determined to be in scope for Regulation SCI could result in significant additional expenditures. 
 We may be at greater risk from terrorism, including cyberterrorism, than other companies. 
 Given our prominence in the global securities industry and the location of many of our properties and personnel in U.S. and European financial centers, including lower Manhattan, and our presence in India, Abu Dhabi and Israel, we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of, or an indirect casualty of, attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations, or other extremist organizations that employ threatening or harassing means to achieve their social or political objectives. 
 It is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the securities industry generally, or on our business. In the event of an attack or a threat of an attack, our security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business, technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business. Damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of insurance coverage, and we may not be able to insure against some damage at a reasonable price or at all. The threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees. In addition, terrorist attacks may cause instability or decreased trading in the securities markets, including trading on exchanges. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results. 
 Since we conduct operations in a number of countries and regions, including the U.S., U.K., EU, Canada, Asia Pacific and the Middle East, substantial portions of our revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate non-U.S. dollar denominated revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against the other currencies could affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. 
 25 

In an attempt to combat inflation, countries and regions have used monetary policy, through increasing central bank interest rates, and such actions have caused, and may continue to cause, volatility in currency exchange rates. 
 External events such as Brexit have caused, and may in the future cause, significant volatility in currency exchange rates, especially among the U.S. dollar, the British pound sterling and the euro. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in the U.K., EU, the U.S. or other key markets deteriorate, the value of the pound sterling, euro or U.S. dollar may weaken. Further, financial instability in a particular country could have a contagion effect on the region in which it is located and contribute to general instability and uncertainty in that region. Events that adversely affect our clients and suppliers in a region could in turn have a materially adverse effect on our international business results and our operating results. 
 For additional information on our foreign currency exchange rate risk, refer to - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk in Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk", which is included in this Annual Report. 
 We may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively. 
 We have achieved significant growth since becoming a public company in 2005. Our growth is highly dependent on customer demand for our core products and services, favorable economic conditions and our ability to invest in our personnel, facilities, infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls. Adverse economic conditions could reduce customer demand for our products and services, which may place a significant strain on our management and resources and could force us to defer existing or future planned opportunities. We regularly evaluate our existing operations, service capacity and business efficiencies and, as a result of such evaluations, we may undertake strategic initiatives outside of and within our businesses. We may not be successful in executing on our strategies to support our growth organically or through acquisitions, other investments or strategic alliances. 
 We may not be successful in offering new products or technologies or in identifying opportunities. 
 We from time to time launch, and intend in the future to launch, new products, services and business ventures and continue to explore and pursue other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company. We have spent and may continue to spend substantial time and money developing new product or service offerings or improving current product or service offerings. If these offerings are not successful, we may miss a potential market opportunity and not be able to recover the costs of such initiatives. Obtaining any required regulatory approval associated with these offerings may also result in delays or restrictions on our ability to benefit fully from these offerings. Further, we have entered into and may seek in the future to enter into or increase our presence in markets that already possess established competitors who may enjoy the protection of high barriers to entry, among other advantages. 
 In addition, in light of consolidation in the exchange, data services, clearing and mortgage technology sectors and competition for opportunities, we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance any future acquisition successfully. Our competitors could merge, making it more difficult for us to find appropriate entities to acquire or merge with and making it more difficult to compete in our industry due to the increased resources of our merged competitors. Also, offering new products and services and pursuing acquisitions requires substantial time and attention of our management team, which could prevent them from successfully overseeing other initiatives that are necessary for our success. 
 Climate change and the transition to renewable energy pose operational, commercial, regulatory and financial risks. 
 Climate change may increase the frequency or severity of extreme weather events, and if we are not adequately resilient to deal with acute climate events, our operations, either in a particular location or globally, may be impacted. Extreme weather events could also impact the activities of our customers or third-party vendors or suppliers. The physical commodities and assets underlying certain of our markets may also be impacted by climate change. 
 In addition, the transition to renewable energy involves changes to consumer and institutional preferences around energy production and consumption, and the possible failure of our products or services to facilitate the needs of customers during the transition to renewable energy could adversely impact our business and revenues. Changing preferences could also have an adverse impact on the operations or financial condition of our customers, which could result in reduced revenues from those customers. We are also subject to risks relating to new or heightened climate change-related regulations or legislation, which could impact us and our customers and result in increased regulatory, compliance or operational costs. We are also subject to reputational risks relating to the perception of whether or not we are facilitating a 
 26 

migration away from fossil fuels. For example, our reputation could be damaged as a result of our offering certain products or services associated with causing or exacerbating climate change, or by any decision by us to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change. 
 The risks associated with climate change and the transition to renewable energy are continuing to evolve rapidly, and we expect that climate change-related risks may increase over time. 
 We may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill, other intangible assets or investments. 
 The determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2022, we had goodwill of 21.1 billion and net other intangible assets of 13.1 billion relating to our acquisitions and our purchase of trademarks and Internet domain names from various third parties. 
 During 2022, we recorded an impairment of our equity investment in Bakkt and we cannot assure you that we will not experience future events that may result in these types of impairments. An impairment of the value of our existing goodwill, other intangible assets and other investments and assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results. 
 For additional information on our goodwill, other intangible assets and investments, refer to Notes 3, 4 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements and - Critical Accounting Policies - Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets in Item 7 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which are included in this Annual Report. 
 We may not realize the expected benefits of our majority investment in Bakkt and the investment may introduce additional risks to our business due to its evolving business model. 
 We have a majority equity ownership interest in Bakkt, which operates as a separate publicly-traded company listed on the NYSE. Due to our majority equity ownership interest in Bakkt, we have increased financial and reputational risks if there is a security or system failure, a failure to launch one or more products, or if Bakkt's business is unsuccessful. It may take longer than expected for us to realize the expected returns from this investment or such returns may ultimately be less than anticipated. In 2022, Bakkt reported an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and we recorded an impairment of our equity investment in Bakkt. Subsequent impairments on our equity investment in Bakkt may become necessary. Furthermore, our investment in Bakkt entails numerous risks, including risks relating to our minority voting interest in Bakkt and risks relating to Bakkt s ability to: 
 manage the complexity of its business model to stay current with the industry; 
 successfully enter categories and markets in which it may have limited or no prior experience; 
 apply distributed ledger technology to a global ecosystem for digital assets; 
 successfully develop and integrate products, systems or personnel into its business operations; 
 obtain and maintain required licenses and regulatory approvals for its business; 
 maintain a risk management and compliance framework designed to detect illegal activity such as fraud, money laundering, tax evasion and ransomware scams and comply with anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations and anti-corruption laws globally; 
 comply with existing or new laws, regulations or orders of any governmental authority related to the use of digital assets, which are currently under additional regulatory scrutiny following recent negative events in the cryptocurrency industry; and 
 maintain technology systems and processes that prevent cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities. 
 As digital assets and blockchain technologies evolve, Bakkt may add, modify or discontinue certain aspects of its business model relating to the product mix and service offerings. Future additions and modifications to Bakkt s business will increase the complexity of its business and place significant strain on Bakkt s management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions. We cannot offer any assurance that these or any other additions or modifications will be successful or will not result in harm to Bakkt s business. In addition, recent volatility in digital asset markets and bankruptcies relating to digital asset companies could, among other things, reduce confidence in digital assets and blockchain technologies. These events are continuing to 
 27 

develop and it is not possible to predict at this time all of the risks that they may pose to Bakkt or on the digital asset industry as a whole. 
 Pandemics and other public health emergencies, including the emergence of new COVID-19 variants resulting in another pandemic, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic created economic and financial disruptions globally and led governmental authorities to take unprecedented measures to mitigate the spread of the disease. From an operational perspective, the spread of COVID-19 resulted in, and the emergence of a new pandemic or other health emergency, including a resurgence of COVID-19, could in the future result in, temporary closures of our office facilities and the office facilities of our customers and our third-party vendors. We cannot assure you that such measures will adequately protect our business, and could introduce new operational risks, including, but not limited to, cybersecurity risk, and could strain our technological resources and business continuity plans. If one or more of the third-party vendors to whom we outsource certain material activities claim that they cannot perform due to a force majeure or experience operational failures as a result of a pandemic or other public health emergency, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The emergence of variant strains that are resistant to vaccines or a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines over the long term could impact, among other things, the availability of our executive officers, staff and primary facilities, and the viability of our customers. 
 In addition, in 2022, the spread of COVID-19 variants, along with other factors, such as restrictions and limitations on business activities, labor shortages at ports and for long-haul transportation, rising fuel costs and raw material shortages, have resulted in disruptions to global supply chains, which have impacted the availability of critical hardware and extended lead times for certain components and systems we require for our operations. A resurgence in COVID-19 cases, or another pandemic or public health emergency, could continue to negatively affect the flow or availability of certain hardware and related products for technology that we need to operate our business effectively and efficiently. Our inability to acquire suitable hardware and related products on acceptable terms or the loss of key suppliers could negatively affect our business. Pandemic and public health-related restrictions could also impact third-party providers' abilities to meet their contractual obligations to us, potentially impacting our operations. Pandemics and public health emergencies could also have an adverse impact on our customers businesses, risk management needs and ability to trade, and, to the extent they do so may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 LEGAL AND REGULATORY 
 Our businesses and those of many of our clients have been and continue to be subject to extensive legislation and regulatory scrutiny, and we face the risk of changes to our regulatory environment and business in the future. 
 We are and will continue to be subject to extensive regulation in many jurisdictions around the world, and in particular in the U.S. and the U.K. We face the risk of significant actions by regulatory and taxing authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses and hold investments, which may affect our business, the activity of our market participants, and our results. Among other things, as a result of regulators and tax authorities enforcing existing laws and regulations, we could be censured, fined, prohibited from pursuing certain acquisitions or engaging in some of our business activities, subjected to limitations or conditions on our business activities, including fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory pricing restrictions, also known as FRAND, and prohibiting the inclusion of, or reliance on, unfair terms in certain customer contracts, or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with the conduct of our business or with respect to our employees, including settlement payments, interest payments and penalty payments. In many cases, our activities may be subject to overlapping and divergent regulation in different jurisdictions. 
 The adoption of new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement practices applicable to our businesses or those of our clients could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way or impact our clients overall trading volume through our exchanges and demand for our market data and connectivity offerings, mortgage technology and other services. 
 The European Commission has adopted or proposed various options for regulatory intervention to address high energy prices including, among others, price limiting mechanisms on exchange traded gas products, the introduction of circuit breakers and the development of LNG import benchmarks. Trading volumes on ICE Endex, the primary European exchange for the benchmark European gas contract, and ICE Clear Europe, which clears ICE Endex contracts, could be impacted. Additionally, in December 2022, a coalition of various nations have set the price of Russian crude oil at or below 60 a barrel, which may impact our businesses and those of our clients. There may be additional regulatory changes forthcoming and additional impacts to our business. 
 28 

We are also subject to regulatory risks relating to the mortgage industry, which is heavily regulated in the U.S. Changes to existing laws or regulations or adoption of new laws or regulations that affect the residential mortgage industry could reduce residential mortgage volume or otherwise limit the ability of users and participants of our mortgage technology services to operate their businesses, resulting in decreased usage of our solutions. Alternatively, reduced regulatory requirements could also reduce the demand for certain of our products and services, which are intended to enable our customers to satisfy existing regulatory requirements. Potential structural changes to federal agencies integral to the U.S. residential mortgage industry, in particular, those involving the roles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in addition to the regulatory roles of the CFPB and other banking regulators, could disrupt the residential mortgage market and have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, as a critical third-party service provider in the mortgage industry, we are subject to supervision and examination by certain regulators, which has resulted in, and will continue to result in, additional operating costs. 
 There is ongoing public concern regarding data privacy and data protection in many jurisdictions in which ICE operates. Many of those jurisdictions have passed data privacy legislation, with many more contemplating new laws. The laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate, which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us. Regulation of privacy and data protection often times require monitoring of, and changes to, our data practices in regard to the collection, use, disclosure, storage, transfer and/or security of personal and sensitive information. 
 These developments could impact our profitability in the affected jurisdictions, or even make it uneconomical for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such jurisdictions, or could cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices, restructuring our businesses or moving all or certain of our businesses and our employees to other jurisdictions, including liquidating assets or raising capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs or otherwise adversely affects our stockholders and creditors. 
 U.S., U.K. and EU legal and regulatory developments, in particular EMIR, EMIR 3.0, U.K. Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, or U.K. MiFID II, and EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, or EU MiFID II, the U.K BMR and the EU BMR, including each such regulation as incorporated into U.K. law, and the Dodd-Frank Act, have significantly altered and propose to further alter the regulatory framework within which we operate and may adversely affect our competitive position and profitability. These regulatory developments could also cause us to change our business practices, restructure our businesses or move certain of our businesses and employees. The enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes most likely to affect our businesses are: non-discriminatory access provisions of U.K. MiFID II and EU MiFID II, interoperability and margin rules in EMIR, enhanced regulatory capital liquidity and leverage rules in Basel III and Capital Requirements Directive IV, access rules under the U.K. BMR and EU BMR, the non-harmonization of margin requirements, access to our benchmarks, U.K. CCP resolution enhancements and maintaining our exchanges abilities to operate as SROs with related immunity for the discharge of their regulatory functions. In addition, as the EU and U.K. amend legislation and regulation post-Brexit, there is a risk of increased divergence between the EU and U.K. regulatory regimes. As the operator of global businesses, the lack of harmonization in international financial reform efforts could impact our business as our clearing houses and exchanges are subject to regulation in multiple jurisdictions. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act established enhanced regulatory requirements for non-bank financial institutions designated as systemically important by the FSOC. ICE Clear Credit has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility by the FSOC and, as a result, is subject to additional oversight by the CFTC. Compliance with these requirements has resulted in, and will continue to result in, additional operating costs. 
 In 2016, the SEC approved a plan to establish a market-wide consolidated audit trail, or CAT, to improve regulators ability to monitor trading activity. In 2018, the first phase of implementation went live and required SRO participants to begin reporting to the CAT. In addition to increased risk in connection with our regulatory obligations and implementation of the CAT could result in significant additional expenditures, which may not be reimbursed. Funding of the implementation and operation of the CAT is ultimately expected to be provided by both the SROs and broker-dealers. To date, however, funding has been provided solely by the SROs, partly in exchange for promissory notes, which increases the risk that SROs, including us, will not be reimbursed for costs expended to date. Due to the replacement of the original plan processor, we recorded promissory note impairment charges of 2 million and 16 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Because the SEC has not approved a funding model that shares the cost of the CAT between SROs and broker-dealers, we believe there is a risk that SROs are not reimbursed, resulting in this impairment. Until the SEC approves a funding model, the SROs will continue to incur additional costs, which may become significant and may not be reimbursed. As of December 31, 2022, we have accrued approximately 83 million as a receivable in connection with our portion of expenses related to the CAT implementation. In addition, there are additional risks to SRO participants related to regulatory actions or fines in connection with a delay in implementation of the CAT. 
 29 

There is an increased focus on, and scrutiny of, ESG data and ratings providers by regulators and policymakers. Regulators and policymakers have indicated that extension of their regulatory oversight to ESG data service providers is possible. This could result in new or additional regulations applicable to our ESG data products and services which could result in additional operating costs. 
 We are subject to tax laws, regulations, rulings and audits in multiple U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions that could have a significant impact on our business and lead to additional expenditures for us or our customers. For example, there have been discussions in various jurisdictions around financial transaction or digital service tax frameworks as well as global minimum corporate income tax rates. Changes to tax frameworks in jurisdictions where we operate significant business, for example, the U.S., the U.K. and the EU have the potential to increase costs to us or to our market participants and discourage participation in the markets we operate. Furthermore, implementation of any new or amended tax laws or regulations could impact our global operations, trading volumes or financial results. 
 Other enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes not discussed above may also adversely affect our competitive position and profitability. See Item 1 - Business - Regulation above for additional information regarding the current and proposed laws and regulations that impact our business, including risks to our business associated with these laws and regulations. 
 Our compliance and risk management methods, as well as our fulfillment of our regulatory obligations, might not be effective, which could lead to enforcement actions by our regulators. 
 Our ability to comply with existing and future rules, regulations and laws largely depends on our establishment and maintenance of compliance, audit and reporting systems that can quickly adapt and respond, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel. Regulators periodically review our ability to self-regulate and our compliance with a variety of laws and regulations including self-regulatory standards. Certain of our businesses associated with the NYSE are subject to public notice procedures prior to making changes in operations, policies and procedures. If we fail to comply with any of these obligations, regulators could take a variety of actions that could impair our ability to conduct our business. 
 Our acquisitions expose us to new regulatory requirements. For example, our acquisition of the BondPoint ATS in January 2018 and our acquisition of TMC Bonds in July 2018 exposes us to increased exposure to regulatory scrutiny from the SEC, FINRA and MSRB. Our acquisition of Ellie Mae in 2020 and our pending acquisition of Black Knight exposes us to increased regulatory scrutiny from U.S. regulatory bodies that regulate the U.S. residential mortgage industry, including the FFIEC and its member agencies, and the CFPB, among others. Compliance with any such regulatory requirements gives rise to costs and expenses that may be material. 
 Our regulators have broad enforcement powers to censure, fine, issue cease-and-desist orders, embargo future business activity or prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses. We continue to face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities, including extensive examination and surveillance activity of our business. Any such matters may result in material adverse consequences to our financial condition, operating results or ability to conduct our business, including adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, restrictions on our business activities or other relief. Our involvement in any such matters, even if the matters are ultimately determined to be in our favor, could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business. Further, any settlement, consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government or regulatory agencies may result in additional litigation, investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government or regulatory agencies begin independent reviews of the same businesses or activities. Finally, the implementation of new legislation or regulations, or changes in or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies, could require us to incur significant compliance costs and impede our ability to remain competitive and grow our business. 
 Regulatory developments or court rulings may have an adverse impact on our ability to derive revenue from market data and connectivity fees. 
 Regulatory developments or court rulings could reduce the amount of revenue that we obtain from exchange market data and connectivity fees related to our U.S. equity and options exchanges. With respect to our U.S. equities and equity options exchanges, our ability to assess fees for market data products and certain connectivity fees are subject to review by the SEC. There continue to be opposing industry viewpoints as to the extent that our U.S. equities and equity options exchanges should be able to charge for market data and market access, and the manner in which we set such exchange fees could be reassessed. 
 30 

If new constraints are placed on our ability to charge for market data or market access in the U.S., it could have a negative impact on our revenues. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any regulatory or other changes will take effect or their impact on our business. A determination by the SEC or a court, for example, that the SEC must link market data fees to marginal costs, take a more active role in the market data rate-setting process, or reduce the current levels of market data fees, could have an adverse effect on our market data revenues. 
 Separately, our European exchanges are currently authorized to sell trade information on a non-discriminatory basis at a reasonable cost. This regulatory position could be modified or interpreted by the European Commission, or EC, or future European court decisions in a manner that could have an adverse effect on our European market data revenues. 
 In addition, the FCA and IOSCO have both issued consultations to explore access to market data in financial markets. The results of these consultations may lead to a regulatory response that could affect our business. Similar to the U.S., if new constraints are placed on our ability to charge for market data or market access in the U.K. or other jurisdictions, it could have a negative impact on our revenues. 
 The uncertainty surrounding the U.K. and EU regulatory frameworks following the U.K.'s exit from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit, could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Brexit has created political and economic uncertainty and instability in the global markets, particularly in the U.K. and EU. Political and economic uncertainty surrounding the future relationship of the U.K. and EU could lead to certain macroeconomic conditions that adversely affect our business. The long-term effects of Brexit will depend, in part, on the agreement the U.K. made to retain access to EU markets. The EU and U.K. continue to implement regulatory proposals related to the provision of financial services and the administration of benchmarks and indices in the EU and U.K. related to Brexit. 
 In January 2021, the U.K. completed its withdrawal from the EU. Prior to completing its withdrawal, the U.K. and EU agreed to a trade and cooperation agreement which governs the EU-U.K. relationship after the completion of the U.K. s exit from the EU. The U.K.-EU Brexit deal did not provide a transition period for financial services, or any new arrangements to replace the existing passport. This leaves both the U.K. and EU to address matters of access in financial services through declarations of equivalence under existing equivalence regimes contained in U.K. and EU law and through domestic laws. The EC has adopted an 18-month temporary equivalence decision for U.K. CCPs, which began to apply as of January 1, 2021. ICE Clear Europe has been recognized by ESMA as a third-country CCP in accordance with EMIR and in March 2022, ESMA extended ICE Clear Europe's temporary recognition and tiering decision to June 2025. 
 The U.K. launched HM Treasury's Wholesale Markets Review to improve the competitiveness of the U.K. financial services sector and in March 2022 published its consultation response and its proposals will be implemented through a combination of legislation and regulatory developments. The U.K.'s Financial Services and Markets Bill 2022-23 proposes changes to the U.K.'s financial services sector and incorporates recommendations from the Wholesale Markets Review. In parallel, the FCA has been tasked with implementing new proposals. Several of the proposals introduced by the Wholesale Markets Review seek to address developments in the U.K. economy since MiFID II was implemented. 
 In December 2022, the European Commission published new legislative proposals on clearing services amending EMIR and provisions in the framework. The European Commission aims to encourage clearing in the EU and reduce exposure to non-EU CCPs. These proposals and those mentioned above could impact our business. 
 As a result of the U.K. and EU trade and cooperation agreement not providing free trade arrangements for financial services, any equivalence determinations or any further transition period for financial services, could include restrictions on access to our services by persons located in the EU or make access more expensive, which could adversely affect our operations and profitability or even make it uneconomical for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such jurisdictions. The consequences of Brexit and the terms of the trade and cooperation agreement could also cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices, restructuring our businesses or moving certain of our businesses and our employees to other jurisdictions. See Item 1 - Business - Regulation above for additional information regarding Brexit, including risks to our business associated with Brexit. 
 31 

Risks relating to the administration of benchmarks and indices, including LIBOR, and the potential for changes to, cessations of, and the replacement of, or transition from, benchmarks and indices, including LIBOR, may result in legal risks and could adversely affect our business. 
 Certain of our subsidiaries produce and license multiple benchmarks and indices across asset classes, which are used globally and are referenced in certain of our trading and clearing products. To ensure continued trading and clearing in these benchmark-related products, and the continued licensing and use of these benchmarks and indices, our subsidiaries must be able to demonstrate that these benchmarks and indices are determined with integrity and are not readily subject to manipulation, and must also continue to evolve these benchmarks and indices as necessary to maintain their reliability and relevance and continue to administer these benchmarks and indices in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. As an example, our subsidiary, IBA, is the administrator of various global benchmarks, including LIBOR. Any failures, negative publicity or lawsuits related to our subsidiaries' administration of benchmarks and indices, including LIBOR, could result in a loss of confidence in the administration of these benchmarks and indices and could harm our business and our reputation. 
 Changes to, cessations of, and the replacement of or transition from, our subsidiaries' benchmarks and indices, including LIBOR, or any other changes or reforms to the determination or administration of such benchmarks and indices, could result in legal risks, risks to our reputation, and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. In July 2017, the FCA stated its intention that it would no longer be necessary to sustain LIBOR through its influence or legal powers beyond 2021. As a result, regulators in multiple jurisdictions have encouraged market participants to transition from using LIBOR to alternative reference rates. The publication of most LIBOR settings ceased after December 31, 2021 and certain others are scheduled to cease after June 30, 2023. 
 Additionally, the FCA is requiring IBA to publish certain LIBOR settings under a changed "synthetic" methodology, with certain settings ceased December 31, 2022 and certain others scheduled to cease after March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024. In November 2022, the FCA issued a consultation on a proposal to require continued publication of certain LIBOR settings under the synthetic methodology until September 30, 2024. Any settings published under a synthetic methodology are not representative of the underlying market or economic reality the setting is intended to measure as those terms are used in the U.K. BMR. Any failures, negative publicity or lawsuits related to our subsidiaries' administration of "synthetic" LIBOR, could result in a loss of confidence in the administration of these benchmarks and indices and could harm our business and our reputation. See Item 1 - Business - Regulation above for additional information regarding the LIBOR transition, including risks to our business associated with the LIBOR transition. 
 Under the U.K. BMR, the use of continuing LIBOR settings by U.K.-supervised entities in certain regulated contracts and instruments may be restricted or prohibited. The use of continuing LIBOR settings in jurisdictions outside the U.K. and by entities subject to the oversight of other regulatory authorities may also be restricted or prohibited by law in those jurisdictions and by the requirements of such regulatory authorities. We continue to monitor industry and regulatory developments in relation to the LIBOR transition and cessation and the resulting impacts on our business and on the markets that use the benchmark today. 
 In addition, certain regulators, including the SEC and FCA, have issued consultations to gather feedback on index provider businesses. The results of these consultations may lead to a regulatory response that could affect our business. Additional regulation on index providers in the U.S., U.K., or other jurisdictions, could have a negative impact on our revenues. 
 We may face liability for content contained in our data products and services. 
 We have been, and may in the future be, subject to claims for breach of contract, defamation, libel, copyright or trademark infringement, fraud or negligence or based on other theories of liability, in each case relating to the data, articles, commentary, ratings, information or other content we distribute in our financial data services. If such data or other content or information that we distribute has errors, is delayed or has design defects, we could be subject to liability or our reputation could suffer. We could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our corporate website or those websites that we own and operate through links to other websites. Use of our products and services as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients, or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients, may pursue claims against us for significant amounts. Any such claim, even if the outcome were ultimately favorable to us, could involve a significant commitment of our management, personnel, financial and other resources. Such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results and a negative impact on our reputation. 
 32 

In addition, we license and redistribute data and content from various third-party sources and the terms of these licenses change frequently. Our third-party data and content suppliers may audit our use of and our clients use of and payment for data and content from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including audits currently underway. Such third-party data and content suppliers have asserted and may in the future assert that we or our clients owe additional amounts under the terms of the applicable license agreements, that we inappropriately distributed the third-party data or that we or our clients used the data or content in a manner that exceeded the scope of the applicable license agreement or without a license agreement. In some instances, where we have certain commercial relationships with third-parties, we have assumed the responsibility for this third-party source liability. We have and expect to continue to spend and allocate resources to develop and acquire the use of technology and other intellectual property rights to manage these risks and track third-party data usage, but we cannot be assured that we will not incur liability. The costs and resources required to investigate any allegations could be material, and we may still be required to pay damages to or make unexpected large settlement payments to these data and content suppliers, which could also give rise to reputational harm. 
 We are subject to significant litigation and liability risks. 
 Many aspects of our business, and the businesses of our participants, involve substantial risks of liability. These risks include, among others, potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade and the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary loss to a participant or that an unauthorized trade occurred. For example, dissatisfied market participants that have traded on our electronic platforms or those on whose behalf such participants have traded may make claims regarding the quality of trade execution, or allege improperly confirmed or settled trades, abusive trading practices, security and confidentiality breaches, mismanagement or even fraud against us or our participants. In addition, because of the ease and speed with which sizable trades can be executed on our electronic platform, participants can lose substantial amounts by inadvertently entering trade orders or by entering them inaccurately. A large number of significant error trades could result in participant dissatisfaction and a decline in participant willingness to trade in our electronic markets. 
 In addition, we are subject to legal disputes that could result in the payment of fines, penalties or damages and could expose us to additional liability in the future. See Item 3 "Legal Proceedings" in this Annual Report for a general description of our legal proceedings and claims and Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for a summary of specific legal proceedings. The outcome of any of these legal proceedings that remain unresolved cannot be determined and adverse rulings in these matters could impact our financial condition and continued operations. 
 Further, we could incur significant expenses defending the claims mentioned above and any future claims, even those without merit, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. An adverse resolution of any lawsuit or claim against us, including those we are involved with due to acquisition activity, may require us to pay substantial damages or impose restrictions on how we conduct business, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, we may have to establish accruals for those matters in circumstances when a loss contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable. Any such accruals may be adjusted as circumstances change. 
 OPERATIONAL AND LIQUIDITY 
 Our systems and those of our third-party service providers are vulnerable to cyberattacks, hacking and other cybersecurity risks, which could result in wrongful manipulation, disclosure, destruction, or use of our information or that of a third party, or which could make our participants unable or reluctant to use our electronic platforms. 
 The secure transmission of confidential information and the ability to reliably transact on our electronic platforms and provide financial data services are critical elements of our operations. Some of our products and services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential client and other data, including client portfolio information or personally identifiable information. If anyone gains improper access to our electronic platforms, networks or databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify our confidential information or that of a third party. Breaches of our cybersecurity measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our clients or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data could expose us, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation, regulatory action and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. Our networks and those of our participants, third-party service providers and external market infrastructures may be vulnerable to compromise, unauthorized access, security technology failure, malware, social engineering, denial of service attacks, terrorism, ransomware attacks, supply chain attacks, firewall or 
 33 

encryption failures or other security problems resulting in loss of data integrity, information disclosure, unavailability or fraud. The financial services industry has been targeted for purposes of political protest, activism and financial gain and our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for cyberattack and other information security threats. Further, former employees of companies in the financial sector have misappropriated trade secrets or stolen source code in the past and we could be a target for such illegal acts in the future. There also may be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded systems are defective or not tested and installed properly. 
 Although we have not been subject to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents that have had a material impact on our operations or financial condition, we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity events including distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attacks, malware infections, phishing, web attacks and other information technology incidents that are typical for a financial services company of our size. For example, we experienced DDoS attempts, brand misuse, and phishing attempts directed toward employee systems and personal email accounts during 2022. While we operate an Information Security program that is designed to prevent, detect, track and mitigate cyber incidents and that has detected and mitigated such incidents in the past, we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect our business against future attacks. Any such attacks could result in reputational damage, cause system failures or delays that could cause us to lose customers, cause us to experience lower current and future trading volumes or incur significant liabilities or have a negative impact on our competitive position. In addition, given the increasing complexity and sophistication of the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or disable or degrade systems, a cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely. The extent of a particular cyber incident and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the incident may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known. While such an investigation is ongoing, we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, which may compound damages before the incident is discovered or remediated. Additionally, as threats continue to evolve and increase, and as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, we may be required to devote significant additional resources to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities, which could adversely impact our net income. 
 Further, cybersecurity threats to, and incidents involving, vendors and other third parties who support our activities - particularly those with less-sophisticated defenses - could impact us. For example, although we did not experience any material impacts from the Log4j security vulnerability that was widely publicized in December 2021, and exploited in various forms in 2022, we cannot assure you that we will not experience future events that may be material. 
 Our business has in the past been, and may in the future be, harmed by computer and communication systems failures and delays. 
 Our business depends on the integrity, reliability and security of our infrastructure which is highly dependent on our computer and communication systems. Our customers rely on us for the delivery of time-sensitive, up-to-date and high-quality financial market data, analytics and related solutions. Our timely, reliable delivery of high-quality products and services is dependent upon an array of technical production processes that enable our content delivery platforms. Our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans, including our ability to recover from the loss of one of our primary data centers, may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cybersecurity breach. Our systems, or those of our third-party providers, may fail or be shut down or, due to capacity constraints, may operate slowly, causing one or more of the following or other issues: 
 unanticipated disruption in service to our participants; 
 slower response time and delays in our participants trade execution and processing; 
 failed settlement by participants to whom we provide trade confirmation or clearing services; 
 incomplete or inaccurate accounting, recording or processing of trades; 
 failure to complete the clearing house margin settlement process resulting in significant financial risk; 
 distribution of inaccurate or untimely market data; 
 disruption to ICE Mortgage Technology and loan origination systems; and 
 financial loss to us or those who depend on our systems and data. 
 We have experienced system failures in the past due to telecommunication failures and hardware and software malfunctions and defects, and could experience future system failures due to power or telecommunications failures, human error on our part or on the part of our vendors or participants, natural disasters, fire, sabotage, hardware or software malfunctions or defects, computer viruses, cyberattacks, intentional acts of vandalism or terrorism and similar 
 34 

events. For example, on January 24, 2023, due to a system issue resulting from a manual error in configuring relevant systems at the start of the trading day, the NYSE did not conduct opening auctions in a subset of listed securities. Some of the resulting trades were later reversed under NYSE rules, and NYSE members otherwise impacted by the event have submitted claims for losses for which the NYSE may consider appropriate compensation under its rules. NYSE may also be potentially subject to additional claims from the SEC or unknown third parties as a result of this event. This January 24, 2023 NYSE system issue, and other system issues in the future, could result in damage to our business reputation and participant dissatisfaction with our electronic platform, which could prompt participants to trade elsewhere or expose us to litigation or regulatory sanctions. As a consequence, our business, financial condition and operating results could suffer materially. 
 Our regulated business operations generally require that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume. Heavy use of computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause those systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time. However, we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume without failure or degradation of performance. If we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy, our ability to maintain or expand our businesses could be adversely affected. 
 An interruption or cessation of an important service, data or content supplied by any third party, or the loss of an exclusive license, could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 We depend on a number of suppliers, such as online service providers, hosting service and software providers, data processors, data centers, software and hardware vendors, banks, local and regional utility providers, and telecommunications companies for elements of our trading, clearing, data services, mortgage technology applications and other systems. We rely on access to certain data used in our business through licenses with third parties, and we rely on a large international telecommunications company for the provision of hosting services. We also depend on third-party suppliers for data and content, including data received from certain competitors, clients, various government and public record services and financial institutions, used in our products and services. Some of this data is exclusive to particular suppliers and may not be obtained from other suppliers. In addition, our data suppliers could enter into exclusive contracts with our competitors without our knowledge. The general trend toward industry consolidation may increase the risk that these services may not be available to us in the future. If these companies were to experience difficulties, discontinue providing services to us for any reason or be unable to or fail to provide the type of service agreed to for any reason, we would likely experience significant disruption to our business and may be subject to litigation by our clients, increased regulatory scrutiny or regulatory fines or damage to our reputation. It could require a significant amount of time and additional resources to transition to new third-party service providers or to enter into new commercial arrangements in order to offset loss of services to our clients. Our third-party data suppliers perform audits on us from time to time in the ordinary course of business to determine if data we license for redistribution has been properly accounted for in accordance with the terms of the applicable license agreement. As a result of these audits, we may incur additional expenses. 
 Many of our clients also rely on third parties to provide them with systems necessary to access our trading platform. If these companies were to discontinue providing services to our clients for any reason, we may experience a loss of revenue associated with our clients inability to transact with our businesses. We hold exclusive licenses to list various index futures and options contracts. In the future, litigation or regulatory action may limit the right of owners to grant exclusive licenses for index futures and options contracts trading to a single exchange, and our competitors may succeed in providing economically similar products in a manner or jurisdiction not otherwise covered by our exclusive license. MiFID II introduced a harmonized approach to the licensing of benchmarks in Europe and the legislation requires non-discriminatory access to any benchmarks registered in Europe. If unlicensed trading of any index product where we hold an exclusive license were permitted, we could lose trading volume for these products which would adversely affect our revenues associated with the license and the related index products. 
 Our success largely depends on key personnel, including our senior management, and having adequate succession plans in place. We may not be able to attract, retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business, which could harm our business. 
 Our future performance depends, in large part, on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel, including our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. Competition for key personnel in the various localities and business segments in which we operate is intense. Our ability to attract and retain key personnel, in particular senior management, will be dependent on a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent. Current economic, market, social, and 
 35 

political conditions and the re-opening of the global economy have increased talent risk, which has led to higher employee attrition and made recruitment for certain positions more difficult, and could lead to a loss of top performers and make it more difficult to fill key positions. For example, our in-office requirements, as well as the location of our offices, and our remote working arrangements may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees, including senior management or other key employees, or may not be viewed as competitive, which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. In addition, we operate globally and geopolitical events or conflicts in the countries or regions in which we operate could lead to physical risks to our personnel and disruption to business continuity that could negatively impact our ability to execute our business strategy. There is no guarantee that we will have the continued service of key employees who we rely upon to execute our business strategy and identify and pursue strategic opportunities and initiatives. The loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel, or our inability to attract highly qualified senior management and other key personnel, could harm our business. In particular, we have to incur costs to replace senior officers or other key employees who leave, and our ability to execute our business strategy could be impaired if we are unable to replace such persons in a timely manner or at all. 
 Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. Further, changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 We currently have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and restrict our activities or our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 18.1 billion of outstanding debt. This level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt service obligations, increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our peers and restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities. As we use our available resources to reduce and refinance our consolidated debt, our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and our ability to pursue future business opportunities may be further restrained. In addition, the terms of our debt facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants, including a leverage ratio test and certain limitations on the incurrence of additional debt or the creation of liens and other matters. Further, a portion of our outstanding debt has historically been and may continue to be in commercial paper, which is subject to interest rate changes. Rising interest rates will result in an increase in our interest expense. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which could materially affect our financial condition. 
 Our long-term and short-term debt is currently rated by Moody s Investor Services and Standard Poor s. These ratings agencies regularly evaluate us and our credit ratings based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors, including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry, generally. Our credit ratings remain subject to change at any time, and it is possible that a ratings agency may take action to downgrade our credit ratings in the future. In particular, our inability to sustain our targeted level of debt on a consolidated basis may result in a downgrade of our credit ratings. A significant downgrade of our credit ratings in the future could impact customers willingness to use our clearing houses, make parties less willing to do business with us, and could negatively impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase the cost of our commercial paper and any future debt funding we may obtain. 
 COMPETITION 
 We face intense competition; failure to keep up with rapid changes in technology and client preferences could negatively impact our competitive position. 
 We face intense competition in all aspects of our business and our competitors, both domestic and international, are numerous. We currently compete with: 
 regulated, diversified futures exchanges that offer trading in a variety of asset classes similar to those offered by us, such as energy, agriculture, equity and equity index, credit, and interest rate derivatives markets and foreign exchange; 
 exchanges offering listing and trading of cash equities, ETFs, closed-end funds and other structured products similar to those offered by us; 
 market data and information vendors; 
 36 

providers of digital solutions, including providers of mortgage origination, compliance, pricing and documentation services; 
 interdealer brokers active in the global credit derivatives markets; 
 existing and newly formed electronic trading platforms, service providers and exchanges, some of which do not receive the same regulatory scrutiny as established market places; 
 other clearing houses; and 
 consortiums of our customers, members or market participants that may work together to achieve more favorable terms or pool their trading activity to establish new exchanges, trading platforms or clearing facilities. 
 Trends towards the globalization of capital markets have resulted in greater mobility of capital, greater international participation in markets and increased competition among markets in different geographical areas. Competition in the market for derivatives trading and clearing and in the market for cash equity listings, trading and execution have intensified as a result of consolidation, as the markets become more global in connection with the increase in electronic trading platforms and the desire by existing exchanges to diversify their product offerings. Finally, many of our competitors are our largest customers or are owned by our customers and may prioritize their internalization and ATS businesses ahead of their exchange-based market making business. Some of our competitors may have greater capital and resources, offer a wide range of products and services or operate under less stringent regulatory regimes than we do. 
 In the mortgage technology sector, we compete against other technology providers as well as companies that offer point of sale or web-based online loan applications services. We also compete with traditional methods of exchanging data and documents among mortgage industry participants, such as email, facsimile, phone, courier, and mail. Mortgage originators may also manually upload loan data or enter information into each investor s, lender s, or service provider s website in lieu of using our solutions. There is vigorous competition among providers of mortgage technology services, and we may be unsuccessful in differentiating our services to the extent necessary to effectively compete and may not succeed in convincing potential customers using other services or methods to switch to ours. 
 We also face pricing competition in many areas of our business. A decline in our fees due to competitive pressure or regulatory changes, the inability to successfully launch new products or the loss of customers due to competition could lower our revenues, which would adversely affect our profitability. For example, our data service offerings have benefited from a high renewal rate in its subscription-based services, but we cannot assure you that this will continue. We also cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product offerings, modify the pricing for our products or retain our current customers or attract new customers. If we are not able to compete successfully, our business could be materially impacted, including our ability to remain as an operating entity. 
 Our success depends on our ability to maintain and expand our product offerings, our customer base and our technology. To remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality, accessibility and reliability of our electronic platforms and our proprietary and acquired technology. The financial services industry is characterized by rapid technological change, change in use patterns, change in client preferences, frequent product and service introductions, the emergence of new industry standards and practices and increased consolidation through mergers and acquisitions activity that results in new competitors or expanded product offerings by current competitors. These changes could render our existing proprietary technology uncompetitive or obsolete. 
 We cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology to our clients requirements or emerging industry standards in a timely and cost-effective manner. Any failure to remain abreast of industry standards in technology and to be responsive to client preferences could cause our market share to decline and negatively impact our results. 
 Damage to our reputation could damage our business. 
 Our business is highly competitive and our customers typically have options on where to conduct their business. Our management team and business operations benefit from being highly regarded in our industry. Maintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers and investors and for maintaining our relationships with our regulators. Negative publicity regarding our company or actual, alleged or perceived issues regarding our products or services, operations, risk management, compliance with regulations, political affiliations or management team could give rise to reputational risk which could significantly harm our existing business and business prospects. 
 37 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 Our use of "open source" software could negatively impact our ability to sell our products and services and subject us to litigation. 
 We use some open-source software in our technology, most often as small components within a larger product or service, to augment algorithms, functionalities or libraries we create, and we may use more open-source software in the future. Open-source code is also contained in some third-party software we rely on. We could be subject to suits by parties claiming breach of the terms of the license for such open-source software. The terms of many open-source licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by U.S. or other courts, and these licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and services. Further, open-source licensors generally do not provide technology support, maintenance, warranties or assurance of title or controls on the origin of the software, which can also lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software. 
 A failure to protect our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, could adversely affect our business. 
 Our business is dependent on proprietary technology and other intellectual property that we own or license from third parties, including trademarks, service marks, trade names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents. We cannot assure you that the steps that we have taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary technology or intellectual property. Additionally, we may be unable to detect the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property. Our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively. Further, we have resorted to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights in the past, and may need to do so in the future, which requires significant financial and managerial resources. 
 In addition, our competitors, as well as other companies and individuals, have obtained, and may obtain in the future, patent and intellectual property rights related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer. We cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents and intellectual property rights that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services. As a result, we have in the past faced and may in the future face allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties which may be costly for us to defend against. If one or more of our products or services is found to infringe patents and intellectual property rights held by others, we may be subject to lawsuits or required to stop developing or marketing the products or services, obtain licenses to develop and market the products or services from the owners of the intellectual property or redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the third-party intellectual property. We also have in the past, and could in the future, be required to pay damages if we are found to infringe intellectual property rights held by others, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to intellectual property rights held by others, whether such licenses would be available or, if available, whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms. If we were unable to obtain such licenses, we may not be able to redesign our products or services at a reasonable cost to avoid infringement, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 COMMON STOCK 
 We are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends, distributions and other payments. 
 We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries. Our principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders, principal and interest on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock, is dividends from our subsidiaries. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by certain of our subsidiaries to us. If our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available, we may not be able to make dividend payments to our stockholders, principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 We may fail to complete or realize the anticipated cost savings, growth opportunities and synergies and other benefits anticipated from our acquisitions or anticipated growth opportunities or expected benefits of our strategic investments, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. 
 We have completed many acquisitions and plan to continue to pursue acquisitions and joint ventures, including our pending acquisition of Black Knight. The success of our acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate these businesses and realize anticipated cost savings, revenue synergies and growth opportunities. We generally set 
 38 

aggressive timelines for realizing savings, which assumes we successfully undertake a variety of actions (including, but not limited to, integrating technology, eliminating redundancies and effecting organizational restructurings) that are themselves subject to a variety of risks and may be subject to regulatory approvals that we do not control. The process of integrating acquired companies is time consuming and could disrupt each company s ongoing businesses, produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties (including inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect relationships with market participants, regulators and others), require substantial resources and expenditures and divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of the business. 
 There is also a risk that we may not integrate these acquired companies in a manner that permits our expected cost savings and revenue synergies to be fully realized in the time periods expected, or at all. In addition, a variety of factors, including but not limited to regulatory conditions, governmental competition approvals, cultural differences and difficulty integrating technology platforms, may adversely affect our ability to complete our acquisitions or realize our anticipated cost savings and synergies. 
 We may also not realize anticipated growth opportunities and other benefits from strategic investments or strategic joint ventures or alliances that we have entered into or may enter into for a number of reasons, including decline in value of the other company, regulatory or government approvals or changes, global market changes, contractual obligations, competing products and, in some instances, our lack of or limited control over the management of the business. Further, strategic initiatives that have historically been successful may not continue to be successful due to competitive threats, changing market conditions or the inability for the parties to extend the relationship into the future. 
 As a result of any future acquisition, we may issue additional shares of our common stock that dilute our stockholders ownership interest, expend cash, incur debt, assume actual and contingent liabilities, inherit existing or pending litigation or create additional expenses related to amortizing intangible assets. Further, we cannot assure you that any such financing or equity investments will be available with terms that will be favorable to us, or available at all. 
 Provisions of our organizational documents and Delaware law may delay or deter a change of control of ICE. 
 Our organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of, or unsolicited acquisition proposals for, ICE. These provisions make a change of control less likely, which may be contrary to the desires of certain of our stockholders. Many of these provisions are required by relevant regulators in connection with our ownership and operation of U.S. and European equity exchanges. For example, our organizational documents include provisions that generally restrict any person (either alone or together with its related persons) from (i) voting or causing the voting of shares of stock representing more than 10 of our outstanding voting capital stock (including as a result of any agreement by any other persons not to vote shares of stock) or (ii) beneficially owning shares of stock representing more than 20 of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock. Further, our organizational documents generally limit the ability of stockholders to act by written consent, and generally authorize our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, to issue and fix the rights and preferences of one or more series of preferred stock. In addition, provisions of Delaware law may have a similar effect, such as provisions limiting the ability of certain interested stockholders, as defined under Delaware law, from causing the merger or acquisition of a corporation against the wishes of the Board of Directors. 
 RISKS RELATING TO THE BLACK KNIGHT ACQUISITION 
 
 The merger will not be completed unless important conditions are satisfied or waived, including regulatory approvals. 
 Specified conditions set forth in the merger agreement must be satisfied or waived to complete the merger, including the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, or the HSR Act. If the conditions are not satisfied or, to the extent permitted by law, waived, the merger will not occur or will be delayed, and we may lose some or all of the intended benefits of the merger. If the merger is not completed, our ongoing businesses, financial condition, financial results and stock price may be materially and adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the merger, we will be subject to a number of risks, including (i) the market price of our common stock could decline to the extent the current market price reflects an assumption that the merger will be completed; (ii) we could owe a termination fee of 725 million to Black Knight under certain circumstances; and (iii) we will be required to pay costs relating to the merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory, financing (including the redemption by us of 5 billion of bonds at 101 of par value if the merger is not completed, as described below) and printing fees. 
 
 39 

Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated, that could have an adverse effect on ICE following the merger or that are otherwise unacceptable to ICE. 
 Completion of the merger is conditioned on, among other things, the expiration or early termination of the waiting period applicable to the consummation of the merger under the HSR Act. There can be no assurance that this condition will be satisfied on a timely basis or at all, or that, if regulatory approvals are granted, they will not result in the imposition of conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions that have the effect of preventing the completion of the merger, imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting our revenues following the merger or otherwise reducing the anticipated benefits of the merger, or result in the delay or abandonment of the merger. Under the merger agreement, we are not obligated to agree to any structural or behavioral remedy that any government entity may seek to impose. 
 Also, subject to limited exceptions, either ICE or Black Knight may terminate the merger agreement, if the merger has not been consummated on or before May 4, 2023, subject to two automatic extensions of three months each, to August 4, 2023 and to November 4, 2023, respectively, if U.S. antitrust clearance or a related law, injunction, order or other judgment, in each case whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the merger, remains outstanding and all other conditions to closing are satisfied (or in the case of conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, are capable of being satisfied if the closing were to occur on such date) at each extension date. If the closing extends beyond November 4, 2023 due to a delay in securing clearance under the HSR Act and neither party terminates the merger agreement, ICE would be subject to a special mandatory redemption feature pursuant to which ICE will be required to redeem all of the outstanding 5 billion of notes at a redemption price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the notes. ICE would then need to secure new financing to close the transaction. There can be no assurance that the new financing could be secured and if it is secured, the terms, including the interest rate, of the new financing may be less favorable to ICE when compared to the existing financing terms for the 5 billion of outstanding notes. 
 In addition, at any time before or after the completion of the merger, and notwithstanding the termination of applicable waiting periods, the applicable U.S. antitrust authorities or any state attorney general could take such action under the antitrust laws as any such party deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include, among other things, seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties. In addition, in some circumstances, a third party could initiate a private action under antitrust laws challenging, seeking to enjoin, or seeking to impose conditions on the merger. Although we are not obligated under the merger agreement to litigate to defeat such efforts to enjoin the merger under U.S. antitrust laws, we and Black Knight, at our option, may engage in litigation to obtain the clearances, consents, approvals and waivers under U.S. antitrust laws so as to enable the parties to close the merger. We may not prevail and may incur significant costs in defending or settling any such action. 
 
 We may be unable to successfully integrate Black Knight s business and realize the anticipated benefits of the merger, and we will incur significant costs in connection with the merger and the integration of Black Knight. 
 The success of the merger will depend on, among other things, our ability to successfully integrate the business of Black Knight into the ICE Mortgage Technology business in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities, realizes anticipated synergies, and achieves the projected cost savings, revenue growth and profitability targets of the combined businesses without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. There is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating an acquisition, which may involve delays or additional and unforeseen expenses. The integration and other disruptions from the merger may also disrupt our ongoing businesses. If we are not able to successfully achieve our objectives from the merger within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all, may take longer to realize than expected, and our business or stock price may be adversely affected. 
 In connection with the merger and the integration of Black Knight s business, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs. We may also incur additional costs or suffer loss of business under third-party contracts of Black Knight that are terminated or that contain change in control or other provisions that may be triggered by the completion of the merger, and/or losses of, or decreases in orders by, customers, and may also incur costs to maintain employee morale and to retain certain key management personnel and employees. These incremental transaction-related costs may exceed the savings and efficiencies we expect to achieve from the integration of the businesses. 
 
 As a result of the merger, we will be subject to risks relating to the business conducted by Black Knight. 
 Following the consummation of the merger, we will be subject to a variety of risks relating to the business conducted by Black Knight, many of which we, and more specifically, ICE Mortgage Technology, already face in our business, as 
 40 

described above. Some of the specific risks facing Black Knight include risks relating to the mortgage lending industry, including general conditions in the industry; changes in inflation rates and interest rates; changes in current or new regulations and legislation and potential structural changes in the mortgage lending industry; technology risks, including cyber security and data privacy risks relating to Black Knight s services; risks relating to intellectual property held or used by Black Knight; the ability of Black Knight to adequately compete with products or other companies, including through attracting new customers and retaining or selling additional service offerings to existing customers; risks relating to Black Knight s use of international third-party service providers and Black Knight s international operations; risks relating to Black Knight s indebtedness; risks relating to Black Knight s investment in Dun Bradstreet Holdings, Inc.; and risks relating to current and future legal proceedings or disputes involving Black Knight. In connection with any such legal proceeding or other dispute, we could incur significant expenses. An adverse resolution of any such proceeding or dispute may require us to pay substantial damages or impose restrictions on how we conduct business, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 In addition, Black Knight is and will continue to be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending. The occurrence of any of such risks could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition, business or results of operations of Black Knight, which could impair or eliminate our ability to achieve the expected cost savings and synergies from the merger on a timely basis, if ever, or could impair our ability to achieve such cost savings and synergies without adversely affecting our current revenues or investments in future growth. Additionally, such risks could impair our ability to integrate the business of Black Knight with our businesses in an efficient and timely manner, if at all. 
 
 After the completion of the merger, we will be more leveraged than we currently are, and the financing arrangements that we will enter into will contain restrictions and limitations that could, under certain circumstances, have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. 
 In connection with the merger, we have incurred approximately 5 billion of additional indebtedness in the form of senior notes and, assuming that the closing of the merger occurs in the first half of 2023, we intend to incur approximately 4 billion to 5 billion in additional indebtedness consisting of commercial paper and term loans, in order to finance a portion of the cash consideration in the merger and related transactions including, without limitation, the refinancing of certain existing indebtedness of Black Knight, and we will assume approximately 1 billion of Black Knight s outstanding senior notes. After the completion of the merger, we expect to have consolidated indebtedness of approximately 24 billion. Our increased indebtedness after the completion of the merger may have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, requiring us to use increased amounts of cash flow to service indebtedness and increasing our borrowing costs. 
 In addition, our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings, and, as a result, our cost of capital. Each of the ratings organizations reviews our ratings periodically, and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will be maintained in the future. Downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our businesses, cash flows, financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, if the merger is completed and Black Knight s senior notes are downgraded and rated below investment grade by two out of three of Moody s, S P and Fitch within 60 days following the change of control or the announcement thereof, this may constitute a change of control triggering event under the indenture governing those notes. Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event, Black Knight (or we on its behalf) would be required to offer to repurchase those notes at 101 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest. However, it is possible that Black Knight or we would not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control triggering event to make the required repurchase of notes or that restrictions in other debt instruments would not allow such repurchase. 
 We also expect that the agreements governing the indebtedness that we will incur will contain covenants that may, under certain circumstances, place limitations on certain actions that we could seek to undertake, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are subject to legal proceedings, claims and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. We establish accruals for those matters in circumstances when a loss contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable. Any such accruals may be adjusted as circumstances change. Assessments of losses are inherently subjective and involve unpredictable factors. We do not believe that the resolution of these legal matters, including the matters described in this Annual Report, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially and adversely affected by any developments relating to the legal proceedings, claims and investigations. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for a summary of our legal proceedings and claims.

The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, and may be affected by various factors, including our future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, share repurchase activity, current and future planned strategic growth initiatives, levels of indebtedness, credit ratings and other considerations our Board of Directors deems relevant.

 ITEM 6. [RESERVED] 
 
 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons. See the factors set forth under the heading Forward Looking Statements at the beginning of Part 1 of this Annual Report and in Item 1(A) under the heading Risk Factors. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for 2021 compared to 2020 refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 3, 2022. 
 Overview 
 We are a provider of market infrastructure, data services and technology solutions to a broad range of customers including financial institutions, corporations and government entities. These products, which span major asset classes including futures, equities, fixed income and U.S. residential mortgages, provide our customers with access to mission critical tools that are designed to increase asset class transparency and workflow efficiency. The majority of our identifiable assets are located in the U.S. and U.K. We report our results in the following three segments: 
 Exchanges: We operate regulated marketplaces for the listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives contracts and financial securities. 
 Fixed Income and Data Services: We provide fixed income pricing, reference data, indices, analytics and execution services as well as global CDS clearing and multi-asset class data delivery solutions. 
 Mortgage Technology: We provide a technology platform that offers customers comprehensive, digital workflow tools that aim to address the inefficiencies that exist in the U.S. residential mortgage market, from application through closing and the secondary market. 
 Recent Developments 
 Pending Acquisition of Black Knight, Inc. 
 On May 4, 2022, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Black Knight, Inc., or Black Knight, a software, data and analytics company that serves the housing finance continuum, including real estate data, mortgage lending and servicing, as well as the secondary markets. Pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 4, 2022, among ICE, Sand Merger Sub Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of ICE, or Sub, and Black Knight, which we refer to as the merger agreement, Sub will merge with and into Black Knight, which we refer to as the merger, with Black Knight surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of ICE. As of May 4, 2022, the transaction was valued at approximately 13.1 billion, or 85 per share of Black Knight common stock, with cash comprising 80 of the value of the aggregate transaction consideration and shares of our common stock comprising 20 of the value of the 
 44 

aggregate transaction consideration at that time. The aggregate cash component of the transaction consideration is fixed at 10.5 billion, and the value of the aggregate stock component of the transaction consideration will fluctuate with the market price of our common stock and will be determined based on the average of the volume weighted averages of the trading prices of our common stock on each of the ten consecutive trading days ending three trading days prior to the closing of the merger. This transaction builds on our position as a provider of electronic workflow solutions for the rapidly evolving U.S. residential mortgage industry. 
 Black Knight provides a comprehensive and integrated ecosystem of software, data and analytics solutions serving the real estate and housing finance markets. We believe the Black Knight ecosystem adds value for clients of all sizes across the mortgage and real estate lifecycles by helping organizations lower costs, increase efficiencies, grow their businesses, and reduce risk. 
 On August 19, 2022, our preliminary proxy statement/prospectus on Form S-4 was declared effective by the SEC, and on September 21, 2022, Black Knight stockholders approved the transaction. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2023 following the receipt of regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. 
 Global Market Conditions 
 Our results of operations are affected by global economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical events or conflicts. During 2022, macroeconomic conditions, including rising interest rates, recent spikes in inflation rates and market volatility, along with geopolitical concerns, including the war in Ukraine and the sanctions and other measures that have been and continue to be imposed in response to the war, created uncertainty and volatility in the global economy and resulted in a dynamic operating environment. 
 Our business has been impacted positively and negatively by these global economic conditions. For instance, due to market volatility and rising interest rates, we have seen increased trading across a number of our products, such as interest rate and equity futures, credit default swaps and bonds. Conversely, increases in mortgage interest rates in 2022 have resulted in reduced consumer and investor demand for mortgages and adversely impacted the transaction-based revenues in our Mortgage Technology segment. 
 We have suspended all services in Russia except for limited offerings to non-sanctioned entities. From an operational perspective, our businesses, including our exchanges, clearing houses, listings venues, data services businesses and mortgage platforms, have not suffered a material negative impact as a result of these events in Ukraine and the surrounding region. 
 We expect the macro environment to remain dynamic in the near-term, and we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates and inflation rates, as well as the uncertainty surrounding the extent and duration of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the impact that any of the foregoing may have on the global economy and on our business. 
 Tax Policy Changes 
 In July and August 2022, the CHIPS and Science Act, or CHIPS, and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, were signed into law. The IRA introduced a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax, or CAMT, on adjusted financial statement income for corporations with profits in excess of 1 billion, effective for tax years after December 31, 2022. While further guidance on the implementation of the CAMT is expected, we do not expect it will have a material impact to our 2023 effective tax rate. We also do not expect that CHIPS will have a material impact. The IRA also includes a stock buyback excise tax of 1 on share repurchases, which will apply to net stock buybacks after December 31, 2022. We do not expect this to have a material impact once share repurchases are resumed. 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD/G20, has proposed the introduction of a global minimum tax rate at 15 . Consultations are ongoing and while we expect increased tax compliance requirements, we do not expect a material impact to our effective tax rate given our current tax profile.

Consolidated Financial Highlights 
 The following summarizes our results and significant changes in our consolidated financial performance for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except per share amounts):

 Percentage changes in the table above deemed "n/a" are not meaningful. 
 (1) We define recurring revenues as the portion of our revenues that are generally predictable, stable, and can be expected to occur at regular intervals in the future with a relatively high degree of certainty and visibility. We define transaction revenues as those associated with a more specific point-in-time service, such as trade execution. 
 (2) The adjusted figures exclude items that are not reflective of our ongoing core operations and business performance. Adjusted net income attributable to ICE and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders are presented net of taxes. These adjusted figures are not calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. See - Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. 
 Revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased 146 million in 2022 from 2021. The increase in revenues includes 115 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the stronger U.S. dollar in 2022 from 2021. 
 Revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased 1.1 billion in 2021 from 2020. The increase in revenues includes 44 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2021 from 2020. 
 Operating expenses decreased 43 million in 2022 from 2021. The decrease in operating expenses includes 38 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the stronger U.S. dollar in 2022 from 2021. 
 Operating expenses increased 694 million in 2021 from 2020. The increase in operating expenses includes 22 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2021 from 2020. 
 Other income/(expense), net, in 2022 primarily includes our share of estimated equity method investment losses and an impairment charge on our investment in Bakkt to its fair value, of 1.4 billion, a net gain on the sale of our Euroclear plc, or Euroclear, stake of 41 million, interest income of 108 million and interest expense of 616 million. 
 Other income/(expense), net, in 2021 primarily includes our gain on the Bakkt transaction of 1.4 billion, our gain on the sale of our Coinbase Global, Inc., or Coinbase, investment of 1.2 billion, equity earnings in OCC of 51 million, estimated equity losses in our investment in Bakkt during the post-merger period of 92 million, dividend income from Euroclear plc, or Euroclear, of 60 million, a fair value adjustment gain on our Euroclear investment of 34 million and interest expense of 423 million. 
 The effective tax rate in 2022 was lower than the effective tax rate in 2021 primarily due to the deferred income tax benefit from the impairment to our equity method investment in Bakkt in the current year, and the deferred income tax expense from the U.K. tax law changes in the prior year. 
 47 

The effective tax rate in 2021 was higher than the effective tax rate in 2020 primarily due to the deferred income tax impacts resulting from the U.K. tax law changes. In 2021, the U.K. enacted a corporate income tax rate increase from 19 to 25 effective April 1, 2023. In 2020, the UK enacted a corporate income tax rate increase from 17 to 19 effective April 1, 2020. 
 Business Environment and Market Trends 
 Our business environment has been characterized by: 
 globalization of marketplaces, customers and competitors; 
 growing customer demand for workflow efficiency and automation; 
 commodity, interest rate, inflation rate and financial markets volatility and uncertainty; 
 growing demand for data to inform customers' risk management and investment decisions; 
 evolving, increasing and disparate regulation across multiple jurisdictions; 
 price volatility increasing customers' demand for risk management services; 
 increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies; 
 customers' preference to manage risk in markets demonstrating the greatest depth of liquidity and product diversity; 
 the evolution of existing products and new product innovation to serve emerging customer needs and changing industry agreements; 
 rising demand for speed, data, data capacity and connectivity by market participants, necessitating increased investment in technology; and 
 consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading, clearing and listings. 
 Recent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets, centralized clearing and access to data, all of which are important aspects of our product offering. However, some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been partially implemented are being reconsidered. In addition, some of the global regulations have not been fully harmonized and several non-U.S. regulations are inconsistent with U.S. rules. As the evolution continues, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. As a result, it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. As discussed more fully in Item 1 - Business - Regulation included in this Annual Report, Brexit, MiFID II and other regulations have resulted in operational, regulatory and/or business risk. 
 We have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or transaction activity in any one asset class. In addition, we have increased our portion of recurring revenues from 34 in 2014 to 51 in 2022. These recurring revenues include data services, listings and various mortgage technology solutions. 
 Many of the data products we sell and services we provide are required for our clients business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. We anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including the following: 
 increasing global regulatory demands; 
 greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations; 
 greater emphasis on risk management; 
 market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes; 
 the move to passive investing and indexation; 
 ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets; 
 increased automation of fixed income, mortgage and other less automated markets; 
 the development of new data products; 
 the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity; 
 new entrants; and 
 increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions. 
 We continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams, and prudently manage expenses, in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing, markets and technology solutions. 
 48 

Segment Results 
 Our business is conducted through three reportable business segments: Exchanges, Fixed Income and Data Services and Mortgage Technology. Segments are discussed more in detail in "Item 1- Business". While revenues are recorded specifically in the segment in which they are earned or to which they relate, a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of more than one segment. We directly allocate expenses when reasonably possible to do so. Otherwise, we use a pro-rata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment and serve functions that are necessary for the operation of all segments. Our segments do not engage in intersegment transactions. 
 For details on trends in recent prior-year periods, refer to our 2021 and 2020 Annual Reports on Form 10-K. 

Exchanges Segment 
 The following presents selected statements of income data for our Exchanges segment (dollars in millions):

(1) The adjusted figures in the charts above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. As a result, these adjusted figures are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See - Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. 
 Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change 2021 2020 Change Revenues: Energy futures and options 1,162 1,236 (6) 1,236 1,120 10 Agricultural and metals futures and options 235 228 3 228 245 (7) Financial futures and options 475 394 21 394 357 10 Futures and options 1,872 1,858 1 1,858 1,722 8 Cash equities and equity options 2,722 2,377 15 2,377 2,585 (8) OTC and other 429 326 31 326 296 10 Transaction and clearing, net 5,023 4,561 10 4,561 4,603 (1) Data and connectivity services 877 838 5 838 790 6 Listings 515 479 7 479 446 7 Revenues 6,415 5,878 9 5,878 5,839 1 Transaction-based expenses (1)

 (1) Transaction-based expenses are largely attributable to our cash equities and options business. 
 
 Exchanges Revenues 
 Our Exchanges segment includes transaction and clearing revenues from our futures and NYSE exchanges, related data and connectivity services, and our listings business. Transaction and clearing revenues consist of fees collected from derivatives, cash equities and equity options trading and derivatives clearing, and are reported on a net basis, except for the NYSE transaction-based expenses discussed below. Rates per-contract, or RPC, are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract, net of certain rebates. Our per-contract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, product mix, pricing, applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements, and new product introductions. 
 50 

Transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a per-contract basis and revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and product mix. We consider data and connectivity services revenues and listings revenues to be recurring revenues. Our data and connectivity services revenues are recurring subscription fees related to the various data and connectivity services that we provide which are directly attributable to our exchange venues. Our listings revenues are also recurring subscription fees that we earn for the provision of NYSE listings services for public companies and ETFs, and related corporate actions for listed companies. 
 In 2022 and 2021, 18 and 17 , respectively, of our Exchanges segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were billed in pounds sterling or euros. Due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro compared to the U.S. dollar, our Exchanges segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were lower by 87 million in 2022 from 2021. 
 Our exchange transaction and clearing revenues are presented net of rebates. We recorded rebates of 869 million and 1.0 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. We offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. Such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. The decrease in rebates is primarily due to lower volumes as compared to the prior year and the migration of Sterling futures rebates into the Sterling Overnight Index Average, or SONIA, and a change in the pricing and structure of SONIA products. 
 Energy Futures and Options: Total energy volume decreased 4 and revenues decreased 6 in 2022 from 2021. 
 Total oil futures and options volume decreased 12 in 2022 from 2021 driven, in part, by lower Gasoil volumes which are impacted by the uncertainty around Russian sanctions and the conflict in Ukraine. 
 Our global natural gas futures and options volume increased 16 in 2022 from 2021 as 2022 benefited from elevated price volatility related to geopolitical events, including the conflict in Ukraine. 
 Our environmentals and other futures and options volume decreased 12 in 2022 from 2021 with growth in U.S. environmental volumes offset by lower EU environmental volumes. 
 Agricultural and Metals Futures and Options: Total volume in our agricultural and metals futures and options markets increased 5 and revenues increased 3 in 2022 from 2021. The overall increase in agricultural volumes was due to 2022 benefiting from elevated price volatility and price inflation driving an increased need to manage risk across our commodity markets. 
 Sugar futures and options volumes increased 5 in 2022 from 2021. 
 Other agricultural and metal futures and options volumes increased 4 in 2022 from 2021. 
 Financial Futures and Options: Total volume increased 2 and revenues increased 21 in our financial futures and options markets in 2022 from 2021. Adjusting for the transition of the LIBOR-based Sterling contract to the alternative rate-based SONIA contract, which is half the notional size of the Sterling contract, total volume in our financial futures and options markets increased 19 in 2022. 2022 benefited from elevated volatility across global markets driven by geopolitical events, central bank activity and inflationary concerns. 
 Interest rate futures and options volume decreased 1 and revenue increased 23 , respectively, in 2022 from 2021. Adjusting for the transition of the LIBOR-based Sterling contract to the alternative rate-based SONIA contract, which is half the notional size of the Sterling contract, interest rate volumes increased 20 in 2022 from 2021 driven by interest rate volatility and increased speculation of central bank activity due to inflation concerns. Interest rate futures and options revenues were 292 million and 237 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Other financial futures and options volume, which includes our MSCI , FTSE and NYSE FANG+ equity index products, increased 15 and revenue increased 16 in 2022 from 2021. 2022 benefited from elevated volatility across global equity markets driven by geopolitical events, central bank activity and inflationary concerns. Other financial futures and options revenues were 183 million and 157 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Cash Equities and Equity Options: Cash equities volume increased 4 in 2022 from 2021 due to higher market volumes driven by elevated volatility related to inflationary, recessionary and geopolitical concerns. Cash equities revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were 275 million and 246 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Equity options volume increased 6 in 2022 from 2021 driven by increased participation and higher market share. 
 51 

Equity options revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were 103 million and 109 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 OTC and Other: OTC and other transactions include revenues from our OTC energy business and other trade confirmation services, as well as interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. Our OTC and other revenues increased 31 in 2022 from 2021 primarily due to an increase in interest income on clearing margin deposits. Following the October 2021 Bakkt transaction, Bakkt revenues are no longer included within our OTC and other revenues. 
 Data and Connectivity Services: Our data and connectivity services revenues increased 5 in 2022 from 2021. The increase in revenue was driven by the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers and increased purchases by existing customers. 
 
 Listings Revenues: Through NYSE, NYSE American and NYSE Arca, we generate listings revenue related to the provision of listings services for public companies and ETFs, and related corporate actions for listed companies. Listings revenues increased 7 in 2022 from 2021, driven by the full impact of strong equity capital markets activity in 2021. 
 Listings revenues in our securities markets arise from fees applicable to companies listed on our cash equities exchanges original listing fees and annual listing fees. Original listing fees consist of two components: initial listing fees and fees related to corporate actions. Initial listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. All listings fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time. Revenue related to the investor relations performance obligation is recognized ratably over the period these services are provided, with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges. 
 In addition, we earn corporate actions-related listing fees in connection with actions involving the issuance of new shares, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions. Listings fees related to other corporate actions are considered contract modifications of our listing contracts and are recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges. 
 In 2022, NYSE listed over 345 billion in total market value from IPOs, including three of the top five operating company IPOs defined by offering proceeds raised, follow-on offerings and over 30 transfers from competing exchanges, an increase of 56 from 221 billion raised in 2021.

 Open interest is the aggregate number of contracts (long or short) that clearing members hold either for their own account or on behalf of their clients. Open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently open, in other words, contracts that have been entered into but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade, exercise, expiration or assignment. Open interest is also a measure of the future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and their clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange.

 Handled volume represents the total number of shares of equity securities, ETFs and crossing session activity internally matched on our exchanges or routed to and executed on an external market center. Matched volume represents the total number of shares of equity securities, ETFs and crossing session activity executed on our exchanges. 
 Transaction-Based Expenses 
 Our equities and equity options markets pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Exchange Act. Section 31 fees are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. These Section 31 fees are assessed to recover the government s costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and professionals and are subject to change. We, in turn, collect corresponding activity assessment fees from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the equities and options exchanges, and recognize these amounts in our transaction and clearing revenues when invoiced. The activity assessment fees are designed to equal the Section 31 fees. As a result, activity assessment fees and the corresponding Section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income, although the timing of payment by us will vary from collections. Section 31 fees were 499 million and 248 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in Section 31 fees was primarily due to an increase in rates. The fees we collect are included in cash at the time of receipt and we remit the amounts to the SEC semi-annually as required. The total amount is included in accrued liabilities and was 223 million as of December 31, 2022. 
 We make liquidity payments to cash and options trading customers, as well as routing charges made to other exchanges which are included in transaction-based expenses. We incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our securities exchanges. In that case, we route the customer s order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. The external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. We record routing charges on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. Cash liquidity payments, routing and clearing fees were 1.8 billion in both 2022 and 2021.

 In the table above, we consider fixed income data and analytics revenues and other data and network services revenues to be recurring revenues. 
 In 2022 and 2021, 11 and 14 , respectively, of our Fixed Income and Data Services segment revenues were billed in pounds sterling or euros. As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. Due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro compared to the U.S. dollar during 2022, our Fixed Income and Data Services revenues were lower by 28 million in 2022 than in 2021. 
 Fixed Income and Data Services Revenues 
 Our Fixed Income and Data Services revenues increased 11 in 2022 from 2021 primarily due to strength in our fixed income execution and CDS clearing businesses due to elevated volatility across global markets driven by geopolitical events, central bank activity and inflationary concerns. 
 Fixed Income Execution: Fixed income execution includes revenues from ICE Bonds. Execution fees are reported net of rebates, which were nominal in 2022 and 2021. Our fixed income execution revenues increased 96 in 2022 from 2021 due to elevated volatility across global markets driven by geopolitical events, central bank activity and inflationary concerns. 
 CDS Clearing: CDS clearing revenues increased 59 in 2022 from 2021. The notional value of CDS cleared was 23.8 trillion and 17.0 trillion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increases in the notional value of CDS cleared were primarily driven by heightened volatility related to geopolitical events and inflationary concerns. 
 Fixed Income Data and Analytics: Our fixed income data and analytics revenues increased 1 in 2022 from 2021. The increase in revenues was due to strength in our index business during the first half of 2022 and continued growth in our pricing and reference data business driven by the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers, and increased purchases by existing customers. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from fluctuations of the U.S. dollar as compared to 2021. 
 Other Data and Network Services: Our other data and network services revenues increased 6 in 2022 from 2021. The increase in revenues was driven primarily by growth in our ICE Global Network offering, coupled with increased demand and strong retention in our consolidated feeds business, and strength in our derivatives analytics and desktop revenues. 
 Annual Subscription Value, or ASV, represents, at a point in time, the data services revenues, which includes Fixed Income Data and Analytics as well as other data and network services, subscribed for the succeeding 12 months. ASV does not include new sales, contract terminations or price changes that may occur during that 12-month period. However, while it is an indicative forward-looking metric, it does not provide a precise growth forecast of the next 12 months of data 
 57 

services revenues. Management considers ASV metrics when making financial and operating decisions, and believes ASV is useful for management and investors in understanding our data services business performance. 
 As of December 31, 2022, ASV was 1.682 billion, which increased 2.2 compared to the ASV as of December 31, 2021. ASV represents nearly 100 of total data services revenues for this segment. This does not adjust for year-over-year foreign exchange fluctuations.

 In the table above, we consider subscription fee and certain other revenues to be recurring revenues. Each revenue classification above contains a mix of recurring and transaction revenues, based on the various service offerings described in more detail below. 
 Mortgage Technology Revenues 
 Our mortgage technology revenues are derived from our comprehensive U.S. residential mortgage platform. Our mortgage technology business is intended to enable greater workflow efficiency for customers focused on originating U.S. residential mortgage loans. Mortgage technology revenues decreased 278 million or 20 in 2022 from 2021 primarily due to lower mortgage origination volumes driven by rising interest rates. 
 Origination technology: Our origination technology revenues decreased 22 in 2022 from 2021 due to lower transaction-based revenues as mortgage origination volumes declined during 2022. Our origination technology acts as a system of record for the mortgage transaction, automating the gathering, reviewing, and verifying of mortgage-related information and enabling automated enforcement of rules and business practices designed to help ensure that each completed loan transaction is of high quality and adheres to secondary market standards. These revenues are based on recurring Software as a Service, or SaaS, subscription fees, with an additive transaction-based or success-based pricing fee as lenders exceed the number of loans closed that are included with their monthly base subscription. 
 In addition, the ICE Mortgage Technology network provides originators connectivity to the mortgage supply chain and facilitates the secure exchange of information between our customers and a broad ecosystem of third-party service providers, as well as lenders and investors that are critical to consummating the millions of loan transactions that occur on our origination network each year. Revenue from the ICE Mortgage Technology network is largely transaction-based. 
 Closing solutions: Our closing solutions revenues decreased 26 in 2022 from 2021 due to lower mortgage origination volumes. Our closing solutions connect key participants, such as lenders, title and settlement agents and individual county recorders, to digitize the closing and recording process. Closing solutions also include revenues from our MERSCORP Holdings, Inc., or MERS database, which provides a system of record for recording and tracking changes and servicing rights and beneficial ownership interests in loans secured by U.S. residential real estate. Revenues from closing solutions are largely transaction-based and are based on the volume of loans closed. 
 Data and Analytics : Our Data and Analytics revenues increased 24 in 2022 from 2021 due to the addition of new customers in our Automation, Intelligence, Quality, or AIQ, and data businesses. Revenues include those related to ICE Mortgage Technology s AIQ offering, which applies machine learning to the entire loan origination process, offering customers greater efficiency by streamlining data collection and validation through our automated document recognition and data extraction capabilities. AIQ revenues can be both recurring and transaction-based in nature. In addition, our data offerings include real-time industry and peer benchmarking tools, which provide originators a granular view into the real-time trends of the U.S. residential mortgage market. We also provide a Data as a Service, or DaaS, offering through private data clouds for lenders to access their own data and origination information. Revenues related to our data products are largely subscription-based and recurring in nature. 
 60 

Other: Other revenues decreased 3 in 2022 from 2021 due to lower professional services and non-mortgage consumer engagement revenue. Other revenues include professional services fees, as well as revenues from ancillary products. Other revenues can be both recurring and transaction-based in nature. 
 Operating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating Margin

 62 

The majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our volume and revenues, except for certain technology and communication expenses, including data acquisition costs, licensing and other fee-related arrangements and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our data sales or overall financial performance. 
 We expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with the growth of our business, and to vary from year-to-year based on the type and level of our acquisitions, integration of acquisitions, and other investments. 
 In 2022 and 2021, 9 and 10 , respectively, of our operating expenses were incurred in pounds sterling or euros. Due to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar compared to the pound sterling and euro, our consolidated operating expenses were 38 million lower in 2022 than in 2021. See Item 7(A) - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk below for additional information. 
 Compensation and Benefits Expenses 
 Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and individual employee performance. The performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. Therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year-to-year based on our financial performance and fluctuations in our number of employees. The below chart summarizes the significant drivers of our compensation and benefits expense results for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except employee headcount). 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change Employee headcount 8,911 8,858 1 Stock-based compensation expenses 149 155 (4) 
 Employee headcount increased in 2022 from 2021 primarily due to recent acquisitions and a shift to move certain costs in-house, primarily in India. 
 Compensation and benefits expense decreased 55 million in 2022 from 2021 primarily due to 54 million in expenses related to Bakkt prior to deconsolidation in 2021. Compensation expense includes higher costs from increased headcount, annual merit increases and other related costs, offset by lower bonus expense in 2022 due to lower target performance as compared to the above-target performance in 2021. Stock-based compensation expenses decreased in 2022 due to the deconsolidation of Bakkt and lower target performance in 2022 as compared to the above-target performance in 2021. 
 Professional Services Expenses 
 Professional services expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor, as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees, and may fluctuate as a result of changes in our use of these services in our business. 
 Professional services expenses decreased 28 million in 2022 from 2021 primarily due to lower regulatory and litigation expenses, lower consulting expenses related to bringing certain mortgage technology-related costs in-house, and 13 million in expenses recorded at Bakkt in 2021 prior to deconsolidation. 
 Acquisition-Related Transaction and Integration Costs 
 In 2022, we incurred 93 million in acquisition-related transaction costs primarily due legal and consulting expenses related to our pending acquisition of Black Knight and our integration of Ellie Mae. 
 We expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. As a result, we may incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods. 
 63 

Technology and Communication Expenses 
 Technology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology and cybersecurity. These costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. Communication expenses consist of costs for network connections for our electronic platforms and telecommunications costs. 
 Technology and communications expense also includes fees paid for access to external market data, licensing and other fee agreement expenses. Technology and communications expenses may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly. 
 Technology and communications expenses increased by 17 million in 2022 from 2021, primarily due to increased hardware and software support costs, increased hosting costs and increased data services costs, partially offset by 11 million in expenses in 2021 related to Bakkt prior to deconsolidation. 
 Rent and Occupancy Expenses 
 Rent and occupancy expense relates to leased and owned property and includes rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. We have significant operations located in the U.S., U.K., and India, with smaller offices located throughout the world. 
 Rent and occupancy expenses included decreased rent expense in 2022 from 2021 due to office closures, and expenses in 2021 related to Bakkt prior to deconsolidation. These costs were partially offset by higher costs related to utilities, repairs and maintenance as more employees returned to the office. See Item 2 - Properties above for additional information regarding our leased and owned property. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses include marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, bank service charges, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, non-income taxes and other general and administrative costs. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2022 from 2021, primarily due to increased marketing expenses related to additional branding efforts and increased travel and entertainment expenses compared to suppressed travel demand in 2021 as a result of COVID-19. These were partially offset by 19 million in expenses related to Bakkt in 2021 prior to deconsolidation. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expenses 
 Depreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, aircraft, hardware and networking equipment, software, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. This expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives and technology. This expense also includes amortization of internally-developed and purchased software over its estimated useful life. 
 We recorded amortization expenses on intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on other intangible assets, of 610 million and 622 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 We recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of 421 million and 387 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in 2022 over 2021 was primarily due to an increase in internally developed software assets at ICE Mortgage Technology.

Consolidated Non-Operating Income/(Expense) 
 Income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. The following tables present our non-operating income/(expenses) (dollars in millions): 
 Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change 2021 2020 Change Other income/(expense): Interest income 
 108 1 n/a 1 10 (93) Interest expense

 (52) (11) 383 (11) (19) (44) 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income increased in 2022 from 2021 primarily due to an increase in short-term interest rates combined with larger investment balances. Interest income in 2022 includes 76 million in interest income recognized in connection with the short-term investments related to the 5.0 billion of SMR Notes (as defined in "Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt") for the Black Knight acquisition and the remainder primarily relates to interest on the restricted cash balances held within our regulated entities.

 Interest expense increased in 2022 from 2021 primarily due to 135 million in interest expense in 2022 related to the Black Knight acquisition-related-debt, 30 million in costs associated with our May 2022 debt refinancing as well as higher bond coupons associated with the re-financing of our existing debt. See Debt below. 
 Other income/(expense), net 
 Our equity method investments include OCC and Bakkt, among others. We recognized 1.3 billion) and 42 million) during 2022 and 2021, respectively, of our share of estimated equity method investment losses, net, and impairment charges, which are included in other income/(expense). In 2022, after recording our share of Bakkt's equity method losses, which included Bakkt's impairment charge, we recorded an impairment charge on our investment in Bakkt to its fair value as other expense. This was based on what we consider to be an other-than-temporary decline in fair value as a result of several factors, including consideration of the impairment charge recorded by Bakkt (see Notes 3 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements). The estimated losses and impairment during 2022 and 2021 are primarily related to our investment in Bakkt. These are partially offset by the estimated profits related to our investment in OCC. Both 2022 and 2021 include adjustments to reflect the difference between reported prior period actual results from our original estimates. 
 During 2021, Bakkt completed its merger with VIH, as a result of which we retained an approximate 68 economic interest in Bakkt, and we recorded a gain of 1.4 billion as other income upon our deconsolidation of Bakkt. Following the merger, we show our economic interest share of estimated Bakkt profits/(losses) as equity earnings, which are also included in other income (expense), net. We recorded other expense of 92 million) related to our Bakkt investment for the post-merger period during 2021. 
 During 2021, Coinbase completed an IPO and we sold our investment in Coinbase for 1.2 billion, and recorded a gain of 1.2 billion as other income. 
 During 2022, we recorded a 9 million accrual for legal settlements as other expense. During 2021, we recorded a gain of 7 million related to the settlement of an acquisition-related indemnification claim from a prior acquisition as other income. In addition, we accrued approximately 16 million related to a legal settlement. 
 We completed the sale of our Euroclear stake on May 20, 2022. The carrying value of our investment was 700 million at the time of the sale. We recorded a net gain of 41 million on the sale, which is included in other income during 2022. We did not receive a Euroclear dividend during the 2022 prior to the sale of our investment. 
 65 

We incurred foreign currency transaction losses of 9 million and 13 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. This was primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other income/(expense), net, when the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables occur in non-functional currencies and there is an increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods. See Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk -Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information on these items. 
 In connection with Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2017-07, Compensation Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost , or ASU 2017-07, we are recognizing the other components of net benefit cost of our defined benefit plans in the income statement as non-operating income on a full retrospective basis. The combined net periodic expense of these plans was 2 million and 3 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Non-controlling Interest 
 For consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100 , and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders interests are shown as non-controlling interests. As of December 31, 2022, our non-controlling interests include those related to the non-ICE limited partners' interest in our CDS clearing subsidiaries and non-controlling interest in ICE Futures Abu Dhabi. During 2021 we received a contribution from a group of minority investors for a non-controlling interest in ICE Futures Abu Dhabi. Prior to completion of the Bakkt transaction on October 15, 2021, our non-controlling interest also included the redeemable non-controlling interest of the non-ICE partners in Bakkt. On October 15, 2021, Bakkt completed its merger with VIH and as of December 31, 2021, we no longer held redeemable non-controlling interest related to Bakkt. Refer to Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report. 
 
 Consolidated Income Tax Provision 
 Consolidated income tax expense was 310 million and 1.6 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The change in consolidated income tax expense between years is primarily due to the tax impact of changes in our pre-tax income and the changes in our effective tax rate. The consolidated income tax expense for 2021 was elevated due to the tax expense associated with the gains resulting from our Coinbase and Bakkt transactions. 
 Our effective tax rate was 17 and 29 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2022 is lower than the effective tax rate for 2021 primarily due to the deferred income tax benefit from the impairment to our equity method investment in Bakkt in 2022 and deferred income tax expenses from the U.K. tax law changes in 2021. In 2021, the U.K. enacted a corporate income tax rate increase from 19 to 25 effective April 1, 2023. 
 See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report, for additional information on these tax items.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Below are charts that reflect our outstanding debt and capital allocation. The acquisition and integration costs in the chart below include cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash received for divestitures, cash paid for equity and equity method investments, cash paid for non-controlling interest and redeemable non-controlling interest, and acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, in each year. 

We have financed our operations, growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities. Our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures, working capital, strategic acquisitions and investments, stock repurchases, dividends and the development of our technology platforms. We believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt, but we 
 67 

may also need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities in the future. See - Future Capital Requirements below. 
 See - Cash Flow below for a discussion of our capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. 
 Consolidated cash and cash equivalents were 1.8 billion and 607 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We had 6.6 billion and 1.4 billion in short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the increase of which is related to the restricted 5.0 billion of SMR Notes intended to be used to finance the Black Knight acquisition. We had 142.0 billion and 145.9 billion of cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the amount of unrestricted cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries was 502 million. Due to U.S. tax reform, the majority of our foreign earnings since January 1, 2018 have been subject to immediate U.S. income taxation, and the existing non-U.S. unrestricted cash balance can be distributed to the U.S. in the future with no material additional income tax consequences. 
 Our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non-speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. We may invest a portion of our cash in excess of short-term operating needs in investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government-sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities. As of December 31, 2022, we held 1 million of unrestricted cash that was set aside for legal, regulatory and surveillance operations at NYSE. 
 Cash Flow 
 The following table presents the major components of net changes in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents (in millions): 
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Net cash provided by (used in): 
 Operating activities 
 3,554 3,123 2,881 Investing activities 
 677 (786) (10,361) Financing activities 
 (1,841) 62,026 26,000 Effect of exchange rate changes 
 (23) (6) 8 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, and cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds 2,367 64,357 18,528 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain items, including depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, stock-based compensation and the effects of changes in working capital. The 431 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2022 from 2021 was driven by a 220 million increase in net income, adjusted for certain noncash operating activities. In 2022, these adjustments also include the gain on the sale of our Euroclear investment and the net losses and impairment of our unconsolidated investees. During 2021, these adjustments also included the gains on the sale of our Coinbase investment and our deconsolidation of Bakkt. Net income increased in 2022 from 2021 due to higher revenues of 146 million, driven by our Exchanges and Fixed Income and Data Services segments, as well as lower expenses, primarily due to the deconsolidation of Bakkt. 
 The remaining 211 million increase is due to changes in our working capital and the timing of various payments and receipts. These changes include higher Section 31 fees payable of 316 million due to the rate changes determined by the SEC, offset primarily by timing of various payments and receipts, including higher interest receivable/payable on the cash and collateral held at our clearinghouses. 
 Investing Activities 
 Consolidated net cash provided by investing activities in 2022 primarily relates to 7.5 billion of proceeds from the sale of invested margin deposits and 741 million in proceeds from the sale of our Euroclear investment, partially offset by 6.9 billion purchases of invested margin deposits, 225 million of capitalized expenditures, 257 million of software development costs, 73 million for purchases of equity and equity method investments and 59 million cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired. 
 68 

Consolidated net cash used in investing activities in 2021 relates to 5.1 billion purchases of invested margin deposits, 179 million of capitalized expenditures, 273 million of capitalized software development costs, 117 million for the purchase of an equity method investment and 66 million cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, partially offset by 3.7 billion of proceeds from the sale of invested margin deposits and 1.2 billion in proceeds from the sale of our Coinbase investment. 
 The capital expenditures primarily relate to hardware and software purchases to continue the development and expansion of our electronic platforms, data services and clearing houses and leasehold improvements. The software development expenditures primarily relate to the development and expansion of our electronic trading platforms, data services, mortgage services and clearing houses. 
 Financing Activities 
 Consolidated net cash used in financing activities in 2022 primarily relates to a 4.5 billion change in our cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty fund balances, 2.7 billion in repayments of debt, 1.0 billion in net repayments under our Commercial Paper Program, 632 million in repurchases of common stock, 853 million in dividend payments to our stockholders and 73 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises, partially offset by 7.9 billion in net proceeds from our debt offerings. 
 Consolidated net cash provided by financing activities in 2021 primarily relates to an increase in our cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty fund balances of 65.7 billion, partially offset by 1.2 billion in repayments of debt, 1.4 billion in net repayments under our Commercial Paper Program, 250 million in repurchases of common stock, 747 million in dividend payments to stockholders and 70 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises. 
 Debt 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 18.1 billion in outstanding debt, all of which relates to our senior notes. We also have 4 million outstanding under credit lines at our ICE India subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022, our senior notes of 18.1 billion had a weighted average maturity of 16 years and a weighted average cost of 3.6 per annum. We did not have any commercial paper notes outstanding as of December 31, 2022. 
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 13.9 billion in outstanding debt, consisting of 12.9 billion of senior notes, 1.0 billion under our U.S. dollar commercial paper program, or the Commercial Paper Program, and 10 million under credit lines at our ICE India subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2021, our senior notes of 12.9 billion had a weighted average maturity of 15 years and a weighted average cost of 2.9 per annum. The commercial paper notes had original maturities ranging from three to 73 days as of December 31, 2021, with a weighted average interest rate of 0.33 per annum, and a weighted average remaining maturity of 26 days. 
 In September 2021, we used the proceeds from commercial paper issuances and cash on hand to fund the redemption of 1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior floating rate notes due in June 2023, or the Floating Rate Notes. We delivered a notice of redemption of the Floating Rate Notes to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, under the indenture governing the Floating Rate Notes, which was delivered to the holders of the Floating Rate Notes on September 17, 2021, and they were subsequently redeemed on September 27, 2021. In connection with this redemption, we recorded 4 million in accelerated unamortized deferred loan costs, which are included in interest expense in our consolidated statements of income for 2021. 
 We have a 3.9 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the Credit Facility, pursuant to a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as primary administrative agent, issuing lender and swing-line lender, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, backup administrative agent and swing-line lender, and the lenders party thereto. On October 15, 2021, we agreed with the lenders to extend the maturity date of the Credit Facility to October 15, 2026, among other items. On May 25, 2022, we agreed with the lenders to extend the maturity date of the Credit Facility from October 15, 2026, to May 25, 2027, among other items. As of December 31, 2022, of the 3.9 billion that is currently available for borrowing under the Credit Facility, 171 million was required to support certain broker-dealer and other subsidiary commitments. We did not have any notes outstanding under our Commercial Paper Program, as of December 31, 2022. Therefore, there was not a required amount to backstop the Commercial Paper Program. Amounts required to backstop notes outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. The remaining 3.7 billion is available for working capital and general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, acting as a backstop to future increases in the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program. 
 On May 23, 2022, we issued 8.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of new senior notes, comprised of the following: 
 1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 3.65 senior notes due in 2025, or the 2025 Notes; 
 69 

1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.00 senior notes due in 2027, or the 2027 Notes; 
 1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.35 senior notes due in 2029, or the 2029 Notes; 
 1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.60 senior notes due in 2033, or the 2033 Notes; 
 1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.95 senior notes due in 2052, or the 2052 Notes; and 
 1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 5.20 senior notes due in 2062, or the 2062 Notes, collectively, the Notes. 
 We intend to use the net proceeds of 4.9 billion from the offering of the 2025 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 2029 Notes and the 2062 Notes, or collectively, the SMR Notes, together with the issuance of commercial paper and/or borrowings under the Credit Facility, cash on hand or other immediately available funds and borrowings under the Term Loan, discussed below, to finance the cash portion of the purchase price for Black Knight. The SMR Notes are subject to a special mandatory redemption feature pursuant to which we will be required to redeem all of the outstanding SMR Notes at a redemption price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the SMR Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, in the event that the Black Knight acquisition is not consummated on or prior to May 4, 2023 subject to two automatic extensions of three months each, to August 4, 2023 and to November 4, 2023, respectively, if clearance under the HSR Act (or a restraint under U.S. antitrust laws) remains outstanding and all other conditions to closing are satisfied (or in the case of conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, are capable of being satisfied if the closing were to occur on such date) at each extension date, or if the Black Knight merger agreement is terminated at any time prior to such date. ICE would then need to secure new financing to close the transaction. There can be no assurance that the new financing could be secured and if it is secured, the terms of the new financing may be more expensive to ICE when compared to the existing financing terms for the 5.0 billion of outstanding notes. The 4.9 billion of net proceeds from the SMR Notes are separately invested and recorded as short-term restricted cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. 
 We used the 3.0 billion of net proceeds from the offering of the 2033 Notes and the 2052 Notes to redeem 2.7 billion aggregate principal amount of four series of senior notes that would have matured in 2022 and 2023. The balance of the net proceeds was used for general corporate purposes, which included paying down a portion of the amounts outstanding under our Commercial Paper Program. We recorded 30 million in costs associated with the extinguishment and re-financing of our existing debt in connection with our May 2022 debt refinancing. These costs are included in interest expense in our consolidated statements of income for 2022. For additional information regarding this transaction, refer to Note 3 to our consolidated unaudited financial statements, included in this Annual Report. 
 On May 4, 2022, we entered into a 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 14.0 billion, or the Bridge Facility. The commitments that the Company obtained for the Bridge Facility were permanently reduced from 14.0 billion and there were no amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2022 as a result of (i) the amendment and extension of the Credit Facility, (ii) the issuance by the Company of certain senior unsecured notes on May 23, 2022, (iii) Euroclear divestment proceeds, (iv) the generation of cash internally by the Company, and (v) the effectiveness of our term loan facility. 
 On May 25, 2022, we entered into a 2.4 billion two-year senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility, or the Term Loan. Draws under the Term Loan bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at either (a) Term SOFR plus an applicable margin plus a credit spread adjustment of 10 basis points or (b) a "base rate" plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges from 0.625 to 1.125 for Term SOFR loans and from 0.000 to 0.125 for base rate loans, in each case, based on a ratings-based pricing grid. The proceeds from borrowings under the Term Loan will be used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Black Knight acquisition. We have the option to prepay outstanding amounts under the Term Loan in whole or in part at any time. No amounts were outstanding under the Term Loan as of December 31, 2022. 
 Our Commercial Paper Program enables us to borrow efficiently at reasonable short-term interest rates and provides us with the flexibility to de-lever using our strong annual cash flows from operating activities whenever our leverage becomes elevated as a result of investment or acquisition activities. We had net repayments of 1.0 billion under our Commercial Paper Program during 2022, and did not have any notes outstanding under our Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2022. 
 Upon maturity of our commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand, we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper. To mitigate this risk, we maintain the Credit Facility for an aggregate amount which meets or exceeds the amount issued under our Commercial Paper Program at any time. If we were not able to issue new commercial paper, we have the option of drawing on the backstop revolving facility. However, electing to do so would result in higher interest expense.

For additional details of our debt instruments, refer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report. 
 Capital Return 
 In December 2021, our Board approved an aggregate of 3.15 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective January 1, 2022. The 3.15 billion replaced the previous amount approved by the Board. The approval of our Board for stock repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. In addition, our Board may increase or decrease the amount available for repurchases from time to time. 
 During 2022, we repurchased 5.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock at a cost of 632 million, including 4.6 million shares at a cost of 582 million under our Rule 10b5-1 trading plan and 0.4 million shares at a cost of 50 million on the open market. During 2021, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of our outstanding common stock at a cost of 250 million on the open market. Open market repurchases are only made during an open trading period and all shares repurchased are held in treasury stock. 
 We discontinued stock repurchases and terminated our Rule 10b5-1 trading plan in August 2020 in connection with our Ellie Mae acquisition and in November 2021, we resumed repurchases. In December 2021, we entered into a new Rule 10b5-1 trading plan that became effective in February 2022. In connection with our pending acquisition of Black Knight, on May 4, 2022, we terminated our Rule 10b5-1 trading plan and suspended share repurchases. The remaining balance of Board approved funds for future repurchases as of December 31, 2022 was 2.5 billion. 
 From time to time, we enter into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, as authorized by our Board, to govern some or all of the repurchases of our shares of common stock. We may discontinue stock repurchases at any time and may amend or terminate a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan at any time, subject to applicable rules. We expect funding for any stock repurchases to come from our operating cash flow or borrowings under our Commercial Paper Program or our debt facilities. The timing and extent of future repurchases that are not made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan will be at our discretion and will depend upon many conditions. In making a determination regarding any stock repurchases, management considers multiple factors, including overall stock market conditions, our common stock price performance, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our Board, the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our corporate debt ratings, our expected free cash flow and working capital needs, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives, and other potential uses of our cash and capital resources. 
 During 2022, we paid cash dividends of 1.52 per share of our common stock in the aggregate, including quarterly dividends of 0.38 per share, for an aggregate payout of 853 million, which includes the payment of dividend equivalents on unvested employee restricted stock units. Refer to Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, for details on the amounts of our quarterly dividend payouts for the last three years. 
 
 Future Capital Requirements 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of growth across our segments, strategic plans and acquisitions, available sources for financing activities, required and discretionary technology and clearing initiatives, regulatory requirements, the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, the geographic mix of our business and potential stock repurchases. 
 We currently expect to incur capital expenditures (including operational and real estate capital expenditures) and to incur software development costs that are eligible for capitalization ranging in the aggregate between 450 million and 500 million in 2023, which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology, business integration and the continued growth of our businesses. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 2.5 billion authorized for future repurchases of our common stock. Refer to Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional details on our stock repurchase program. 
 Our Board has adopted a quarterly dividend policy providing that dividends will be approved quarterly by the Board or the Audit Committee taking into account factors such as our evolving business model, prevailing business conditions, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives and our financial results and capital requirements, without a predetermined net income payout ratio. On February 2, 2023, we announced a 0.42 per share dividend for the first quarter of 2023 payable on March 31, 2023 to stockholders of record as of March 17, 2023. 
 Other than the facilities for the ICE Clearing Houses, our Credit Facility and our Commercial Paper Program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have for liquidity and capital resources with third parties. See 
 71 

Notes 10 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. In the event of any strategic acquisitions, mergers or investments, or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders, we may incur additional debt, issue additional equity to raise necessary funds, repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend. However, we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful, or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us. See -Risk Factors" and Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 We use certain financial measures internally to evaluate our performance and make financial and operational decisions that are presented in a manner that adjusts from their equivalent GAAP measures or that supplement the information provided by our GAAP measures. We use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. 
 We use these measures in communicating certain aspects of our results and performance, including in this Annual Report, and believe that these measures, when viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, can provide investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures alone. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for making period-to-period comparisons of results because the adjustments to GAAP are not reflective of our core business performance. 
 These financial measures are not presented in accordance with, or as an alternative to, GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We encourage investors to review the GAAP financial measures included in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements, to aid in their analysis and understanding of our performance and in making comparisons. 
 The table below outlines our adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to ICE common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are non-GAAP measures that are calculated by making adjustments for items we view as not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. These measures, including the adjustments and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments (in millions, except for percentages and per share amounts), are as follows:

 Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles are included in non-GAAP adjustments as excluding these non-cash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results. 
 Transaction and integration costs are included as part of our core business expenses, except for those that are directly related to the announcement, closing, financing or termination of a transaction. However, we adjust for the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relating to acquisitions such as Ellie Mae given the magnitude of the 11.4 billion purchase price of the acquisition. We also adjust for the acquisition-related transaction costs related to the merger of Bakkt and VIH, and for our pending acquisition of Black Knight, due to the significance of these transactions. 
 We adjust for gains and losses on investment transactions and changes in the fair value of our investments. Our investments are not considered to be a part of our core business operations and the impacts of changes in our investments are often non-cash in nature. 
 The following non-GAAP adjustments are reported in the table above related to investments: 
 During 2022, we excluded the 41 million gain on the sale of our Euroclear investment; 
 During 2021 and 2020, we excluded 34 million and 35 million, respectively, of fair value gains on our Euroclear equity investment and during 2021, we excluded Euroclear dividends received of 60 million; 
 In 2021, we excluded the 1.4 billion gain on the deconsolidation of Bakkt and the 1.2 billion gain on the sale of our Coinbase equity investment; and 
 In 2020, we excluded the 20 million gain on the sale of our BIDS equity investment. 
 73 

Similarly, and as included in the table above, we adjust for our share of net income/(losses) and impairment charges related to our equity method investments, which primarily include OCC and Bakkt. Our share of 2021 net losses from unconsolidated investees includes the period from the Bakkt merger on October 15, 2021 through December 31, 2021. During 2022, after recording our share of Bakkt's equity method losses, which included Bakkt's impairment charge, we recorded an impairment in our investment in Bakkt to its fair value as other expense. In 2022, the total Bakkt net losses and impairment was 1.4 billion and our share of OCC net income was 15 million. In 2021, our share of Bakkt losses was 92 million and our share of OCC income was 51 million. We believe these adjustments provide greater clarity of our performance given that equity method investments are non-cash and not a part of our core operations. 
 We adjust for certain items related to our debt. Certain debt activities, such as the early termination of notes, pre-acquisition interest and expense and accelerated amortization of debt costs are not considered to be a part of our core business operations and the impacts of changes in our investments are often non-cash in nature. The following non-GAAP adjustments are reported in the table above related to our debt: 
 In 2022, we adjusted for costs of 30 million associated with the May and June 2022 extinguishment of four series of senior notes that would have matured in 2022 and 2023 using proceeds from our May 2022 issuance of new senior notes. 
 In 2022, we excluded 135 million of interest expense on pre-acquisition-related debt from our May 2022 debt refinancing related to the pending Black Knight acquisition. This adjustment was net of 76 million of interest income earnings on investments from the pre-acquisition debt proceeds. 
 In 2021, we adjusted for the acceleration of unamortized costs of 4 million related to the September 2021 early redemption of our Floating Rate Notes. 
 In 2020, we adjusted for the extinguishment payment of 14 million related to the June 2020 early redemption of the December 2020 Senior Notes which included both a make-whole redemption payment and duplicative interest, and adjusted for pre-acquisition interest expense of 5 million on the August 2020 debt issued to fund a portion of the purchase price of our Ellie Mae acquisition. 
 Other adjustments not considered to be a part of our core business operations include: 
 Accruals related to legal and regulatory settlements, including settlements related to an acquisition-related indemnification claim; 
 A 2020 impairment of software developed at Bakkt when it was our subsidiary, since it related to the build-out of a fundamental software design rather than a recurring upgrade; and 
 A 2020 promissory note impairment charge on work performed by the original plan processor on the CAT as non-GAAP adjustments. See additional discussion on the CAT in Item 1(A) "-Risk Factors" in this Annual Report. 
 Non-GAAP tax adjustments include the tax impacts of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments and deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles. Deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles include the impact of U.K. and U.S. state tax law changes and apportionment updates, as well as other foreign tax law changes which resulted in deferred tax expense of 9 million, 183 million and 36 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to the following: 
 Deferred tax adjustments in 2022 related primarily to U.S. state apportionment changes. 
 Deferred tax adjustments in 2021 related primarily to the U.K. tax law changes enacted in June 2021, which increased the U.K. corporate income tax rate from 19 to 25 effective April 1, 2023. 
 The deferred tax adjustments in 2020 were due to the tax law changes enacted in July 2020, which increased the U.K. corporate income tax rate from 17 to 19 effective April 1, 2020, as well as impacts of U.S. state apportionment charges.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As described in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, certain clearing house collateral is reported off-balance sheet. We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities. 
 74 

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 
 We intend to fund our contractual obligations and commercial commitments from existing cash and cash flow from operations. As of December 31, 2022, our primary cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 18.1 billion in outstanding debt, including 4 million of short-term debt. Our outstanding debt consists of 18.1 billion of fixed rate senior notes and 4 million under credit lines at our ICE India subsidiaries. 
 Our operating leases primarily relate to our leased office space and data center facilities, and as of December 31, 2022, we had fixed lease payment obligations of 342 million, with 73 million payable within one-year. 
 We have other purchase obligations to purchase various goods and services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding. 
 In addition, we have 147.4 billion in cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds, invested deposits, delivery contracts payable and unsettled variation margin. Clearing members of our clearing houses are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund. The cash and cash equivalent deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them. ICE NGX administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts. It has an equal and offsetting claim to and from its respective participants on opposite sides of the physically-settled contract, each of which is reflected as a delivery contract receivable with an offsetting delivery contract payable. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits, guaranty funds, invested deposits, delivery contracts payable and unsettled variation margin. 
 We also have unrecognized tax benefits, or UTBs. As of December 31, 2022, our cumulative UTBs were 247 million, and accrued interest and penalties related to UTBs were 61 million. We are under examination by various tax authorities. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment. It is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our UTBs. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we, through NYSE, have net obligations of 102 million related to our pension and other benefit programs. The date of payment under these net obligations cannot be determined. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs. 
 In addition, the future funding of the implementation and operation of the CAT is ultimately expected to be provided by both the SROs and broker-dealers. To date, however, funding has been provided solely by the SROs, and future funding is expected to be repaid if industry member fees are approved by the SEC and subsequently collected by industry members. 
 
 New and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
 Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
 75 

We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments and re-evaluate them on a periodic basis. Based on these factors, we make estimates and judgments about, among other things, the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses. The values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future. 
 We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results, assets and liabilities. 
 Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets 
 Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions are recorded at their estimated fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired company over the fair value of its identifiable net assets, including identified intangible assets. We recognize specifically identifiable intangibles, such as customer relationships, trademarks, technology, trading products, data, exchange registrations, backlog, trade names and licenses when a specific right or contract is acquired. Our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets may be impaired following their acquisition requires us to apply significant judgments and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows. If we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments and estimates may change, which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives whereas goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not. 
 In performing the allocation of the acquisitions' purchase price to assets and liabilities, we consider, among other factors, the intended use of the acquired assets, analysis of past financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business. At the acquisition date, a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation performed with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist. We continue to review and assess our estimates, assumptions and valuation methodologies during the measurement period provided by GAAP, which ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable, which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition. Accordingly, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Estimation uncertainty may exist due to the sensitivity of the respective fair value to underlying assumptions about the future performance of an acquired business in our discounted cash flow models. Significant assumptions typically include revenue growth rates and expense synergies that form the basis of the forecasted results and the discount rate. 
 Our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, and we have identified four reporting units. Our reporting units identified for our goodwill testing are the NYSE, Other Exchanges, Fixed Income and Data Services, and Mortgage Technology reporting units. These impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles to its estimated fair value. 
 In accordance with ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment , or ASU-2017, for both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the fair value of the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in earnings in an amount equal to the difference. Alternatively, we may choose to bypass the qualitative option and perform quantitative testing to determine if the fair value is less than the carrying value. For our goodwill impairment testing, we have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and apply the quantitative approach. For our testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets, we apply qualitative and quantitative approaches. 
 Application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. We have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach. In assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, long-term growth rates of our business, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets. These estimates and assumptions require management s judgment, and changes to these estimates and assumptions, as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions, could materially affect the 
 76 

determination of fair value and/or impairment. We did not record any impairments in 2022, 2021 or 2020 as a result of our goodwill or indefinite-lived impairment testing. 
 We are also required to evaluate other finite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present, then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these long-lived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable. If an asset is not recoverable, the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset. Fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis, which are assessed and conducted in accordance with our internal impairment analysis policies. 
 Income Taxes 
 We are subject to income taxes in the U.S., U.K. and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. The determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities requires the use of significant judgment, estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. We recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse. 
 The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Staff has provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred. We have made a policy election to recognize such taxes as current period expenses when incurred. 
 We do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. If the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income. 
 We operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits. 
 We believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. 
 
 ITEM 7 (A). QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 As a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies. 
 77 

Interest Rate Risk 
 We have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and indebtedness. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents were 8.4 billion and 2.0 billion, respectively, of which 346 million and 276 million, respectively, were denominated in pounds sterling, euros or Canadian dollars, and the remaining amounts are denominated in U.S. dollars. We do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. A hypothetical 50 decrease in short-term interest rates would decrease our annual pre-tax earnings by 21 million as of December 31, 2022, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 18.1 billion in outstanding debt, consisting of 18.1 billion related to our senior notes and 4 million under lines of credit at our India subsidiaries. See Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Debt," and Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. 
 The interest rates on our Commercial Paper Program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any notes outstanding under our Commercial Paper Program. The weighted average interest rate on our Commercial Paper Program was 0.33 as of December 31, 2021. The effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances will continue to fluctuate based on the movement in short-term interest rates along with shifts in supply and demand within the commercial paper market. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 As an international business, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets and liabilities are recorded in pounds sterling, Canadian dollars or euros, and a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros. Certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries. Our exposure to foreign denominated earnings in 2022 and 2021 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (dollars in millions, except exchange rates): Year Ended December 31, 2022 Year Ended December 31, 2021 Pound Sterling Euro Pound Sterling Euro Average exchange rate to the U.S. dollar in the current year 1.2376 1.0540 1.3762 1.1835 Average exchange rate to the U.S. dollar in the prior year 1.3762 1.1835 1.2832 1.1412 Average exchange rate increase/(decrease) (10) (11) 7 4 Foreign denominated percentage of: Revenues, less transaction-based expenses

 (30) (8) 19 3 Operating income 
 (29) (48) 12 10 
 (1) Represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 We have a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros. In both 2022 and 2021, 13 of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, and in 2022 and 2021, 9 and 10 , respectively, of our consolidated operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros. As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. 
 Foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables occurs through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, or euros, due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. We incurred foreign currency transaction losses of 9 million and 13 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, inclusive of the impact of foreign currency hedging transactions. The foreign currency transaction losses were primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling 
 78 

and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. A 10 adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2022, assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity, would result in a foreign currency loss of 14 million. 
 We entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during 2022 and 2021 as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure. Although we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future, these hedging arrangements may not be effective, particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our non-U.S. denominated assets and liabilities. 
 We have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. Our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions): 
 As of December 31, 2022 Position in pounds sterling Position in Canadian dollars Position in euros Assets 720 4,298 171 of which goodwill represents 
 561 394 92 Liabilities 101 3,852 52 Net currency position 619 446 119 Net currency position, in USD 748 329 127 Negative impact on consolidated equity of a 10 decrease in foreign currency exchange rates 75 33 13 
 
 Foreign currency translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) within our balance sheet. See the table below for the portion of equity attributable to foreign currency translation adjustments as well as the activity by year included within our statement of other comprehensive income. The impact of the foreign currency exchange rate differences in the table below were primarily driven by fluctuations of the pound sterling as compared to the U.S. dollar which were 1.2093, 1.3524 and 1.3665 as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/ (Loss) from Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments (in millions) Balance, as of January 1, 2020

 (278) 
 
 The future impact on our business relating to the U.K. leaving the EU and the corresponding regulatory changes are uncertain at this time, including future impacts on currency exchange rates. 
 Credit Risk 
 We are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default. We limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments, monitoring them on an ongoing basis and executing agreements to protect our interests. 
 Clearing House Cash Deposit Risks 
 The ICE Clearing Houses hold material amounts of clearing member margin deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. Refer to Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the ICE Clearing Houses' cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and 
 79 

guaranty funds, invested deposits, delivery contracts receivable and unsettled variation margin which were 147.4 billion as of December 31, 2022. While we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. As the ICE Clearing Houses may pass on interest revenues (minus costs) to the clearing members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions. The following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated: 
 Credit Risk: When a clearing house has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank, the clearing house utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures. Credit risk is managed by using exposure limits depending on the credit profile of the counterparty as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. Our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. We seek to substantially mitigate the credit risk associated with investments by placing them with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties. 
 An ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties. In addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk. 
 Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk a clearing house may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and at the right time. To mitigate this risk, the clearing houses monitor liquidity requirements closely and maintain funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearing house to such funds and assets. For example, holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short term investments such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements serves to reduce liquidity risks. 
 Interest Rate Risk: Interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise and cause the value of securities we hold or invest in to decline. If we were required to sell securities prior to maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale might be made at a loss relative to the carrying value. Our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making short term investments. For example, where possible and in accordance with regulatory requirements, the clearing houses invest cash pursuant to overnight reverse repurchase agreements or term reverse repurchase agreements with short dated maturities. In addition, the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt (for example, U.S. Treasury securities) and supranational debt instruments (Euro cash deposits only) with short dated maturities. 
 Security Issuer Risk: Security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on the payment when the security matures or debt is serviced. This risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments under the reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign or government agency debt and limiting any direct investments to high quality sovereign debt instruments. 
 Investment Counterparty Risk: Investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses. We mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral to securities of high quality issuers. When engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the securities underlying the reverse repurchase arrangement in custody accounts under clearing house control. Additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. Thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the counterparty s obligation. 
 The ICE Clearing Houses may use third-party investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided by each clearing house. Clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control with credit worthy custodians. The ICE Clearing Houses employ (or may employ) multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role, additional advisors or custodians are available as alternatives. 
 Cross-Currency Margin Deposit Risk: Each of the ICE Clearing Houses may permit posting of cross-currency collateral to satisfy margin requirements (for example, accepting margin deposits denominated in U.S. dollars to secure a Euro margin obligation). The ICE Clearing Houses mitigate the risk of a currency value exposure by applying a haircut to the currency posted as margin at a level viewed as sufficient to provide financial protection during periods of currency volatility. Cross-currency balances are marked-to-market on a daily basis. Should the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value, the clearing member is required to increase its margin deposit on a same-day basis. 
 80 

Impact of Inflation 
 We have not been materially adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant. In the event of continued inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 Our management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The financial statements were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances and, accordingly, include certain amounts based on our best judgments and estimates. 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-a5(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act ). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by a program of internal audits and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel and a written Global Code of Business Conduct adopted by our Board of Directors, applicable to all of our directors and all officers and all of our employees. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment, management believes that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. 
 Our independent auditors, Ernst Young LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the Audit Committee, subject to ratification by our stockholders. Ernst Young LLP has audited and reported on our consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The reports of our independent registered public accounting firm are contained in this Annual Report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. and Subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and redeemable non-controlling interest, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes, and our report dated February 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and redeemable non-controlling interest, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework), and our report dated February 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Accounting for Income Taxes 
 
 Description of the Matter 0 As discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company operates in the United States and multiple international tax jurisdictions and is therefore subject to various tax treaty arrangements and where applicable, transfer pricing guidelines for intercompany transactions. Consolidated income tax expense, including the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, is an estimate based on management s understanding and interpretation of current enacted tax laws and tax rates of each tax jurisdiction. For the year-ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized consolidated income tax expense of 310 million, and as of December 31, 2022, the Company accrued liabilities of 247 million for unrecognized tax benefits. 
 85 

Auditing the Company's accounting for consolidated income tax expense was complex because management s calculation of consolidated income tax expense involves application and interpretation of complex tax laws. Further, the identification and measurement of unrecognized tax benefits requires significant management judgment and estimation. Each tax position may involve unique facts and circumstances to be evaluated, and there may be uncertainties around initial recognition and de-recognition of tax positions, including regulatory changes, litigation and examination activity. 
 How we Addressed the 
 Matter in Our Audit We tested the Company s controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the Company s consolidated income tax expense. For example, we tested controls over management s calculation of the federal, state and foreign components of income tax expense including management s controls over the identification and ongoing review of its unrecognized tax benefits. 
 
 To test consolidated income tax expense, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, recalculation of consolidated income tax expense and agreeing the data used in the calculations to the Company s underlying books and records. We involved our tax professionals to evaluate the application of tax law to management s calculation methodologies and tax positions. We also evaluated assumptions the Company used to develop its tax positions and related unrecognized tax benefit amounts by jurisdiction. For example, we compared the estimated liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits to similar positions in prior periods and assessed management s consideration of current tax controversy and litigation and trends in similar positions challenged by tax authorities. We also evaluated the adequacy of the Company s disclosures included in Note 13 in relation to these tax matters.

 of the reverse repurchase amount. Thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of securities with a value potentially greater than the reverse repurchase counterparty s obligation to the clearing house. 
 ICE Clear Credit, a systemically important financial market utility as designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, maintains a U.S. dollar account at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago as of December 31, 2022. ICE Clear Europe maintains a euro-denominated account at the European Central Bank, or ECB, the central bank of the Netherlands, as well as pounds sterling- and euro-denominated accounts at the Bank of England, or BOE, the central bank of the U.K. These accounts provide the flexibility for ICE Clear Europe to place euro- and pounds sterling-denominated cash margin securely at national banks, in particular during periods when liquidity in the euro and pounds sterling repo markets may temporarily become contracted. Such accounts are intended to decrease ICE Clear Credit and ICE Clear Europe s custodial, liquidity and operational risk as compared to alternative custodial and investment arrangements. 
 Our futures businesses have minimal credit risk as the majority of their transaction revenues are currently cleared through our clearing houses. Our accounts receivable related to fixed income and data services revenues, cash trading, listing revenues, technology revenues, CDS and bilateral over-the-counter, or OTC, energy transaction revenues and mortgage technology services subjects us to credit (collection) risk, as we do not require these customers to post collateral. We limit our risk of loss by terminating a customer's ability to remain listed or receive data or terminating other services for entities with delinquent accounts. The concentration of risk on accounts receivable is also mitigated by the large number of entities comprising our customer base. Excluding clearing members, there were no individual accounts receivable balances greater than 10 of total consolidated accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021. Our accounts receivable are stated at the billed amount.

We do not currently expect that any pending accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on our financial statements. 
 Adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 
 On January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13 using the modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment of million, net of tax, to retained earnings. ASU 2016-13 primarily impacted the calculation of our allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable utilizing the expected credit losses model. We do not currently hold available-for-sale debt securities, off-balance-sheet credit exposures, or other material financial assets impacted by the standard, besides those mentioned below. 
 
 We consider our material financial assets within scope, including our cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash equivalents as well as our clearing members' cash equivalent and reverse repurchase receivables, and determined that such assets have a de minimis risk of credit loss. We invest our cash and clearing members' cash by placing it in highly-rated government securities, primarily U.S. Treasury securities and other sovereign debt with original maturities of less than three months which we consider to be cash equivalents, or into reverse repurchase agreements, referred to as reverse repos, with primarily overnight maturities. Reverse repos are valued daily and are subject to collateral maintenance provisions whereby the counterparty must provide additional collateral if the value of the underlying securities lose value, in an amount sufficient to maintain collateralization of at least . Therefore, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 we have not recorded a credit loss for these financial assets. 
 
 Based on the high turnover and collectability of our accounts receivable, the mitigated default and concentration risks due to the high quality and large number of entities comprising our customer base, and the monthly billing process for the majority of our revenue, we have not experienced a significant increase in the loss provision recognized upon adoption of the CECL model.

 During 2022 and 2021, we acquired multiple companies which were not material to our operations. 
 Pending Acquisition of Black Knight, Inc. 
 On May 4, 2022, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Black Knight, Inc., or Black Knight, a software, data and analytics company that serves the housing finance continuum, including real estate data, mortgage lending and servicing, as well as the secondary markets. Pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 4, 2022, among ICE, Sand Merger Sub Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of ICE, or Sub, and Black Knight, which we refer to as the merger agreement, Sub will merge with and into Black Knight, which we refer to as the merger, with Black Knight surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of ICE. As of May 4, 2022, the transaction was valued at approximately billion, or per share of Black Knight common stock, with cash comprising of the value of the aggregate transaction consideration and shares of our common stock comprising of the value of the aggregate transaction consideration at that time. The aggregate cash component of the transaction consideration is fixed at billion, and the value of the aggregate stock component of the transaction consideration will fluctuate with the market price of our common stock and will be determined based on the average of the volume weighted averages of the trading prices of our common stock on each of the ten consecutive trading days ending three trading days prior to the 
 101 

billion from private equity firm Thoma Bravo. The purchase price consisted of billion in cash, as adjusted for million of cash and cash equivalents held by Ellie Mae on the date of acquisition, and approximately billion, or approximately million shares of our common stock, based on our stock price on the acquisition date. ICE funded the cash portion of the purchase price with net proceeds from our offering of new senior notes in August 2020, together with the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings under a new senior unsecured term loan facility (see Note 10). We have evaluated the impact of this acquisition and related disclosures under ASC 805- Business Combinations. 
 The purchase price has been allocated to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based on the respective estimated fair values on the date of acquisition, as determined with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist. The excess of purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets has been recorded as goodwill. Goodwill represents potential revenue synergies related to new product development, various expense synergies and opportunities to enter new markets.

 Bakkt Transaction 
 On October 15, 2021, Bakkt completed its merger with VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings, or VIH, a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by Victory Park Capital, or VPC. The business combination between Bakkt and VIH resulted in enterprise value of approximately billion, including approximately million of cash on the combined company s balance sheet, reflecting a contribution of up to million of cash held in VIH s trust account, and a million concurrent private investment in public equity, or PIPE, of Class A common stock of the combined company and million of cash held in Bakkt accounts. The PIPE was priced at per share and included a million commitment from us. The newly combined company has been renamed Bakkt Holdings, Inc. and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE. 
 As part of the transaction, Bakkt s existing equity holders and management rolled of their equity into the combined company through a retained variable interest in Bakkt and are subject to a six-month lockup period. Certain shareholders of VIH exercised their redemption rights, and at closing, Bakkt equity holders, including ICE, owned approximately of the combined company, VIH s public shareholders owned approximately , VPC owned , and PIPE investors (a group that also includes us) owned approximately of the issued and outstanding equity of the combined company. 
 Following completion of the business combination, we held an approximate economic interest, which includes both our variable interest and PIPE investment. As a result of limitations on ICE from the Bakkt voting agreement entered into in connection with the transaction, we hold a minority voting interest in the combined company. Prior to the closing, Bakkt revenues and operating expenses were reported within our consolidated revenues and operating expenses. Following the closing, as a consequence of our inability to meet the power criterion through our variable interest and because of holding a minority voting interest in the combined company, during the fourth quarter of 2021 we deconsolidated Bakkt upon loss of control and prospectively treat it as an equity method investment within our financial statements. We recorded a pre-tax gain on the transaction of billion during the fourth quarter of 2021, which is included in other non-operating income within our consolidated income statement. The pre-tax gain is a result of recording an equity method investment value of billion plus the removal of our redeemable non-controlling interest liability of million, partially offset by the deconsolidation of Bakkt net assets of million and our additional PIPE contribution of million. 
 The merger of Bakkt and VIH triggered a market condition event on the Bakkt equity incentive awards. As a result, during 2021, we incurred a million non-cash compensation expense related to these awards which we recorded as an acquisition-related cost prior to deconsolidating Bakkt (see Note 11). 
 
 Bridge2 Solutions Acquisition Considerations 
 Bridge2 Solutions is a leading provider of loyalty solutions for merchants and consumers. Subsequent to its acquisition by us in February 2020, Bridge2 Solutions was contributed to Bakkt in combination with its capital call. To fund the acquisition of Bridge2 Solutions, Bakkt completed a capital call for million in funding by ICE and the minority investors. This acquisition-related capital call triggered a market condition of certain Bakkt equity incentive awards, and as a result, we incurred a million non-cash compensation expense in 2020 related to these awards which was recorded as an acquisition-related cost (see Note 11).

 In December 2018, Bakkt was capitalized with million in initial funding with ICE as the majority owner, along with a group of other minority investors, and in March 2020, an additional million in funding occurred with ICE maintaining its majority ownership. We held a call option over these interests subject to certain terms. Similarly, the non-ICE partners in Bakkt held a put option to require us to repurchase their interests subject to certain terms. These minority interests were reflected as redeemable non-controlling interests in temporary equity within our consolidated balance sheet. Following the October 2021 Bakkt merger discussed above, we no longer consolidate Bakkt and therefore did not record a redeemable non-controlling interest in Bakkt as of December 31, 2022 or 2021.

 stake in Euroclear, plc, or Euroclear, that we originally purchased for million. We appointed a director to the Euroclear Board of Directors, and classified our investment in Euroclear as an equity investment. 
 On May 20, 2022, we completed the sale of our stake in Euroclear. The carrying value of our investment was million at the time of the sale and was classified within other current assets on our balance sheet. We recorded a net gain on the sale of million, which is included in other income in 2022. 
 We did t receive a dividend from Euroclear during 2022 or 2020. We recognized dividend income of million in 2021 from Euroclear, included in other income.

billion and recorded a gain of billion, or million net of tax, as other income in our consolidated statement of income. 
 Equity Method Investments 
 Our equity method investments include OCC and Bakkt, among others. Our equity method investments are included in other non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We carry our equity method investments at cost and assess the carrying value periodically if impairment indicators are present. At the end of each reporting period, we record our share of profits or losses of our equity method investments as equity earnings included in other income. In addition, if and when our equity method investments issue cash dividends to us, we deduct the amount of these dividends from the carrying amount of that investment. 
 We recognized billion), million) and million as our share of estimated profits/(losses) and impairment, net, from our equity method investments other income/(expense) during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The estimated losses during 2022 and 2021 are primarily related to our investment in Bakkt, and the estimated profits during 2020 are related to our investment in OCC. Each period includes adjustments to reflect the difference between reported prior period actual results from our original estimates. 
 When performing our assessment of the carrying value of our investments, we consider, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis, if applicable, the investee's financial condition and near-term prospects, the economic or technological environment in which our investees operate, weakening of the general market condition of the related industry, whether an investee can continue as a going concern, any impairment charges recorded by an investee on goodwill, intangible or long-lived assets, and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. 
 Investment in OCC 
 We own a interest in OCC through a direct investment by the NYSE. OCC is regulated by the SEC as a registered clearing agency and by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, as a derivatives clearing organization. OCC serves as a clearing house for securities options, security futures, commodity futures and options on futures traded on various independent exchanges. OCC clears securities options traded on NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex Options, along with other non-affiliated exchanges. 
 We recognized million, million and million during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, of equity earnings as our share of OCC's estimated profits, which is included in other income. 
 
 Investment in Bakkt 
 Following Bakkt's October 15, 2021 merger with VIH, we held an approximate economic interest and treat it as an equity method investment (see Note 3). We recorded estimated equity losses and impairment of billion during 2022 related to our investment in Bakkt. 
 During 2022, Bakkt reported an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. As of December 31, 2022, after recording our share of Bakkt's equity method losses, which included Bakkt's impairment charge, we recorded an impairment in our investment in Bakkt to its fair value as other expense. This was based on what we consider to be an other-than-temporary decline in fair value as a result of the factors noted above, including consideration for the impairment charge recorded by Bakkt. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investment in Bakkt was determined to be million. 
 We have concluded that Bakkt meets the significance test under Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X for 2022. Bakkt s total assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2022 were million and million, respectively, and Bakkt s net revenues and net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 were million and billion), respectively. Bakkt s total assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2021 were billion and million, respectively, and Bakkt s net revenues and net loss for the period from October 15, 2021 through December 31, 2021 were million and million), respectively. In accordance with Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X, financial statements for Bakkt as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 will be filed subsequently as an amendment to this Form 10-K.

performance obligations: (1) trade execution/clearing novation and (2) risk management of open interest. While we allocate the transaction price between these performance obligations, since they generally are satisfied almost simultaneously, there is no significant deferral of revenue. Our Exchanges segment futures and options transaction and clearing revenues are reported net of rebates. Rebates were million, million and million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Transaction and clearing fees can be variable based on trade volume discounts used in the determination of rebates, however virtually all volume discounts are calculated and recorded on a monthly basis. Transaction and clearing fees, as well as any volume discounts rebated to our customers, are calculated and billed monthly in accordance with our published fee schedules. 
 Cash Equities and Equity Options: Revenues in our cash equity and equity options markets represent trade execution fees. Cash trading and equity options contain performance obligation related to each transaction which occurs instantaneously, and the revenue is recorded at the point in time of the transaction. We make liquidity payments to certain customers, as well as charge routing fees related to orders in our markets which are routed to other markets for execution and recognize those payments as a cost of revenue. In addition, we pay NYSE regulatory oversight fees to the SEC and collect equal amounts from our customers. These are also considered a cost of revenue, and both of these NYSE-related fees are included in transaction-based expenses. For one of our equity option exchanges, revenues are reported net of rebates. Rebates for that exchange were million, million and million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
 Listings: Our listings revenues include original and annual listings fees, and other corporate action fees. Each distinct listing fee is allocated to multiple performance obligations including original and incremental listing and investor relations services, as well as a customer s material right to renew the option to list on our exchanges. In performing this allocation, the standalone selling price of the listing services is based on the original and annual listing fees and the standalone selling price of the investor relations services is based on its market value. All listings fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time. Revenue related to the investor relations performance obligation is recognized ratably over the period these services are provided, with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges. Listings fees related to other corporate actions are considered contract modifications of our listing contracts and are recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges. 
 Data and Connectivity Services: Our data and connectivity services revenues are related to the various data and connectivity services that we provide which are directly attributable to our exchange venues. Exchange data services include, among other offerings, proprietary real-time and historical pricing data, as well as order book and transaction information related to our global futures markets and the NYSE exchanges. In addition, we receive a share of revenue from the National Market System, or NMS, Plan. Separately, we also provide connectivity services directly related to our futures, cash equity and options exchanges and clearing houses. Data and connectivity services revenues are primarily subscription-based, billed monthly, quarterly or annually in advance and recognized ratably over time as our performance obligations of data delivery are met consistently throughout the period. Considering that these contracts primarily consist of single performance obligations with fixed prices, there is no variable consideration and no need to allocate the transaction price. 
 OTC and Other: Our OTC revenues are generated in our bilateral energy markets where we offer electronic trading on contracts based on physically settled natural gas, power and refined oil contracts. Other revenues primarily include interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. Generally, fees for OTC and other revenues contain one performance obligation. Because these contracts primarily consist of single performance obligations with fixed prices, there is no variable consideration and no need to allocate the transaction price. Services for OTC and other revenues are primarily satisfied at a point in time. Therefore, there is no need to allocate the fee and no deferral results as we have no further obligation to the customer at that time.

performance obligation related to each transaction which occurs instantaneously, and the revenue is recorded at the point in time. Fixed income revenues also include interest income on certain clearing margin deposits related to our CDS clearing business which are satisfied at a point in time and consists of a single performance obligations. 
 CDS Clearing: CDS clearing revenues are reported net of rebates. Rebates were nominal in 2022, 2021 and 2020. We provide clearing services to the global CDS market and the timing and nature of our CDS transaction and clearing revenue is similar in nature to the Exchanges Segment transaction and clearing revenues discussed above. The CDS derivatives trading and clearing fees contain performance obligations: (1) trade execution/clearing novation and (2) risk management of open interest. While we allocate the transaction price between these performance obligations, since they generally are satisfied almost simultaneously, there is no significant deferral of revenue. 
 Fixed Income Data and Analytics, and Other Data and Network Services: Fixed income data and analytics services revenues are recurring in nature and include evaluated pricing and reference data and analytics including sovereign, corporate and municipal bonds, mortgage and asset-backed securities, as well as leveraged loans. Other data and network services include those related to the ICE Global Network and our consolidated feeds business, as well as desktops and other multi-asset class analytics. 
 The nature and timing of each contract type for the data services above are similar in nature. Data services revenues are primarily subscription-based, billed monthly, quarterly or annually in advance and recognized ratably over time as our performance obligations of data delivery are met consistently throughout the period. Considering that these contracts primarily consist of single performance obligations with fixed prices, there is no variable consideration and no need to allocate the transaction price. In certain of our data contracts, where third parties are involved, we either arrange for the third party to transfer the services to our customers, or we transfer third-party data to our customers; in these arrangements we are acting as an agent and revenue is recorded net. 
 
 Mortgage Technology Revenues 
 Origination Technology: Our origination technology acts as a system of record for the mortgage transaction, automating the gathering, reviewing, and verifying of mortgage-related information and enabling automated enforcement of rules and business practices designed to help ensure that each completed loan transaction is of high quality and adheres to secondary market standards. These revenues are based on recurring Software as a Service, or SaaS, subscription fees, with an additive transaction-based success-based pricing fee as lenders exceed the number of loans closed that are included with their monthly base subscription. 
 In addition, the ICE Mortgage Technology network provides originators connectivity to the mortgage supply chain and facilitates the secure exchange of information between our customers and a broad ecosystem of third-party service providers, as well as lenders and investors that are critical to consummating the millions of loan transactions that occur on our origination network each year. Revenue from the ICE Mortgage Technology network is largely transaction-based. 
 Performance obligations consist of a series of distinct services and support services. Mortgage subscription customers simultaneously receive and consume benefits from our performance and revenues are recognized over time as our performance obligations are met consistently throughout the period. Contracts generally range from . Success-based contracts are subject to monthly billing calculations whereby customers are obligated to pay the greater of a contractual base fee or variable closed loan fee based on the number of closed loan transactions processed by the customer in the specific month. Under success-based contracts, monthly base fees are recognized ratably over the contract terms as subscription performance obligations are satisfied and closed loan fees in excess of base fees are considered variable consideration.

On October 15, 2021, we agreed with the lenders to extend the date of the Credit Facility from August 21, 2025 to October 15, 2026, among other items. On May 25, 2022, we agreed with the lenders to extend the maturity date of the Credit Facility from October 15, 2026, to May 25, 2027, among other items. We also exercised our option to increase the amount of the Credit Facility from billion to billion.

We did not have any notes outstanding under our U.S. dollar commercial paper program, or the Commercial Paper Program, as of December 31, 2022. Therefore, there was not a required amount to backstop the Commercial Paper Program. Amounts required to back-stop notes outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. The remaining billion is available for working capital and general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, acting as a back-stop to future increases in the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program.

 2022 Term Loan: On May 25, 2022, we entered into a billion senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility, or Term Loan. Draws under the Term Loan bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at either (a) Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or Term SOFR, plus an applicable margin plus a credit spread adjustment of basis points or (b) a "base rate" plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges from to for Term SOFR loans and from to for base rate loans, in each case, based on a ratings-based pricing grid. The proceeds from borrowings under the Term Loan will be used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Black Knight acquisition. We incurred new debt issuance costs of million relating to the Term Loan and these costs are represented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as other non-current assets and will be amortized over the remaining life of the Term Loan. We have the option to prepay outstanding amounts under the Term Loan in whole or in part at any time. No amounts were outstanding under the Term Loan as of December 31, 2022.

 Other: Our India subsidiaries maintain million of credit lines for their general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2022, they had borrowed million, which is reflected as "other short-term debt" in the table above. 
 Commercial Paper Program 
 Our Commercial Paper Program is currently backed by the borrowing capacity available under the Credit Facility, as described above. The effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short-term interest rates, which fluctuate due to market conditions and as a result may impact our interest expense. 
 We had net repayments of billion under the Commercial Paper Program during 2022 funded, in part, by the May 2023 net proceeds from our Senior Notes offering, discussed below. We had net repayments of billion under the Commercial Paper Program during 2021. We used billion of proceeds received from the sale of our Coinbase investment to pay down the commercial paper balance. We had net issuances of billion under the Commercial Paper Program during 2020 the proceeds of which were primarily used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Ellie Mae acquisition.

 We intend to use the net proceeds of billion from the offering of the 2025 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 2029 Notes and the 2062 Notes, or collectively, the SMR Notes, together with the issuance of commercial paper and/or borrowings under the Credit Facility, cash on hand or other immediately available funds and borrowings under the Term Loan, discussed below, to finance the cash portion of the purchase price for Black Knight. The SMR Notes are subject to a special mandatory redemption feature pursuant to which we will be required to redeem all of the outstanding SMR Notes at a redemption price equal to of the aggregate principal amount of the SMR Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, in the event that the Black Knight acquisition is not consummated on or prior to May 4, 2023, subject to automatic extensions of each, to August 4, 2023 and to November 4, 2023, respectively, if U.S. antitrust clearance or a related law, injunction, order or other judgment, in each case whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the Black Knight merger remains outstanding and all other conditions to closing are satisfied (or in the case of conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, are capable of being satisfied if the closing were to occur on such date) at each extension date, or if the Black Knight merger agreement is terminated at any time prior to such date. The billion of net proceeds from the SMR Notes are separately invested and recorded as short-term restricted cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. 
 We used the billion of net proceeds from the offering of the 2033 Notes and the 2052 Notes to redeem billion aggregate principal amount of four series of senior notes that would have matured in 2022 and 2023. The balance of the net proceeds was used for general corporate purposes, which included paying down a portion of the amounts outstanding under our Commercial Paper Program. We recorded million in costs associated with the extinguishment and re-financing of our existing debt in connection with our May 2022 debt refinancing which includes a make-whole redemption of million, duplicative interest of million and million of accelerated unamortized deferred debt costs. These costs are included in interest expense in our consolidated statements of income for 2022. 
 We incurred debt issuance costs of million relating to the issuance of the Notes and these costs are presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability and will be amortized over the remaining term of each series of the Notes. The Notes contain affirmative and negative covenants, including, but not limited to, certain redemption rights, limitations on liens and indebtedness and limitations on certain mergers, sales, dispositions and lease-back transactions.

As of December 31, 2022, we had million shares in total under various equity plans available for future issuance as stock option and restricted stock awards. 
 Stock Option Plans 
 Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of our common stock on the grant date. We may grant, under provisions of the plans, both incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options. The options generally vest over three or and may generally be exercised up to after the date of grant, but generally expire either or days after termination of employment. The shares of common stock issued under our stock option plans are made available from authorized and unissued common stock or treasury shares. 
 The fair value is based on our closing stock price on the date of grant as well as certain other assumptions. Compensation expense arising from option grants is recognized ratably over the vesting period based on the grant date fair value, net of estimated forfeitures.

 As of December 31, 2022, there were million in total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options, which are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years as the stock options vest. 
 We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards. 
 Expected life in years

 Estimated weighted-average fair value of options granted per share 
 
 The risk-free interest rate is based on the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the date of grant. The expected life is derived from historical and anticipated future exercise patterns. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility data of our stock. 
 Restricted Stock Plans 
 Restricted shares are used as an incentive to attract and retain qualified employees and to align our and our stockholders' interests by linking actual performance to both short and long-term stockholder return. We issue awards that may contain a combination of time, performance and/or market conditions. The grant date fair value of each award is based on the closing stock price of our stock at the date of grant. 
 Granted but unvested shares are generally forfeited upon termination of employment, whereby compensation costs previously recognized for unvested shares are reversed. Until the shares vest and are issued, participants have no voting or dividend rights and the shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered. Unvested restricted stock earns dividend equivalents which are paid in cash on the vesting date. 
 The grant date fair value of time-based restricted stock units is recognized as expense ratably over the vesting period, which is typically three or , net of forfeitures. Our equity plans include a change in control provision that may accelerate vesting on both the time-based and performance-based restricted shares if the awards are not assumed by an acquirer in the case of a change in control. 
 For awards with performance conditions, we recognize compensation costs, net of forfeitures, using an accelerated attribution method over the vesting period. Compensation costs are recognized only if it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied. If we initially determine that it is not probable of being satisfied and later determine that it is, or vice versa, a cumulative catch-up adjustment is retroactively recorded in the period of change based on the new estimate. We recognize the remaining compensation costs over the remaining vesting period.

million restricted shares for potential issuance as performance-based restricted shares to certain of our employees. The number of shares ultimately granted under this award is based on our actual financial performance as compared to financial performance targets set by our Board and the Compensation Committee for the year ending December 31, 2022, and is also subject to a market condition reduction based on how our 2022 total stockholder return, or TSR, compared to that of the S P 500 Index. In 2022, we performed at a performance level "below-target". Based on our actual 2022 financial performance as compared to the 2022 financial performance level thresholds, and without a required TSR haircut since we were "below-target", million restricted shares will be awarded. This results in million in compensation expenses that will be expensed over the accelerated vesting period, including million expensed during 2022.

 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
 We offer our employees participation in our ESPP, under which we have reserved and may sell up to million shares of our common stock to employees. The ESPP grants participating employees the right to acquire our stock in increments of of eligible pay, with a maximum contribution of of eligible pay, subject to applicable annual Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, limitations. Under our ESPP, participating employees are limited to of common stock annually, and a maximum of shares of common stock each offering period. There are offering periods each year, from January 1 st (or the first trading day thereafter) through June 30 th (or the last trading day prior to such date) and from July 1 st (or the first trading day thereafter) through December 31 st (or the last trading day prior to such date). The purchase

 Bakkt Incentive Units 
 Prior to the Bakkt merger with VIH (see Note 3), we sponsored the Bakkt Equity Incentive Plan under which Bakkt issued various Bakkt preferred, common and phantom, or participation, equity unit awards. These awards were made to certain employees and board members of Bakkt. The units were unvested at the issuance date, were subject to the vesting terms in the award agreements and upon vesting were converted into Bakkt equity or cash. 
 During 2020, a million capital call related to the acquisition of Bridge2 Solutions triggered a market condition of certain of these Bakkt equity incentive awards. The market condition was based on numerous possible Bakkt transaction or event scenarios established on the original date of grant, each of which have a fixed fair market value. Over the life of these awards, we were required to estimate the most likely outcome and reflect the cumulative financial statement impact of any changes between outcomes. As a result, during 2020, we incurred a million non-cash compensation expense related to these awards that was recorded as an acquisition-related cost. 
 During 2021, the merger of Bakkt and VIH triggered a market condition of these Bakkt equity incentive awards. As a result, during 2021, we incurred million of non-cash compensation expense related to these awards which we recorded as an acquisition-related cost prior to deconsolidating Bakkt.

 billion shares with a par value of per share. Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held of record by such holder on all matters on which stockholders are entitled to vote, including the election and removal of directors. There were million and million shares of common stock issued and outstanding, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. There were million and million shares of common stock issued and outstanding, respectively, as of December 31, 2021. 
 Preferred Stock 
 We are authorized to issue million shares of preferred stock with a par value of per share. The holders of a series of preferred stock shall be entitled only to such voting rights as shall expressly be granted thereto by the Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation relating to such series of preferred stock). As of December 31, 2022, no shares of preferred stock have been issued. 
 Treasury Stock 
 During each of 2022, 2021 and 2020, we received million shares of common stock from employees to satisfy tax withholdings we made on their behalf for restricted stock and stock option exercises. We recorded the receipt of the shares as treasury stock. 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 We periodically review whether to repurchase our stock. In making a determination regarding the timing and extent of any stock repurchases, we consider multiple factors that may include: overall stock market conditions, our common stock price performance, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our Board, the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our debt ratings, our expected free cash flow and working capital needs, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives, and other potential uses of our cash and capital resources. 
 Repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market, through established trading plans, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. We may begin or discontinue stock repurchases at any time and may amend or terminate a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan at any time or enter into additional plans. 
 We discontinued stock repurchases and terminated our Rule 10b5-1 trading plan in August 2020 in connection with the Ellie Mae acquisition. In November 2021, we resumed stock repurchases. In December 2021, our Board approved an aggregate of billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective January 1, 2022. The billion replaces the previous amount approved by the Board. In December 2021 we entered 
 122 

million shares, million shares and million shares, respectively, of our outstanding common stock at a cost of million, million and billion, respectively, excluding shares withheld upon vesting of equity awards. The shares repurchased are held in treasury stock. 
 As of December 31, 2022, the remaining balance of Board approved funds for future repurchase was billion. The approval of our Board for stock repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. In addition, our Board may increase or decrease the amount available for repurchases from time to time.

 The effective tax rate in 2022 was lower than in prior years primarily due to the deferred income tax benefit from the impairment of our equity investment in Bakkt recorded in the current year, and the deferred income tax expenses recorded in prior years from U.K. tax law changes in the prior years. In 2021, the U.K. enacted a corporate income tax rate increase from 19 to 25 effective April 1, 2023. In 2020, the U.K. enacted a corporate income tax rate increase from 17 to 19 effective April 1, 2020. 
 On November 15, 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was signed into law. On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act, or ARPA, was signed into law. The ARPA enacted certain provisions that are relevant to corporate income tax. On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted and certain income tax related relief was provided under the CARES Act. These provisions did not have a material impact on our income tax provision for 2022, 2021 or 2020.

 We recognize valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of the evidence, we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of million and million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Decreases in 2022 and 2020 primarily related to taxable capital gain and certain tax attributes that expired, respectively. The increase in 2021 is primarily due to certain carried forward foreign tax attributes and foreign tax attributes generated in 2021 that became unrealizable during the year. Increases charged against goodwill in 2020 primarily relate to deferred tax assets arising on acquisitions. 
 The majority of our undistributed earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are subject to the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income provisions and, as such, are subject to immediate U.S. income taxation and can be distributed to the U.S. with no material additional income tax consequences in the future. Consequently, these earnings are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested and the related tax impact is included in our income tax provision for 2022, 2021 and 2020.

 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have gross U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of million and million, respectively, and gross state and local net operating loss carryforwards of million and million, respectively. The net decrease of federal, state and local net operating loss carryforwards are primarily due to losses utilized in the current year. The net operating loss carryforwards are available to offset future taxable income until they expire, with amounts beginning in 2026. In addition, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have gross foreign net operating loss carryforwards of million and million, respectively. The majority of gross foreign net operating losses are not expected to be realizable in future periods and have related valuation allowances.

 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the balance of unrecognized tax benefits which would, if recognized, affect our effective tax rate was million and million, respectively. It is reasonably possible, as a result of settlements of ongoing audits or statute of limitations expirations, that unrecognized tax benefits could increase as much as million and decrease as much as million within the next 12 months. Of the million in unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022, million is recorded within other non-current liabilities and million is recorded within other current liabilities. 
 We recognize interest and penalties accrued on income tax uncertainties as a component of income tax expense. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized million, million and million, respectively, of income tax expense for interest and penalties. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, accrued interest and penalties were million and million, respectively. Of the million in accrued interest and penalties as of December 31, 2022, million is recorded within other non-current liabilities and million is recorded within other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 
 We or one of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. 
 
 We have filed amended U.S. federal returns for the years prior to 2019 to claim additional credits and deductions and the associated refund claims are subject to review by the U.S. taxing authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, we believe that adequate amounts of tax, including interest and penalties, have been provided for any adjustments expected to result from open tax years.

 clearing houses, each of which acts as a central counterparty that becomes the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer for its clearing members or participants, or Members. Through this central counterparty function, the clearing houses provide financial security for each transaction for the duration of the position by limiting counterparty credit risk. 
 In 2022, we announced our decision to cease our CDS clearing service at ICE Clear Europe, our clearing house in the U.K., and thereafter our sole CDS clearing offering will be at our ICE Clear Credit clearing house in the U.S. 
 Original and Variation Margin 
 Each of the ICE Clearing Houses generally requires all Members to deposit collateral in cash or certain pledged assets. The collateral deposits are known as original margin. In addition, the ICE Clearing Houses may make intraday original margin calls in circumstances where market conditions require additional protection. The daily profits and losses to and from the ICE Clearing Houses due to the marking-to-market of open contracts is known as variation margin. With the exception of ICE NGX s physical natural gas and physical power products discussed separately below, the ICE Clearing Houses mark all outstanding contracts to market, and therefore pay and collect variation margin, at least once daily. 
 The amounts that Members are required to maintain are determined by proprietary risk models established by each ICE Clearing House and reviewed by the relevant regulators, independent model validators, risk committees and the boards of directors of the respective ICE Clearing House. The amounts required may fluctuate over time. Each of the ICE Clearing Houses is a separate legal entity and is not subject to the liabilities of the others, or the obligations of Members of the other ICE Clearing Houses. 
 Should a particular Member fail to deposit its original margin or fail to make a variation margin payment, when and as required, the relevant ICE Clearing House may liquidate or hedge the defaulting Member's open positions and use their original margin and guaranty fund deposits to pay any amount owed. In the event that the defaulting Member's deposits are not sufficient to pay the amount owed in full, the ICE Clearing Houses will first use their respective contributions to the guaranty fund, often referred to as Skin In The Game, or SITG, to pay any remaining amount owed. In the event that the SITG is not sufficient, the ICE Clearing Houses may utilize the respective guaranty fund deposits and default insurance, or collect limited additional funds from their respective non-defaulting Members on a pro-rata basis, to pay any remaining amount owed. 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the ICE Clearing Houses had received or had been pledged billion and billion, respectively, in cash and non-cash collateral in original margin and guaranty fund deposits to cover price movements of underlying contracts for both periods.

 We also maintain default insurance as an additional layer of clearing member default protection which is reflected in the table below. The default insurance was renewed in September 2022 and has a term for the following clearing houses in the following amounts: ICE Clear Europe - million; ICE Clear U.S. - million; and ICE Clear Credit - million. The default insurance layer resides after and in addition to the ICE Clear Europe, ICE Clear U.S. and ICE Clear Credit SITG contributions and before the guaranty fund contributions of the non-defaulting Members. 
 Similar to SITG, the default insurance layer is not intended to replace or reduce the position risk-based amount of the guaranty fund. As a result, the default insurance layer is not a factor that is included in the calculation of the Members guaranty fund contribution requirement. Instead, it serves as an additional, distinct, and separate default resource that should serve to further protect the non-defaulting Members guaranty fund contributions from being mutualized in the event of a default. 
 As of December 31, 2022, ICE NGX maintained a guaranty fund of million, comprising million in cash and a million letter of credit backed by a default insurance policy of the same amount, discussed below.

ICE NGX 
 ICE NGX owns a clearing house which administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts. ICE NGX is the central counterparty to Members on opposite sides of its physically-settled contracts, and the balance related to delivered but unpaid contracts is recorded as a delivery contract net receivable, with an offsetting delivery contract net payable in our balance sheets. Unsettled variation margin equal to the fair value of open contracts is recorded as of each balance sheet date. There is no impact on our consolidated statements of income as an equal amount is recognized as both an asset and a liability. ICE NGX marks all of its outstanding physical natural gas and physical power contracts to market daily, but only collects variation margin when a Member's open position falls outside a specified percentage of its pledged collateral. Due to the highly liquid nature and the short period of time to maturity, the fair values of our delivery contract net payable and net receivable are determined to approximate carrying value. 
 ICE NGX requires Members to maintain cash or letters of credit to serve as collateral in the event of default. The cash is maintained in a segregated bank account for the benefit of the Member, and remains the property of the Member and, therefore, is not included in our balance sheets. ICE NGX maintains a committed daylight-overnight liquidity facility in the amount of million with an additional million uncommitted with a third-party Canadian chartered bank which provides liquidity in the event of a settlement shortfall, subject to certain conditions. 
 During 2022, ICE NGX increased its default insurance by million, and as of December 31, 2022, ICE NGX maintains a guaranty fund of million funded by a million letter of credit issued by a major Canadian chartered bank and backed by default insurance underwritten by Export Development Canada, or EDC, a Crown corporation operated at arm s length from the Canadian government, plus million held as restricted cash to fund the first loss amount the ICE NGX is responsible for under the default insurance policy. In the event of a participant default where the Member s collateral is depleted, the shortfall would be covered by a draw down on the letter of credit following which ICE NGX would file a claim under the default insurance to recover additional losses up to million beyond the million first-loss amount that ICE NGX is responsible for under the default insurance policy.

trillion as of December 31, 2022. Each ICE Clearing House bears financial counterparty credit risk and provides a central counterparty guarantee, or performance guarantee, to its Members. To reduce their exposure, the ICE Clearing Houses have a risk management program with both initial and ongoing membership standards. Excluding the effects of original and variation margin, guaranty fund and collateral requirements and default insurance, the ICE Clearing Houses maximum estimated exposure for this guarantee is billion as of December 31, 2022, which represents the maximum estimated value by the ICE Clearing Houses of a hypothetical one-day movement in pricing of the underlying unsettled contracts. This value was determined using proprietary risk management software that simulates gains and losses based on historical market prices, volatility and other factors present at that point in time for those particular unsettled contracts. Future actual market price volatility could result in the exposure being significantly different than this amount. 
 We also performed calculations to determine the fair value of our counterparty performance guarantee taking into consideration factors such as daily settlement of contracts, margining and collateral requirements, other elements of our risk management program, historical evidence of default payments, and estimated probability of potential default payouts by the ICE Clearing Houses. Based on these analyses, the estimated counterparty performance guarantee liability was determined to be nominal and no liability was recorded as of December 31, 2022 or 2021. The ICE Clearing Houses have never experienced an incident of a clearing member default which has required the use of the guaranty funds of non-defaulting clearing members or the assets of the ICE Clearing Houses.

 . All of our leases are classified as operating leases and we do not have any leases classified as finance leases. 
 At lease inception, we review the service arrangement and components of a contract to identify if a lease or embedded lease arrangement exists. An indicator of a contract containing a lease is when we have the right to control and use an identified asset over a period of time in exchange for consideration. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We have elected the short-term lease policy to recognize leases with a term of 12 months or less as rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term and do not recognize these short-term leases on our balance sheet. We have elected the practical expedient of not separating lease and non-lease components as our lease arrangements are not highly dependent on other underlying assets. We have elected to use a portfolio approach in consideration of our incremental borrowing rate to our population of lease agreements. Certain lease agreements include options to extend, renew or terminate the lease agreement. Our lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees. As of December 31, 2022, the weighted-average remaining lease term was years and the weighted average discount rate was . As of December 31, 2021, the weighted-average remaining lease term was years and the weighted average discount rate was . Our lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees. 
 We recognized million, million and million of rent expense for office space as rent and occupancy expense in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and million, million and million for data center facilities as technology and communication expense in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, within our consolidated income statements. We do not have any significant variable lease costs related to building and maintenance costs, real estate taxes, or other charges.

 financial institutions and U.S.-based equity exchanges named as defendants in purported class action lawsuits filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, or the Southern District, by the City of Providence, Rhode Island, and other plaintiffs. In a subsequent consolidated amended complaint filed against only the exchange defendants (which include exchanges owned and operated by Nasdaq and Cboe Global Markets,Inc.), the plaintiffs asserted claims on behalf of a class of all public investors who bought or sold stock from April 18, 2009 to the present on the named exchanges. 
 In 2015, the district court granted a motion to dismiss filed by the exchange defendants and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. The court held that the plaintiffs had failed to sufficiently state a claim under Sections 10(b) and 6(b) of the Exchange Act, and additionally that some of the claims were barred by the doctrine of self-regulatory organization immunity. The plaintiffs appealed, and in 2017 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, or the Second Circuit, issued a decision vacating the dismissal and remanding the case to the district court for further proceedings. The Second Circuit held that the claims against the exchanges were not barred by the doctrine of self-regulatory organization immunity because (in the view of the Second Circuit) the exchanges were not carrying out regulatory functions while operating their markets and engaging in the challenged conduct at issue, and that the plaintiffs had adequately pleaded claims against the defendants under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act. The Second Circuit directed that, on remand, the district court should address and rule upon various other defenses raised by the exchanges in their motion to dismiss (which the district court did not address in its prior opinion and order).

virtually identical purported class action complaints were filed in the Southern District against ICE and several of its subsidiaries, including ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, or IBA, collectively referred to as the ICE Defendants, as well as multinational banks and various of their respective subsidiaries and affiliates, or the Panel Bank Defendants, by, respectively, Putnam Bank, a savings bank based in Putnam, Connecticut; municipal pension funds affiliated with the City of Livonia, Michigan; and four retirement and benefit funds affiliated with the Hawaii Sheet Metal Workers Union. IBA is the administrator for various regulated benchmarks, including the ICE LIBOR benchmark that is calculated daily based upon the submissions from a reference panel (which includes the Panel Bank Defendants). 
 The plaintiffs sought to litigate on behalf of a purported class of all U.S.-based persons or entities who transacted with a Panel Bank Defendant by receiving a payment on an interest rate indexed to a one-month or three-month USD LIBOR-benchmarked rate during the period from 2014 to 2019. The plaintiffs alleged that the ICE Defendants and the Panel Bank Defendants engaged in a conspiracy to set the LIBOR benchmark at artificially low levels, with an alleged purpose and effect of depressing payments by the Panel Bank Defendants to members of the purported class. 
 Subsequent to the filing of the individual complaints, the various plaintiffs referenced above filed a consolidated amended complaint against the ICE Defendants and the Panel Bank Defendants. As with the individual complaints, the consolidated amended complaint asserted a claim for violations of the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts and sought unspecified treble damages and other relief. The ICE Defendants and the Panel Bank Defendants filed motions to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. 
 In 2020, the court issued a decision and order granting the ICE Defendants and the Panel Bank Defendants' motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Among other things, the court found that the amended complaint is made up of almost entirely conclusory allegations and is essentially devoid of any evidence, direct or circumstantial, to support the conclusion that Defendants colluded with one another. 
 The plaintiffs appealed the decision to the Second Circuit. While briefing of the appeal was ongoing, each of the named plaintiffs withdrew from the case. DYJ Holdings, LLC, a New Jersey-based holding company, was permitted, over the objection of the defendants, to intervene for the purpose of serving as named plaintiff and representative of the purported class. 
 On February 14, 2022, the Second Circuit dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, holding that DYJ Holdings, LLC, the sole entity attempting to pursue the appeal, lacked standing to do so. The dismissal of the appeal constitutes the final resolution of this matter. 
 ICE Data Pricing Reference Data Matter 
 Our subsidiary ICE Data Pricing Reference Data, LLC, or PRD, is a registered investment advisor in the business of, among other things, providing clients with evaluated pricing and other information for fixed-income securities. PRD formerly had a business practice of passing through third-party price quotes, or broker quotes, in certain fixed income securities as-is to its clients when PRD did not believe it had the capability to model an evaluated price for such securities. Broker quoted securities were less than of the securities PRD priced. A list of securities that were broker quoted, as distinguished from evaluated, was made available to PRD s clients every day. PRD first notified its clients on December 16, 2019 that it would cease providing broker quotes and did so as of October 1, 2020.

 Separately, PRD s legacy business practices with respect to broker quotes received from a now-bankrupt entity named Live Well Financial, Inc., or Live Well, are relevant to potential civil claims against PRD. In August 2019, the SEC and the United States Department of Justice, respectively, filed civil and criminal charges against Live Well and certain of its executives, alleging that Live Well fraudulently provided over-stated broker quotes to a then-unnamed industry-leading price service (which was PRD). Certain of Live Well s financial institution creditors and its bankruptcy trustee asserted to PRD that they believed they had putative claims against PRD related to Live Well s actions. As of April 2022, PRD had resolved the potential claims of the trustee as well as all known claims of any of the financial institution creditors. With the resolution of those clams, there are no known unresolved assertions of liability against PRD relating to broker quotes PRD received from Live Well.

 t make any contributions to our pension plan during 2022, 2021 or 2020. The plan s target allocation is equity securities and fixed income securities. The fixed income allocation includes corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries and U.S. government bonds. Our long-term objective is to keep the plan at or near full funding, while minimizing the risk inherent in pension plans. As a result, we don't anticipate that there will be a strong need for contributions in future years, and the pension plan will not be required to pay the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation variable rate premiums. We do not expect to make contributions to the pension plan in 2023. We will continue to monitor the plan s funded status, and we will consider modifying the plan s investment policy based on the actuarial and funding characteristics of the retirement plan, the demographic profile of plan participants, and our business objectives.

 Fixed Income and Data Services: We provide fixed income pricing, reference data, indices, analytics and execution services, as well as global CDS clearing and multi-asset class data delivery solutions; and 
 Mortgage Technology: We provide a technology platform that offers customers comprehensive, digital workflow tools that aim to address the inefficiencies that exist in the U.S. residential mortgage market, from application through closing and the secondary market. 
 While revenues are recorded specifically in the segment in which they are earned or to which they relate, a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of more than one segment. We directly allocate expenses when reasonably possible to do so. Otherwise, we use a pro-rata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment and serve functions that are necessary for the operation of all segments.

 Basic earnings per common share is calculated using the weighted average common shares outstanding during the periods. Changes in the weighted average common shares outstanding between years was primarily due to stock repurchases. 
 Common equivalent shares from stock options and restricted stock awards, calculated using the treasury stock method, are included in the diluted per share calculations unless the effect of their inclusion would be antidilutive. During 2022, 2021 and 2020 , and outstanding stock options, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share because to do so would have had an antidilutive effect. In addition, we excluded warrants and preferred and common incentive units under the Bakkt Equity Incentive Plan in 2020 because they were also antidilutive. None of these warrants and preferred/common units were outstanding as of December 31, 2022 or 2021 due to the deconsolidation of Bakkt. As of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were restricted stock units that were vested but have not been issued that are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
