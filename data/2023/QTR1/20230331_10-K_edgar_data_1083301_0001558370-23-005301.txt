 EXPLANATORY NOTE Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements As part of the Company s financial statement close process and preparation of its Annual Report on Form 10-K (the 2022 Form 10-K ), the Company identified errors in its historical interim unaudited consolidated financial statements. The misstatements relate solely to incorrectly calculating the impact of noncash activity on purchase and deposits on plant and equipment, resulting in an understatement of net cash used in investing activities and a corresponding overstatement of net cash used in operating activities as originally included in the respective interim unaudited consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company determined that its interim unaudited consolidated financial statements for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022 (the Relevant Periods were materially misstated and needed to be restated. The restatements are set forth in detail in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Internal Control Disclosure Control Considerations Management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and identified a material weakness, resulting in the conclusion by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer that our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022. The material weakness solely relates to the inadequate design and operation of management s review controls over calculating the impact of noncash activity on purchase and deposits on plant and equipment in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Management is taking steps to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, as described in Part II, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures. Non-Reliance on Previously Filed Reports TeraWulf believes that presenting all of this information regarding the Relevant Periods in this 2022 Form 10-K allows investors to review all pertinent data in a single presentation. Therefore, we do not plan to amend our previously filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the Relevant Periods. Accordingly, investors should no longer rely upon the Company s previously released financial statements for the Relevant Periods and any earnings releases or other communications relating to these Relevant Periods. The financial information that has been previously filed or otherwise reported for the Relevant Periods is superseded by the information in this 2022 Form 10-K. TeraWulf will also correct previously reported financial information for this error in its future filings, as applicable. For discussions of the restatement adjustments, see Item 1A, Risk Factors and Item 8, Financial Statements, including Notes 2 and 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 PART I ITEM 1. Business Overview TeraWulf, Inc. TeraWulf , the Company , our or we is a digital asset technology company with a core business of digital infrastructure and energy development to enable sustainable bitcoin mining. TeraWulf develops, owns and operates its bitcoin mining facility sites in the United States using nuclear, hydro and solar energy sources, currently consuming over 91 zero-carbon energy, with a target of 100 zero-carbon energy by 2028. TeraWulf began trading on Nasdaq under the symbol WULF on December 14, 2021, following its successful strategic business combination with RM 101 Inc. (formerly known as IKONICS Corporation). TeraWulf commenced industrial scale bitcoin mining in March 2022 and is currently operating two near zero-carbon data centers in New York and Pennsylvania, the Lake Mariner Facility and the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility, respectively. TeraWulf began mining bitcoin at the Lake Mariner Facility in March 2022 and at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility in February 2023. As of March 30, 2023, these two industrial-scale projects had a self-mining hash rate of 2.8 exahash per second EH/s with approximately 28,000 miners currently deployed, comprised of 18,000 operational miners at the Lake Mariner Facility (13,000 self-miners and 5,000 hosted miners) and 10,000 self-miners at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility. TeraWulf s facilities are expected to reach an aggregate 160 MW of net bitcoin mining capacity with a capacity to support 50,000 miners and over 5.5 EH/s of computational power in the second quarter of 2023. Our primary source of revenue is from sustainably mining bitcoin at our bitcoin mining facility sites. We also earn revenue from miner hosting services to third parties. We do not hold, sell or transact in bitcoin or any other digital assets for anyone other than ourselves. We do not hedge our bitcoin. Our industrial scale bitcoin mining operations focus on maximizing our ability to successfully mine bitcoin by growing our hash rate (the amount of computer power we devote to supporting the bitcoin blockchain) to increase our chances of successfully finding cryptographic hashes that create new blocks on the bitcoin blockchain (a process known as solving a block ). Generally, the greater share of the bitcoin blockchain s total network hash rate (the aggregate hash rate deployed to solving a block on the bitcoin blockchain) represented by a miner s hash rate, the greater the miner s chances of solving a block and therefore earning the block reward, which is currently 6.25 bitcoin plus transaction fees per block. As additional miner operators enter the market in response to increased demand for bitcoin, the bitcoin blockchain s network hash rate grows. The majority of our revenue comes from our self-mined bitcoin, which we store and safeguard in a cold storage wallet held by our custodian, NYDIG Trust Company LLC NYDIG ), a duly chartered New York limited liability trust company. We participate in a mining pool operated by Foundry Digital LLC Foundry ), and at the end of each day, our earned bitcoin is sent by Foundry to our wallet address custodied with NYDIG. Any bitcoin mined by third-party miners hosted at our Lake Mariner Data LLC Lake Mariner facility site is either (1) delivered directly into the third-party miners wallets, which we have neither access to nor oversight over, or (2) delivered into our wallet held by NYDIG, pursuant to the mined bitcoin sharing arrangements agreed to in our respective miner hosting agreements. To the extent we sell any of our mined bitcoin, we do so using NYDIG Execution LLC NYDIG Execution ), a Delaware LLC registered as a Money Services Business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and licensed with a BitLicense by the New York State Department of Financial Services. Funds from the sale of our bitcoin by NYDIG Execution are deposited by NYDIG Execution directly into the Company s bank account at a U.S. depository institution. We do not currently sell or intend to sell our bitcoin on any exchange. Instead, we rely on NYDIG Execution to sell any of our mined bitcoin, pursuant to our execution agreement with NYDIG which is described further in the section titled Risk Factors herein. We sell bitcoin on a daily, weekly and monthly basis to pay for all operating expenses of the Company. As described further in the section titled Risk Factors herein, even though we do not hold any cryptocurrency on others behalf and do not currently sell or intend to sell our cryptocurrency on exchanges, our business, financial condition and results of operations may still be adversely affected by recent industry-wide developments beyond our control, including the continued industry-wide fallout from (i) the recent ceasing of operations by Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank SBNY and Silvergate Bank and (ii) the recent Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings of cryptocurrency exchange FTX Trading Ltd., et al. FTX (including its affiliated hedge fund Alameda Research LLC), crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital Three Arrows and crypto lenders Celsius Network LLC, et al. Celsius ), Voyager Digital Ltd., et al. Voyager ), BlockFi Inc., et al. BlockFi and Genesis Global Holdco, LLC, et al. Genesis ). While we have no exposure to FTX, Three Arrows, Celsius, Voyager or BlockFi, Genesis is owned by Digital Currency

 Group Inc. DCG ), who also owns Foundry, our mining pool provider. At this time, there are no material risks to our business arising from our indirect exposure to Genesis. Most recently, in March 2023, SVB Financial, the parent of Silicon Valley Bank, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. We have no material direct exposure to SVB Financial, Silicon Valley Bank or Silvergate Bank. Although (i) our cryptocurrency mining business has (x) no direct exposure to any of the cryptocurrency market participants that recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and (y) no material direct exposure to SVB Financial, Silicon Valley Bank or Silvergate Bank; (ii) we have no assets, material or otherwise, that may not be recovered due to the foregoing bankruptcies or bank shutdowns; (iii) we have no direct exposure to any other counterparties, customers, custodians or other financial institutions or crypto asset market participants known to have (x) experienced excessive redemptions or suspended redemptions or withdrawal of crypto assets, (y) the crypto assets of their customers unaccounted for, or (z) experienced material corporate compliance failures; and (iv) our activities in the commercial optimization of the power supply are unaffected by the recent crypto market and banking industry events; our business, financial condition and results of operations may not be immune to unfavorable investor sentiment resulting from these recent developments in the broader cryptocurrency and banking industries. On March 12, 2023, Signature Bank SBNY was closed by its state chartering authority, the New York State Department of Financial Services. On the same date the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC was appointed as receiver and transferred all customer deposits and substantially all of the assets of SBNY to Signature Bridge Bank, N.A., a full-service bank that is being operated by the FDIC. The FDIC, the U.S. Treasury, and the Federal Reserve jointly announced that all depositors of SBNY would be made whole, regardless of deposit insurance limits. The Company automatically became a customer of Signature Bridge Bank, N.A. as part of this action. Normal banking activities resumed on Monday, March 13, 2023. On March 29, 2023, the Company was advised by the FDIC that the Company s bank accounts would be closed on April 5, 2023 and any remaining funds as of that date would be distributed to the Company by check. As of March 30, 2023, the Company held approximately 0.9 million in the former SBNY accounts and intends to transfer all then remaining funds out of Signature Bridge Bank, N.A. by April 5, 2023. Corporate History and Structure Paul Prager, Chief Executive Officer CEO and chairman of the board of directors of TeraWulf, co-founded TeraWulf with Nazar Khan, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Technology Officer, in 2021. Together with Kerri Langlais, Chief Strategy Officer, the TeraWulf management team has worked together for over 15 years. TeraWulf s business operations are conducted through several operating subsidiaries with its core operational and business activities directed through TeraWulf. The chart below sets forth TeraWulf s corporate structure as of the date of this Annual Report. All entities on the chart have been incorporated in the State of Delaware or Minnesota as either corporations or limited liability companies, as the case may be, as indicated on the chart:

 RM 101 Inc. (formerly known as IKONICS Corporation) TeraWulf completed its business combination with RM 101 Inc. (formerly known as IKONICS Corporation) on December 13, 2021 (the Closing Date pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger, dated as of June 24, 2021 (as amended, the Merger Agreement ). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of RM 101 Inc. (formerly known as IKONICS Corporation) common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Closing Date was automatically converted into and exchanged for (i) one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of TeraWulf, (ii) one contractual contingent value right (each, a CVR pursuant to the Contingent Value Rights Agreement between TeraWulf and RM 101 Inc. (formerly known as IKONICS Corporation) (the CVR Agreement and (iii) the right to receive 5.00 in cash, without interest. The TeraWulf Advantage: Vertically integrated, Zero-Carbon Bitcoin Miner Vertical Integration . TeraWulf owns 100 of the Lake Mariner Facility and 25 of the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility. TeraWulf believes its ownership of its bitcoin mining facility sites is vital to its success, as it maximizes efficiency and reduces production cost. Energy infrastructure assets are complex and require specialized equipment, numerous commercial relationships, and diverse stakeholder groups. Ownership of its mining sites allows TeraWulf to take a wholistic approach to ensure projects are completed safely, timely, and reliably. In addition, vertical integration allows TeraWulf to be good stewards of the environment and the communities in which it operates. Furthermore, ownership enhances the ability to actively manage site development, the project supply chain, and commercial arrangements. Most importantly, it provides employees, investors, and communities accountability and transparency. Environmentally Clean . TeraWulf s strategy is to be the market leader for sustainable bitcoin mining. TeraWulf s two bitcoin mining facilities are currently powered by more than 91 zero-carbon energy with a goal of utilizing 100 zero-carbon energy. The Nautilus Cryptomine Facility is powered by 100 zero-carbon nuclear energy and the Lake Mariner Facility in New York sources power in Western New York where over 91 of market energy comes from zero-carbon resources, primarily hydro and nuclear. Given the power-intensive nature of bitcoin mining and the implications for the environment, TeraWulf believes that its access to inexpensive, zero-carbon power represents a meaningful and durable competitive advantage for the Company relative to its publicly traded bitcoin mining peers. Low Cost Energy Supply . TeraWulf expects to have one of the lowest electricity costs among its publicly traded bitcoin mining peers at approximately 0.035 per kilowatt-hour, augmenting TeraWulf s competitive position in varying bitcoin price environments. The Nautilus Cryptomine Facility benefits from a contracted, fixed price of power of 0.02 per kilowatt-hour for a term of five years. TeraWulf anticipates the market cost of power at the Lake Mariner Facility will average approximately 0.045 per kilowatt-hour. TeraWulf s Lake Mariner Facility and the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility are located at structurally congested points in their respective markets and may increase power optimization opportunities and the ability to provide ancillary services to the electrical distribution grid. Scale Rapidly with Proprietary Expansion Pipeline . TeraWulf s ability to achieve scale in its mining operations is driven by its access to state-of-the-art miners, ability to structure competitive power supply arrangements, and deep energy infrastructure and operational expertise. TeraWulf has the ability to significantly expand mining operations at its existing site. The Lake Mariner Facility has the ability to expand another 80 MW in the near term, and up to 500 MW in total. TeraWulf also retains the option to expand its mining capacity at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility by 50 MW. In addition to its proprietary expansion capacity, TeraWulf has developed a strong, collaborative relationship with the leading mining equipment manufacturer, Bitmain. This strategic relationship supports preferred access and advantaged cost structures for Bitmain s ASIC miners. Experienced Team . TeraWulf is supported by Beowulf Electricity Data Inc. Beowulf E D ), a company controlled by TeraWulf s CEO, to ensure an efficient buildout of its bitcoin mining facility sites. In addition, members of the Beowulf E D team have over thirty years of experience overseeing the buildout and operation of large-scale energy facilities, which experience lends itself to the buildout of TeraWulf s new bitcoin mining facilities. The Lake Mariner Facility is designed as replicable, reliable and cost-effective data centers for housing ASICs, but also designed with modular functionality to allow installation of a portion of ASICs prior to the completion of the facility. Human Capital Management As of March 30, 2023, TeraWulf had eight full-time employees. TeraWulf s human capital resource objectives include identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating TeraWulf s employees, advisors and consultants. TeraWulf provides

Table of Contents 
 employees the opportunity to advance professionally and to be rewarded commensurate with results. As TeraWulf is a small team of only eight employees, TeraWulf also uses its affiliate Beowulf E D s human capital resources for support pursuant to the administrative and infrastructure services agreement. Beowulf E D, along with TeraWulf, is focused on ESG and diversity initiatives, and both companies share similar goals, corporate standards and governance practices as a result of their affiliated relationship. The principal purpose of TeraWulf s 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan is to attract, retain and motivate employees, executive officers and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards. Planned Mining Operations TeraWulf commenced industrial scale bitcoin mining in March 2022 and is currently operating two near zero-carbon data centers in New York and Pennsylvania. TeraWulf began mining bitcoin at the Lake Mariner Facility in March 2022 and at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility in February 2023. As of March 30, 2023, these two industrial-scale projects had a self-mining hash rate of 2.8 EH/s with approximately 28,000 miners currently deployed, comprised of 18,000 operational miners at the Lake Mariner Facility (13,000 self-miners and 5,000 hosted miners) and 10,000 self-miners at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility. TeraWulf s facilities are expected to reach an aggregate 160 MW of net bitcoin mining capacity with a capacity to support 50,000 miners and over 5.5 EH/s of computational power in the second quarter of 2023. Lake Mariner Facility Located at a site adjacent to the decommissioned coal-fired Somerset Generating Station in Barker, New York, the Lake Mariner Facility has secured an initial 90 MW of energy to support its bitcoin mining capacity through an agreement with the New York Power Authority NYPA with the potential to expand into an additional 410 MW of energy supply. The Lake Mariner Facility began mining operations in March 2022 and as of March 30, 2023, has approximately 60 MW of operational mining capacity, representing approximately 18,000 miners. TeraWulf expects to reach 110 MW of mining capacity at the facility, representing approximately 34,000 miners, in the second quarter of 2023 pending the completion of construction of Building 2, which will add another 50 MW of mining capacity. The Lake Mariner Facility has the ability to expand another 80 MW in the near term, and up to 500 MW in total. Nautilus Cryptomine Facility Co-located with the 2.5 GW nuclear-powered Susquehanna Steam Electric Station in Berwick, Pennsylvania (the Susquehanna Station ), 2.3 GW of which are owned and operated by Talen Energy Corporation Talen ), the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility nuclear-powered bitcoin mining facility with a current capacity of 200 MW. The Nautilus Cryptomine is a joint venture between TeraWulf and Cumulus Coin, LLC, a subsidiary of Talen. TeraWulf owns a 25 equity interest in the facility, which represents 50 MW of mining capacity. The Nautilus Cryptomine Facility is not connected to the electrical distribution grid, but is rather behind-the-meter , thereby avoiding transmission and distribution charges typically paid by other large power consumers. The Nautilus Cryptomine Facility receives nuclear power directly from a substation connected to the Susquehanna Station s electrical generators, which is contractually priced at a fixed cost of 0.02 per kilowatt-hour over a five-year term with two successive three-year renewal options. The Nautilus Cryptomine Facility commenced mining in February 2023 and as of March 30, 2023, TeraWulf has approximately 10,000 miners energized, representing approximately 1.0 EH/S of self-mining capacity. TeraWulf expects to reach its full 50 MW capacity at the facility, representing approximately 16,000 miners, in the second quarter of 2023. TeraWulf has the option to add an additional 50 MW of bitcoin mining capacity, for a total of 100 MW, at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility. Subject to strategic development plans and the prevailing market prices and mining economics of bitcoin, TeraWulf s management and board of directors may decide to exchange bitcoin for fiat currency through over-the-counter providers or exchanges to fund operations and future growth. While TeraWulf has relationships with over-the-counter providers and digital asset exchanges, TeraWulf does not have a contractual obligation as of the date of this Annual Report to convert bitcoin into fiat currency using any one provider and/or exchange. Currency exchange fees vary by provider and amount of digital asset being converted. TeraWulf anticipates conversion fees to the third-party providers to be in the range of approximately 0 to 0.25 . As of the date of this Annual Report, TeraWulf does not plan to convert bitcoin into other digital assets.

 Loan, Guaranty and Security Agreement On December 1, 2021, TeraCub entered into a Loan, Guaranty and Security Agreement with Wilmington Trust, National Association as administrative agent (the LGSA ). The LGSA consists of a 123.5 million term loan facility (the Term Loan ). On December 14, 2021, TeraWulf executed a joinder agreement whereby it effectively became the successor borrower to TeraCub and assumed all obligations under the LGSA. The Company is required to pay the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan in quarterly installments, commencing in April 2023, equal to 12.5 of the original principal amount of the Term Loan. The maturity date of the Term Loan is December 1, 2024. The Term Loan bears an interest rate of 11.5 and an upfront fee of 1 , an amount of approximately 1.2 million. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, as defined, the applicable interest rate will be 13.5 . Interest payments are due quarterly in arrears. The Company has the option to prepay all or any portion of the Term Loan in increments of at least 5.0 million subject to certain prepayment fees, including: (1) if paid prior to the first anniversary of the LGSA, a make whole amount based on the present value of the unpaid interest that would have been paid on the prepaid principal amount over the first year of the Term Loan, (2) if paid subsequent to the first anniversary of the LGSA but prior to the second anniversary of the LGSA, an amount of 3 of the prepaid principal and (3) if paid subsequent to the second anniversary of the LGSA but prior to the maturity date of the LGSA, an amount of 2 of the prepaid principal. Certain events, as described in the LGSA, require mandatory prepayment. The Term Loan is guaranteed by TeraWulf Inc. and TeraCub and its subsidiaries, as defined, and is collateralized by substantially all of the properties, rights and assets of TeraWulf Inc. and TeraCub and its subsidiaries (except IKONICS), as defined. One Term Loan investor, NovaWulf Digital Master Fund, L.P., with a principal balance of 15.0 million, is a related party due to cumulative voting control by members of Company management and a member of the Company s board of directors. In July 2022, NovaWulf Digital Master Fund, L.P. transferred a principal balance of 13.0 million of the Term Loan to NovaWulf Digital Private Fund LLC. In connection with the LGSA, the Company issued to the holders of the Term Loans 839,398 shares of Common Stock (the Term Loan Equity ). On July 1, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to the LGSA. This amendment provides for an additional 50.0 million term loan facility (the New Term Facility ). The New Term Facility has a maturity date of December 1, 2024, consistent with the existing term loans under the LGSA. The interest rate with respect to the New Term Facility is consistent with the existing term loans under the LGSA, but the interest rate under the amended LGSA may be increased, if applicable, to the cash interest rate on any junior capital raised plus 8.5 , if higher. No interest rate adjustment has been made under this provision. Pursuant to the New Term Facility, funds can be drawn in three tranches. The 15.0 million first tranche (the First Amendment Term Loan was drawn at closing in July 2022, and the subsequent tranches of up to 35 million (the Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitment may be drawn at Company s option prior to December 31, 2022, subject to certain conditions, including the raising of matching junior capital, as defined. The amortization with respect to the first tranche of the New Term Facility is consistent with existing term loans under the LGSA. The loans under the subsequent tranches of the New Term Facility are repayable in quarterly installments on (i) April 5, 2024 and July 8, 2024, equal to 12.50 of the original principal amount advanced under such tranches under the LGSA and (ii) October 7, 2024, equal to 37.5 of the original principal amount advanced under such tranches of the LGSA. The New Term Facility required the Company to extend the initial term of the Ground Lease from five years to eight years. The prepayment provisions remain unchanged for the Term Loan. If the New Term Facility is repaid within 121 days of July 1, 2022, then a 3 prepayment penalty is due. A prepayment thereafter results in no prepayment penalty. In connection with the New Term Facility, the Company paid an upfront fee of 125,000 and issued warrants to the lenders under the New Term Facility to purchase 5,787,732 shares of Common Stock at 0.01 per share, an aggregate number of shares of the Company s Common Stock equal to 5.0 (comprised of 2 related to the Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitment and 3 related to the First Amendment Term Loan) of the then fully diluted equity of the Company (the Lender Warrants ). If the Company draws subsequent tranches, it is required to issue warrants to the lenders to purchase shares of the Company s Common Stock equal to dilution of 3.75 upon the issuance of a second tranche in the amount of 15.0 million and 4.25 upon issuance of a third tranche in the amount of 20.0 million, in each case as a percentage of the then fully diluted equity of the Company, respectively. A certain portion of the Lender Warrants were subject to cancellation, upon the occurrence of certain conditions, but based on the passage of time no cancellation provisions remain effective. The Lender Warrants were subject to certain vesting restrictions, which expired on September 30, 2022 or October 30, 2022. On August 26, 2022, TeraWulf Inc. (the Company entered into a second amendment (the Second Amendment to the LGSA. The LGSA, as amended, required the Company to maintain or meet certain affirmative, negative, financial and reporting covenants. The affirmative covenants include, among other things, a requirement for the Company to maintain insurance coverage, maintain mining equipment and comply in all material respects with the Company s Nautilus joint venture agreement. The negative covenants restrict or limit the Company s ability to, among other things, incur debt, create liens, divest or acquire assets, make restricted payments and permit the Company s interest in the Nautilus joint venture to be reduced below 25 .

 On October 7, 2022, the Company entered into a third amendment (the Third Amendment to the LGSA, which divided the initial funding of up to 15,000,000 of the Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitment into two tranches of up to 7,500,000 each. The first tranche of 7,500,000 was borrowed upon the effectiveness of the Third Amendment on October 7, 2022. On the same date, the Company also entered into an amendment and restatement of that certain warrant agreement with respect to the Lender Warrants, which provided for their immediate exercisability. On January 27, 2023, the Company entered into a binding term sheet with its lenders (the Term Sheet pursuant to which the parties agreed to make certain amendments to the LGSA via a fifth amendment (the Fifth Amendment ). The Term Sheet provided for the elimination of mandatory amortization of the term loan through April 8, 2024, subject to certain conditions, including the completion of one or more equity capital raises with aggregate net proceeds of at least 33.5 million by March 15, 2023 (such aggregate capital raise, the Qualified Equity Capital Raise ). The Company satisfied the Qualified Equity Capital Raise condition on March 9, 2023. The Term Sheet also provided for an excess cash flow sweep in place of scheduled principal payments, which will automatically extend to the maturity of the term loan on December 1, 2024 in the event the Company repays at least 40 million of the term loan by April 1, 2024. The modifications to the term loan s amortization schedule are also contingent on the Company complying with certain corporate governance provisions, and that no default or event of default has occurred or is occurring under the term loan. On March 1, 2023 (the Fifth Amendment Effective Date ), the conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the Fifth Amendment were satisfied and the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment. Also, on March 1, 2023, in connection with the execution of the Fifth Amendment, the Company entered into a Warrant Agreement (the Fifth Amendment Warrant Agreement to issue the following warrants to the lenders: (i) 26,666,669 warrants to purchase an aggregate number of shares of the Company s common stock equal to 10.0 of the fully diluted equity of the Company as of the Fifth Amendment Effective Date with an exercise price of 0.01 per share of the Company s common stock (the Lender Penny Warrants and (ii) 13,333,333 warrants to purchase an aggregate number of shares of the Company s common stock equal to 5.0 of the fully diluted equity of the Company as of the Fifth Amendment Effective Date with an exercise price of 1.00 per share of the Company s common stock (the Lender Dollar Warrants ). Both the Lender Penny Warrants and the Lender Dollar Warrants are subject to anti-dilution protection for any additional capital raising transaction by the Company of up to 5.0 million following the completion of the Qualified Equity Capital Raise. The Lender Penny Warrants are exercisable during the period beginning on April 1, 2024 and ending at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 31, 2025, and the Lender Dollar Warrants are exercisable during the period beginning on April 1, 2024 and ending at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 31, 2026. Also, on March 1, 2023, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement in respect of the Lender Penny Warrants and the Lender Dollar Warrants which provides the lenders with customary shelf and piggyback registration rights. The Lender Penny Warrants and the Lender Dollar Warrants were issued in a private placement transaction exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) and/or Regulation D under the Securities Act. Intellectual Property TeraWulf actively uses specific hardware and software for its bitcoin mining operations. In certain cases, source code and other software assets may be subject to an open-source license due to the fact that the majority of the technology in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors is open source For these works, we adhere to the terms of any license agreements that may be in place. TeraWulf does not currently own, and does not have any current plans to seek, any patents in connection with its existing and planned blockchain and cryptocurrency related operations. TeraWulf relies upon trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights and other intellectual property rights and expects to license the use of intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others. In the future, TeraWulf may develop certain proprietary software applications for purposes of its blockchain and cryptocurrency related operations. TeraWulf owns the internet domain name www.terawulf.com . Information on, or accessible through, TeraWulf s website, or any other website accessible through TeraWulf s website, is not incorporated by reference into, and does not form a part of, this Annual Report and is intended to be inactive textual reference only. Competition Bitcoin mining is an increasingly competitive industry comprised of companies and organizations of varying scale and sophistication. There has been a significant increase in the number of commercial bitcoin miners attempting to expand and scale their mining operations, which in turn has contributed to increasing the global network s total hash power. As more hashing capability is added to the bitcoin network, the revenue generating potential of TeraWulf s miners could be negatively affected. Additionally, as more bitcoin miners enter the industry, TeraWulf may experience additional pressure on profitability and ability to scale operations, due to greater competition for access to miners, mining locations, and infrastructure components.

 TeraWulf believes that it addresses many of these risks with its infrastructure-first and vertically integrated strategy, which leverages several key components. The Company has secured several long-term, low-cost energy supply contracts at the sites which it controls directly or through joint venture agreements. Terawulf also receives its miners from different suppliers where its multi-sourcing strategy provides greater alternatives than many peers for supply of this critical component to the mining industry. TeraWulf management s decades of experience in designing, developing and operating energy infrastructure also enables the Company and its affiliate Beowulf E D to construct world-class mining facilities that can host miners on a compressed timeline while minimizing construction and operating expenses. Government Regulation Government regulation of blockchain and cryptocurrency mining industries is being actively considered by the United States federal government via several agencies and regulatory bodies as well as similar entities in other countries. State government regulations also may apply to TeraWulf s activities and other activities in which TeraWulf participates or may participate in the future. Other regulatory bodies are governmental or semi-governmental and have shown an interest in regulating or investigating companies engaged in the blockchain or cryptocurrency mining business. Businesses that are engaged in the transmission and custody of bitcoin and other digital assets, including brokers and custodians, can be subject to the regulations of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury as money services businesses as well as state money transmitter licensing requirements. Bitcoin and other digital assets are subject to anti-fraud regulations under federal and state commodity laws, and digital asset derivative instruments are substantively regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Certain jurisdictions, including, among others, the State of New York and a number of countries outside the United States, have developed regulatory requirements specifically for digital assets and companies that transact in them. Regulations may change substantially in the future, and it is presently not possible to know how regulations will apply to TeraWulf s business or when they will become effective. As the regulatory and legal environments evolve, TeraWulf may become subject to new laws and further regulation by the SEC and other agencies, which may affect its mining and other activities. For instance, various bills have been proposed in the U.S. Congress related to TeraWulf s business, which may be adopted and have an impact on TeraWulf. See Risk Factors for additional discussion regarding TeraWulf s belief about the potential risks that existing and future regulations pose to its business. On March 2, 2022, the United States announced plans to establish a unified federal regulatory regime for cryptocurrency, and a group of United States Senators sent a letter to the United States Treasury Department asking Treasury Secretary Yellen to investigate Treasury s ability to monitor and restrict the use of cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions imposed by the United States. In September 2022, the White House issued a report regarding the Climate and Energy Implications of Crypto-Assets in the United States. The report states that the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency should initiate a process to solicit data and develop environmental performance and energy conservation standards for crypto-asset technologies, including mining equipment. Should such measures prove ineffective at achieving the Administration s environmental goals, the report calls for the Administration to explore executive actions and legislation to limit or eliminate the use of high energy intensity consensus mechanisms for crypto-asset mining. We are unable to predict the impact that any new standards, legislation, or regulations may have on our business at the time of filing this Annual Report. We continue to monitor and proactively engage in dialogue on regulatory and legislative matters related to our industry. Further, in December 2022 the SEC s Division of Corporation Finance issued guidance advising companies to disclose exposure and risk to the cryptocurrency market. While the focus is on digital asset managers and exchanges, and not bitcoin miners, the failure of such large asset managers and exchanges may create increased price volatility of bitcoin. TeraWulf does not store our bitcoin on such exchanges; however, we may be impacted by such failures. In January 2023, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation issued a joint statement discouraging banks from doing business with clients in crypto-asset industries. In January 2023, the Federal Reserve also issued a policy statement broadening its authority to cover state-chartered banks.

 Also in January 2023, the House of Representatives announced its first ever Financial Services Subcommittee on Digital Assets and the intention to develop a regulatory framework for the digital asset industry. The bipartisan leadership of the Senate Banking Committee announced that goal as well. As the regulatory and legal environment evolves, we may become subject to new laws, such as further regulation by the SEC and other agencies, which may affect our mining and other activities. For additional discussion regarding our belief about the potential risks existing and future regulation pose to our business, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report. Additionally, we are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and analogous state and provincial agencies issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, which often require stringent and costly compliance measures. These laws and regulations may, among other things, require the acquisition of permits; govern the amounts and types of substances that may be released into the environment in connection with our operations; restrict the way we handle or dispose of our materials and wastes; or require investigatory and remedial actions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations, or the possible issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting our activities. In addition, some laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose liability for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault. Complying with these regulatory requirements may increase our cost of doing business and consequently affect our profitability. Moreover, environmental laws and regulations have been subject to frequent changes over the years, and the imposition of more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position. We believe that our existing environmental control procedures are adequate and we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures in this area that would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Risk Factor Summary An investment in shares of our common stock involves substantial risks and uncertainties that may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. Some of the more significant challenges and risks relating to an investment in our Company are summarized below. The following is only a summary of the principal risks that may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The following should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the risk factors we face, which are set forth below. See Item 1A Risk Factors. 
 If TeraWulf is unable to successfully maintain its Equipment Supply Agreements on acceptable terms or at all, TeraWulf s business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. Since the development, construction and operation of the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility is subject to the terms of a joint venture agreement, TeraWulf may have less control over strategic decisions. The digital asset exchanges on which cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, trade are relatively new and largely unregulated, and thus may be exposed to fraud and failure. Such failures may result in a reduction in the price of bitcoin, or even cause the market for bitcoin to disappear entirely, which would adversely affect an investment in us. TeraWulf may need to raise additional capital to meet its business requirements in the future, which capital raising may be costly or difficult to obtain or may not be obtained (in whole or in part) and, if obtained, could significantly dilute the ownership interests of TeraWulf s shareholders.

 Our liquidity has been substantially dependent on our financing efforts and our business could be materially adversely affected by limited liquidity in the future. We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which may, if not effectively remediated, result in additional material misstatements in our financial statements. Although our digital assets are only stored using cold storage, we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to our digital asset custodian, NYDIG Trust Company LLC. We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to our mining pool operator, Foundry Digital LLC. If the value of bitcoin declines precipitously, the value of our collateral under our Loan, Guaranty and Security Agreement with Wilmington Trust, National Association as administrative agent may also decline, and we would face increased losses or impairments in our investments and other assets. Security threats or unauthorized or impermissible access to our datacenters, our operations or our digital wallet from U.S. or non-U.S. actors could result in a loss of our bitcoin and assets or cause damage to our reputation, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Digital assets, such as bitcoin, may become regulated as securities or investment securities. The further development and acceptance of digital asset networks and other digital assets, which represent a new and rapidly changing industry, are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate, and the slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of digital asset systems may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. If demand for transactions in bitcoin declines and is replaced by new demand for other cryptocurrencies, the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Significant contributors to all or any digital asset network could propose amendments to the respective network s protocols and software that, if accepted and authorized by such network, could adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. The open-source structure of the bitcoin network protocol means that the contributors to the protocol are generally not directly compensated for their contributions in maintaining and developing the bitcoin network protocol, and a failure to properly monitor and upgrade the protocol could damage the bitcoin network and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations If a malicious actor or botnet obtains control in excess of 50 of the processing power active on any digital asset network, including the bitcoin network, it is possible that such actor or botnet could manipulate the blockchain in a manner that may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. If the award of digital assets for solving blocks and transaction fees for recording transactions are not sufficiently high to cover expenses related to running data center operations, it may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that the profit margins of digital asset mining operations are not high, operators of digital asset mining operations are more likely to immediately sell their digital assets earned by mining in the digital asset exchange market, resulting in a reduction in the price of digital assets that may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that any miners cease to record transactions in solved blocks, transactions that do not include the payment of a transaction fee will not be recorded on the blockchain until a block is solved by a miner who does not require the payment of transaction fees, and any widespread delays in the recording of transactions could result in a loss of confidence in that digital asset network, which may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. Intellectual property rights claims may adversely affect the operation of some or all digital asset networks. To the extent that the digital asset exchanges representing a substantial portion of the volume in digital asset trading are involved in fraud or experience security failures or other operational issues, such digital asset exchanges failures may result in a reduction in the price of some or all digital assets and may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Political or economic crises may motivate large-scale sales of digital assets, which could result in a reduction in some or all digital assets values and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company s ability to adopt technology in response to changing security needs or trends poses a challenge to the safekeeping of the Company s digital assets. Digital asset transactions are irrevocable, and stolen or incorrectly transferred digital assets may be irretrievable and, as a result, any incorrectly executed digital asset transactions may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. The limited rights of legal recourse against the Company, and the Company s lack of insurance protection, exposes the Company and its stockholders to the risk of loss of its digital assets for which no person is liable. The Company may not have adequate sources of recovery if its digital assets are lost, stolen or destroyed. Digital assets held by the Company are not subject to FDIC or SIPC protections. The loss or destruction of a private key required to access a digital asset may be irreversible and, as a result, the Company s loss of access to its private keys or its experience of a data loss relating to its digital assets may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. Because many of the Company s digital assets are held by digital asset exchanges, it faces heightened risks from cybersecurity attacks and financial stability of digital asset exchanges. As the number of digital assets awarded for solving a block in the blockchain decreases, the incentive for miners to continue to contribute processing power to the respective digital asset network will transition from a set reward to transaction fees. The price of bitcoin may be influenced by regulatory, commercial and technical factors that are highly uncertain resulting in the price of bitcoin being extremely volatile, which may significantly influence the market price of the Company s common stock. The sale of the Company s digital assets to pay expenses at a time of low digital asset prices may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. The development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to use alternative distributed ledgers or other alternatives. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrency systems may lead to slow or inadequate responses to crises, which may negatively affect our business. We are subject to a highly-evolving regulatory landscape and any adverse changes to, or our failure to comply with, any laws and regulations could adversely affect our business, reputation, prospects or operations. TeraWulf may be at a higher risk of litigation and other legal proceedings due to heightened regulatory scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry, which could ultimately be resolved against TeraWulf, requiring material future cash payments or charges, which could impair TeraWulf s financial condition and results of operations. The Company may be classified as an inadvertent investment company. It may be illegal now, or in the future, to acquire, own, hold, sell or use digital assets in one or more countries, and ownership of, holding or trading in the Company s securities may also be considered illegal and subject to sanction. If regulatory changes or interpretations of the Company s activities require its registration as a money services business under the regulations promulgated by FinCEN under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended, the Company may be required to register and comply with such regulations. Blockchain technology may expose the Company to specially designated nationals or blocked persons or cause it to violate provisions of law. The Company may be required to register and comply with bitcoin regulations and, to the extent that the Company decides to continue operations, the required registrations and regulatory compliance steps may result in extraordinary expenses to the Company.

 If federal or state legislatures or agencies initiate or release tax determinations that change the classification of bitcoins as property for tax purposes (in the context of when such bitcoins are held as an investment), such determination could have a negative tax consequence on the Company or its shareholders. Under certain recently proposed legislation, substantial tax compliance burdens may be imposed on the Company relating to the tax reporting of bitcoin and bitcoin-related transactions. The Company s bitcoin holdings could subject it to regulatory scrutiny. Due to the unregulated nature and lack of transparency surrounding the operations of many bitcoin trading venues, they may experience fraud, security failures or operational problems, which may adversely affect the value of the Company s bitcoin holdings. If we fail to regain compliance with the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, our common stock may be delisted and the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted. We do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. The market price of our Common Stock may be volatile as a result of recent geopolitical, economic or industry-wide developments, which could subject us to securities class action litigation and result in substantial losses for our stockholders. ITEM 1A. Risk Factors Our business faces many risks. Before deciding whether to invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in this Annual Report. If any of the risks or uncertainties described herein actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we have described are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations. Risks Related to Our Business If TeraWulf is unable to successfully maintain its Equipment Supply Agreements on acceptable terms or at all, TeraWulf s business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. Mining bitcoin requires access to massive amounts of electrical power and relationships with leading mining equipment manufacturers. Furthermore, consistent with TeraWulf s carbon mandate, TeraWulf s activities must be supported by sustainable energy sources. A limited number of suppliers produce mining equipment to power sustainable industrial-scale mining. Any shortage of mining equipment may negatively impact the viability and expected economic return for TeraWulf s bitcoin mining activities. TeraWulf has structured and secured competitive equipment supply agreements to purchase state-of-the-art mining equipment from Bitmain and MinerVA. Since its inception, TeraWulf has executed an equipment purchase agreement with MinerVA, four non-fixed price sales and purchase agreements with Bitmain and five future sales and purchase agreements with Bitmain. TeraWulf will be highly dependent on the MinerVA agreement and the Bitmain agreements (collectively, the Equipment Supply Agreements for the development of its business models. TeraWulf cannot guarantee that it will ultimately be able to successfully consummate the transactions contemplated by the Equipment Supply Agreements on terms acceptable to both TeraWulf s management team and Bitmain or MinerVA, as applicable. Despite securing Equipment Supply Agreements that provide for delivery of an aggregate total of 44,450 miners between January 2022 and March 2023, such Equipment Supply Agreements are subject to uncertain contractual provisions that could, under certain conditions, leave TeraWulf without adequate or sufficient equipment for its mining operations. Under the Equipment Supply Agreements, the total purchase price is an estimated price, with the actual price to be determined at a specified timeframe before shipment of the respective batch of miners. In addition, each batch of miners constitutes independent legal obligations, and TeraWulf will have limited legal recourse in the event of delays to the delivery date. Furthermore, the Bitmain agreements are solely governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Hong Kong. In the event that geopolitical turmoil, political instability, civil disturbances and restrictive government actions cause changes to the laws of

Table of Contents 
 Hong Kong, TeraWulf could face difficulties enforcing rights and obligations between the parties in the Bitmain agreements. The MinerVA agreement is governed by the laws of the Province of Alberta, Canada without regard to any conflict of law provisions that might otherwise apply. Such contractual provisions leave TeraWulf with limited avenues for legal recourse in the event of disputes between the parties. If TeraWulf is unable to successfully maintain such agreements or TeraWulf s counterparties fail to perform their obligations under the final agreements, TeraWulf may be forced to look for alternative power providers. There is no assurance that TeraWulf will be able to find alternative suppliers on acceptable terms in a timely manner, or at all. Any significant nonperformance by suppliers could have a material adverse effect on TeraWulf s business prospects, financial condition and operating results. Since the development, construction and operation of the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility is subject to the terms of a joint venture agreement, TeraWulf may have less control over strategic decisions. On August 27, 2022, TeraWulf entered into an amended and restated joint venture agreement with an affiliate of Talen, as amended. The joint venture agreement provides that, except for certain specified matters, decisions are to be made by a majority vote of the board of managers. The board of managers is comprised of one manager appointed by TeraWulf and four managers appointed by Talen. Any significant disagreements between joint venture partners on strategic decisions or the inability of the Talen affiliate to meet obligations to the joint venture or third parties may impede TeraWulf s ability to control aspects of the development, construction, and operation of the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility. The digital asset exchanges on which cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, trade are relatively new and largely unregulated, and thus may be exposed to fraud and failure. Such failures may result in a reduction in the price of bitcoin, or even cause the market for bitcoin to disappear entirely, which would adversely affect an investment in us. Digital asset exchanges on which cryptocurrencies trade are relatively new and, in most cases, largely unregulated although regulatory scrutiny of digital asset exchanges is increasing. Many digital exchanges currently do not provide the public with significant information regarding their ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices or regulatory compliance. As a result, the marketplace may lose confidence in, or may experience problems relating to, cryptocurrency exchanges, which may cause the price of bitcoin to decline. For example, in the first half of 2022, each of Celsius, Voyager and Three Arrows declared bankruptcy, resulting in a loss of confidence in participants of the digital asset ecosystem and negative publicity surrounding digital assets more broadly. In November 2022, FTX, the third largest digital asset exchange by volume at the time, halted customer withdrawals and shortly thereafter, FTX and its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy. Most recently, in January 2023, Genesis filed for bankruptcy. Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group Inc. DCG ), who also owns Foundry, our mining pool provider; however, at this time, the Company is not subject to any material risks arising from its indirect exposure to Genesis. Additionally, in March 2023, Silicon Valley Bank, SBNY and Silvergate Bank, which all counted crypto market participants among their clientele, ceased operations in March 2023. In response to these events, the digital asset markets, including the market for bitcoin specifically, have experienced extreme price volatility and several other entities in the digital asset industry have been, and may continue to be, negatively affected, further undermining confidence in the digital assets markets and in bitcoin. These events have also negatively impacted the liquidity of the digital assets markets as certain entities affiliated with FTX engaged in significant trading activity. If the liquidity of the digital assets markets continues to be negatively impacted by these events, digital asset prices, including the price of bitcoin, may continue to experience significant volatility and confidence in the digital asset markets may be further undermined. A perceived lack of stability in the digital asset exchange market and the closure or temporary shutdown of digital asset exchanges or banks catering to crypto market participants due to business failure, hackers or malware, government-mandated regulation, or fraud, may reduce confidence in digital asset networks and result in greater volatility in bitcoin s value. Because the value of bitcoin is derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange government-issued currency that is designated as legal tender in its country of issuance through government decree, regulation, or law fiat currency) for bitcoin, permanent and total loss of the value of bitcoin may result should the marketplace for bitcoin be jeopardized or disappear entirely. We are continuing to monitor and evaluate our risk management procedures, but we believe our current risk management procedures are reasonably designed and effective. We do not participate in any digital asset exchanges; we do not hold, sell or redeem any cryptocurrency on anyone else s behalf; we hold our proprietary bitcoin, and any bitcoin earned from hosting arrangements, in a cold storage wallet with our digital asset custodian, NYDIG, a duly chartered New York limited liability trust company, to act as a custodian for our mined bitcoin; we do not hedge our bitcoin; and we sell our bitcoin using NYDIG Execution, a Delaware LLC registered as a Money Services Business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and licensed with a BitLicense by the New York State Department of Financial Services. We do not sell or intend to sell our own bitcoin using any type of exchange, but rather 
 21 

Table of Contents 
 rely on NYDIG Execution to sell our mined bitcoin on our behalf. Even still, the perceived lack of stability in digital asset exchanges and potential decline in the value of bitcoin could adversely affect an investment in us. Furthermore, any permanent, non-temporary decrease in the price of bitcoin would cause a risk of increased losses or impairments in our investments or other assets. TeraWulf may need to raise additional capital to meet its business requirements in the future, which capital raising may be costly or difficult to obtain or may not be obtained (in whole or in part) and, if obtained, could significantly dilute the ownership interests of TeraWulf s shareholders. TeraWulf had a working capital deficiency of 111.9 million as of December 31, 2022. TeraWulf will require additional capital in the future to support its operations and may seek to raise additional financing in the future. TeraWulf may not be able to borrow or raise additional capital to meet its current liquidity needs or to otherwise provide the capital necessary to expand its operations and business, whether due to negative investor sentiment from the recent closures of Silicon Valley Bank, SBNY and Silvergate Bank and/or Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings of various cryptocurrency market participants, including Genesis, FTX, BlockFi, Celsius, Voyager and Three Arrows, or adverse geopolitical or economic conditions, which might result in the value of our Common Stock decreasing or becoming worthless. If TeraWulf is unable to raise sufficient financing to meet its liquidity needs, then we may not be able to continue our current operations. TeraWulf does not rely on third-party exchanges; mines only bitcoin (and no other cryptocurrency) solely for its own account (without customers or counterparties); hosts certain third parties miners at its Lake Mariner datacenter, but does not have any access to or control over third parties mined revenue; and, significantly, does not hold crypto assets on behalf of third parties or any customers and has no direct exposure (whether through deposits or otherwise) to any cryptocurrency market participants that recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy or are known to have experienced excessive redemptions, suspended redemptions or have crypto assets of their customers unaccounted for. Additionally, our business in the commercial optimization of power is unaffected by the recent crypto industry market events. However, negative investor sentiment regarding the cryptocurrency industry at large may make it difficult for TeraWulf to obtain additional financing on terms that are acceptable, which could affect TeraWulf s liquidity. Obtaining additional financing involves risks, including, among others: additional equity or debt financing may not be available to TeraWulf on satisfactory terms and any equity TeraWulf is able to issue will lead to dilution of the ownership interests of TeraWulf s shareholders; loans or other debt instruments may have terms and/or conditions, such as restrictive covenants, which may limit TeraWulf s future financing activities; and heightened scrutiny of companies involved with cryptocurrencies in the current regulatory environment, especially as a result of the recent closures of Silicon Valley Bank, SBNY and Silvergate Bank and/or Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings of Genesis, FTX, BlockFi, Celsius, Voyager and Three Arrows, combined with TeraWulf s capital constraints, may prevent TeraWulf from being able to obtain adequate financing. 
 Our liquidity has been substantially dependent on our financing efforts and our business could be materially adversely affected by limited liquidity in the future. We began bitcoin mining in March 2022 and to date, we have not achieved positive net earnings. We have primarily relied upon draws under our Loan, Guaranty and Security Agreement dated as of December 1, 2021, among Wilmington Trust, National Association, a national banking association, in its capacity as administrative agent and collateral agent, the lenders party thereto, the guarantors party thereto and the Company (as amended from time to time, the LGSA ), as well as additional equity and debt financings, in addition to operating cash flow, to fund our operations. Our bitcoin mining business is in its early stages, and bitcoin and energy pricing and bitcoin mining economics are volatile and subject to uncertainty. Our business is subject to the numerous risks and volatility associated with the cryptocurrency industry, including the fallout from the Chapter 11 bankruptcies of Genesis, FTX, Voyager, Celsius and BlockFi, declines in the value of or fluctuating bitcoin to U.S. Dollar prices, the costs of bitcoin miners, supply chain constraints and other factors that cause delays in miner deliveries, the number of market participants mining bitcoin, interruptions in our power supply, and regulatory changes. As disclosed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment pursuant to which it achieved amortization relief for its term loans until at least April 2024 with the possibility of extending amortization relief until the maturity date of the term loans. If the Company is unable to successfully extend amortization relief through the maturity date, its liquidity may be materially adversely affected.

 Although the Company has taken actions, such as the Equity Offering and the various other transactions disclosed herein, to increase its liquidity, the issues described above and other developments that may negatively affect the Company s liquidity, such as high inflation and a potential recession, may continue or recur in the future. Actions previously taken by the Company to address these issues, such as cost cutting, may have a negative effect on the future business and results of operations of the Company. There can be no assurance that these developments will not impair the Company s liquidity in the future. If the Company is unable to finance its business on either a short-term or long-term basis due to a decrease in borrowing capacity under the LGSA, an inability to satisfy the terms of the LGSA or a lack of liquidity (whether as a result of an inability to draw under the LGSA or otherwise), it could result in a material adverse effect on the Company s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which may, if not effectively remediated, result in additional material misstatements in our financial statements. TeraWulf s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As disclosed in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. The related control deficiencies resulted in material misstatements in our previously issued interim financial statements for interim periods within the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. The misstatements relate solely to incorrectly calculating the impact of noncash activity on purchase and deposits on plant and equipment, resulting in an understatement of net cash used in investing activities and a corresponding overstatement of net cash used in operating activities as originally included in the respective unaudited consolidated statements of cash flows. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of the material weakness, TeraWulf s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting and related disclosure controls and procedures were not effective based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. TeraWulf s management is actively engaged in developing a remediation plan designed to address this material weakness. If TeraWulf s remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in its internal control are discovered or occur in the future, its financial statements may contain material misstatements and TeraWulf could be required to restate its financial results. Although our digital assets are only stored using cold storage, we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to our digital asset custodian, NYDIG Trust Company LLC. We use NYDIG Trust Company, LLC NYDIG ), a duly chartered New York limited liability trust company, to act as a custodian for our mined bitcoin. NYDIG receives and holds our custodied assets, which includes both our digital assets and any cash we may choose to custody with NYDIG. Our digital assets custodied with NYDIG are not deposits within the meaning of U.S. federal or state banking law, and thus balances of digital assets held in our custodian account are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC or Securities Investor Protection Corporation SIPC protections. Additionally, instructions to NYDIG to withdraw our digital assets are sent, and digital assets are received by us from NYDIG, using digital asset networks, and the software and cryptography that governs the protocols of digital asset networks have short histories and could at any time be found ineffective or faulty, which could result in the complete loss of value or theft of our digital assets custodied with NYDIG. Additionally, the nature of digital assets means that any technological difficulties experienced by NYDIG may prevent us from accessing or using our bitcoin custodied with NYDIG. Only NYDIG holds the private keys to our wallet, and no one at the Company has access to our wallet s private keys; any loss of our private keys relating to, or hack or other compromise of, our digital wallet would adversely affect our ability to access or sell our bitcoin. No physical, operational and cryptographic system for the secure storage of private keys is perfectly secure, and loss or theft due to operational or other failure of NYDIG s operations is always possible. However, pursuant to our Digital Asset Custodial Agreement, dated as of March 10, 2022, between us and NYDIG (as may be amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the Custody Agreement ), NYDIG has covenanted that it holds our digital assets in a segregated account that will at all times be identifiable in NYDIG s database as being stored for our benefit; that NYDIG has no right, interest or title in our digital assets; and that our digital assets do not constitute an asset on the balance sheet of NYDIG. To the extent NYDIG holds any cash on our behalf, NYDIG may hold our cash in one or more omnibus for benefit of customers accounts at one or more U.S. insured depository institutions; however, at this time, the Company has no cash custodied, and has no immediate or 
 23 

Table of Contents 
 future plans to custody, any cash with NYDIG. Furthermore, NYDIG has covenanted that our digital assets will not be commingled with other digital assets held by NYDIG, except temporarily (typically for no longer than 12 hours, but in no case longer than 72 hours) as an operational matter, if required, to effect a transfer into or out of our digital asset account. Significantly, NYDIG represents and warrants that beneficial and legal ownership of all our digital assets is, and will remain, freely transferable without the payment of money or value and that NYDIG has no ownership interest in our account. While we believe that the Custody Agreement provides our business with reasonable protections for our business s operations and the safe storage of our digital assets, we make no assurances that storing our digital assets with NYDIG is free from risk, given the various risks enumerated above. To the best of our knowledge, NYDIG safely stores our digital assets in segregated accounts as represented in the Custody Agreement, however, if NYDIG were to be in breach of the Custody Agreement, our digital assets could be compromised. Additionally, if NYDIG were to cease operations, declare insolvency or file for bankruptcy, there is a reasonable risk that recovery of our assets, though kept in segregated accounts, would be delayed or unrecoverable. Additionally, if NYDIG were to cease operations, declare insolvency or file for bankruptcy, we do not have a readily available backup custodian at this time, and so we would need to self-custody our digital assets using cold storage until we could contract with another adequate custodian for the safe storage of our assets which may have a disruptive effect on our business. In the meantime, our mined bitcoin would continue to aggregate in our proprietary wallet until we found a suitable cold storage custodian. We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to our mining pool operator, Foundry Digital LLC. We participate in a mining pool operated by Foundry, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware. As a mining pool participant, we rely on Foundry s open access mining pool to receive our daily mining rewards and fees from the bitcoin network; our miners point or send their hashpower continually throughout the day to Foundry s pool s address, which acts as a blockchain miner node on the bitcoin network. At the end of each day, our share of the bitcoin earned by each of our miners is collectively sent from Foundry to our wallet address custodied with NYDIG. Mining pools like Foundry s allow miners like ours to combine their computing and processing power, increasing our chances of solving a block and getting rewarded by the bitcoin network. Foundry uses the Full Pay Per Share payout model, which means that in exchange for providing computing power to the pool, TeraWulf is entitled to compensation, calculated on a daily basis, at an amount that approximates the total bitcoin that could have been mined using TeraWulf s computer power, based upon the then-current blockchain difficulty. Under this model, we are entitled to compensation regardless of whether Foundry successfully records a block to the bitcoin blockchain. Should Foundry s operator systems suffer downtime due to a cyber-attack, software malfunction or other similar issues, it will negatively impact our ability to mine and receive revenue. We own all of our miners and accompanying electrical infrastructure, and the only connection between our assets and Foundry is that our miners hashpower is currently pointed to send all of their hash to Foundry s address. However, if Foundry were to suffer downtime or cease to exist altogether, the immediate impact to us would be that we would not have a mining pool for our miners to send their daily hashpower to, so the miners would not be able to earn any revenue until we pointed our miners to a new pool provider or became a miner node (as Foundry is) on the bitcoin network. We currently do not have a back-up pool provider, so were Foundry to cease operations, there would be some delay and consequently lost revenue until we retained a new pool provider and pointed our miners at the new pool provider, which we would do by using a mass command issued by our management software. Furthermore, while we receive daily reports from Foundry detailing the total processing power provided to its mining pool and our proportion of that total processing power to determine the distribution of rewards to us, we are dependent on the accuracy of Foundry s record keeping. We have little means of recourse against Foundry if we determine the proportion of the reward paid out to us by Foundry is incorrect, other than leaving Foundry s pool altogether. If we are unable to consistently obtain accurate proportionate rewards from our pools, we may experience reduced rewards for our efforts, which would have an adverse effect on our business and operations. Additionally, were Foundry to cease operations, declare insolvency or file for bankruptcy, there is a reasonable risk that recovery of any mining rewards or fees for any given day that had not yet been delivered into our wallet held at NYDIG would be delayed or unrecoverable. If the value of bitcoin declines precipitously, the value of our collateral under our Loan, Guaranty and Security Agreement with Wilmington Trust, National Association as administrative agent may also decline, and we would face increased losses or impairments in our investments and other assets. Our mined bitcoin, together with all of our Company s other assets, serves as collateral for our lenders under our LGSA. If the price of bitcoin were to decline precipitously, the value of our collateral package under the LGSA will also decline. While we are still able to draw on our LGSA even if the value of the collateral declines, our ability to raise more financing from our existing lenders or new lenders may be impaired by the current crypto asset market disruption. We would also face a risk of increased losses or impairments in our investments and other assets if the price of bitcoin were to permanently decline.

 To protect our bitcoin that is part of our collateral under our loan, we have entered into a Deposit Account Control Agreement, dated as of March 11, 2022, by and among the Company, NYDIG and Wilmington Trust, National Association (on behalf of the lenders under the LGSA) (the DACA ). Pursuant to the DACA, we deposit our bitcoin with NYDIG in a segregated account, subject to the security interest of Wilmington Trust, National Association, as a secured party. We have also entered into a Digital Asset Execution Agreement between us and NYDIG Execution, a Delaware LLC registered as a Money Services Business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and licensed with a BitLicense by the New York State Department of Financial Services, dated as of September 16, 2022 (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the Execution Agreement ). Pursuant to the Execution Agreement, so long as the DACA is in effect, we are the lawful owner of all digital assets we send to NYDIG Execution in connection with a transaction (including through transfers from NYDIG and/or NYDIG Execution under the DACA). The Execution Agreement further provides that title and ownership to any such digital assets passes to the purchaser of such digital assets free and clear of liens, claims, charges, encumbrances and transfer restrictions, assuming that cash owing to us from any such transaction is settled directly into a deposit account in our name at a third-party U.S. depository institution. All funds from the sale of bitcoin by NYDIG Execution are currently deposited by NYDIG Execution directly in a third-party U.S. depository institution. Despite these assurances in the Execution Agreement, if NYDIG were to be in breach of the Execution Agreement, our bitcoin and collateral package under our loan with our lenders would be at risk. See also Although our digital assets are only stored using cold storage, we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to our digital asset custodian, NYDIG Trust Company LLC. Security threats or unauthorized or impermissible access to our datacenters, our operations or our digital wallet from U.S. or non-U.S. actors could result in a loss of our bitcoin and assets or cause damage to our reputation, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Security breaches, computer malware, software supply chain attacks and computer hacking attacks have been a prevalent concern in the digital asset exchange markets. Any security breach caused by hacking, which could be by U.S. or non-U.S. actors, and involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, cause intentional malfunctions or loss, encryption or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and transmit computer viruses or ransomware could harm our business operations or result in the loss of our digital assets. Furthermore, we believe that, as our business grows, we could become a more appealing target for cybersecurity threats. As discussed elsewhere herein, we rely on cold storage custody solutions from NYDIG to safeguard our bitcoin from theft, loss, destruction or other issues relating to hackers and technological attack. Nevertheless, cold storage security systems may not be impenetrable and may not be free from defect or immune to acts of God, and any loss due to a security breach, software defect or act of God will be borne by TeraWulf. Additionally, our security systems, physical datacenters and operational infrastructure could be breached by outside parties, software defects, action of an employee of TeraWulf, or otherwise and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to TeraWulf s private keys, sensitive data control, operation of miners and our bitcoin. In addition, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees of TeraWulf to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our infrastructure. As the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, or may be designed to remain dormant until a predetermined event and often are not recognized until launched against a target, TeraWulf may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security system occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of TeraWulf s security system could be harmed, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, in the event of a security breach, TeraWulf may be forced to cease operations or suffer a reduction in digital assets, which could adversely affect TeraWulf s business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to Digital Asset Networks and Digital Assets Digital assets, such as bitcoin, may become regulated as securities or investment securities. Bitcoin is the oldest and most well-known form of digital asset. Bitcoin and other forms of digital assets / cryptocurrencies have been the source of much regulatory scrutiny, which has resulted in differing definitional outcomes without a single unifying statement. In the context of the offer and sale of the Initial Coin Offering ICO tokens, the SEC has determined certain digital tokens are securities under the Howey test as stated by the U.S. Supreme Court. ICO offerings of securities would require registration under the Securities Act or an available exemption therefrom for offers or sales in the United States to be lawful. Section 5(a) of the Securities Act provides that, unless a registration statement is in effect as to a security, it is unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to engage in the offer or sale of securities in interstate commerce. Furthermore, Section 5(c) of the Securities Act provides a similar prohibition against offers to sell, or offers to buy, unless a registration statement has been filed. Although the Company does not believe its mining activities require registration for it to conduct such activities and accumulate digital assets, the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC ), Nasdaq or other governmental or quasi- governmental agency or 
 25 

Table of Contents 
 organization may conclude that the Company s activities involve the offer or sale of securities, or ownership of investment securities, and the Company may face regulation under the Securities Act or the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). Such regulation or the inability to meet the requirements to continue operations would have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. The further development and acceptance of digital asset networks and other digital assets, which represent a new and rapidly changing industry, are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate, and the slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of digital asset systems may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. Digital assets such as bitcoins, which may be used, among other things, to buy and sell goods and services are a new and rapidly evolving industry of which the digital asset networks are prominent, but not unique, parts. The growth of the digital asset industry in general, and the digital asset networks of bitcoin in particular, are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The factors affecting the further development of the digital asset industry, as well as the digital asset networks, include, among others: continued worldwide growth in the adoption and use of bitcoins and other digital assets; government and quasi-government regulation of bitcoins and other digital assets and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of the digital asset network or similar digital assets systems; the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of the bitcoin network; changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences; the availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, including new means of using fiat currencies; general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to digital assets; and the impact of regulators focusing on digital assets and digital securities and the costs associated with such regulatory oversight. 
 A decline in the popularity or acceptance of the digital asset networks of bitcoin, or similar digital asset systems, could adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. If demand for transactions in bitcoin declines and is replaced by new demand for other cryptocurrencies, the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. TeraWulf s business is highly dependent on strong bitcoin demand relative to other cryptocurrencies in the market. As such, in addition to the factors impacting the broader crypto economy described elsewhere in this section, the Company s business may be adversely affected, and growth in TeraWulf s, and therefore the Company s, revenues may slow or decline, if market demand for bitcoin deteriorates and is supplanted by other cryptocurrencies such as ethereum and dogecoin. In addition, negative perceptions surrounding bitcoin relative to other cryptocurrencies may cause bitcoin to fall out of favor. If other cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum and dogecoin, surpass bitcoin in market demand over a sustained period of time, such a trend could harm the Company s business. Competition from public and central bank backed digital currencies could undercut the need for other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Competition from stablecoins (commodity-backed or fiat-backed) could undercut demand for other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Significant contributors to all or any digital asset network could propose amendments to the respective network s protocols and software that, if accepted and authorized by such network, could adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. Digital asset networks are open-source projects and, although there is an influential group of leaders in, for example, the bitcoin network community known as the Core Developers, there is no official developer or group of developers that formally controls the bitcoin network. Any individual can download the bitcoin network software and make any desired modifications, which are proposed to users and miners on the bitcoin network through software downloads and upgrades, typically posted to the bitcoin development forum on GitHub.com. Proposals for upgrades and discussions relating thereto take place on online forums. For example, 
 26 

Table of Contents 
 there is an ongoing debate regarding altering the blockchain by increasing the size of blocks to accommodate a larger volume of transactions. Although some proponents support an increase, other market participants oppose an increase to the block size as it may deter miners from confirming transactions and concentrate power into a smaller group of miners. To the extent that a significant majority of the users and miners on the bitcoin network install such software upgrade, the bitcoin network would be subject to new protocols and software that may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event a developer or group of developers proposes a modification to the bitcoin network that is not accepted by a majority of miners and users, but that is nonetheless accepted by a substantial plurality of miners and users, two or more competing and incompatible blockchain implementations could result. This is known as a hard fork. We may not be able to realize the economic benefit of such a hard fork , either immediately or ever, which could adversely affect an investment in our securities. If we hold a cryptocurrency at the time of a hard fork, industry standards would dictate that we would be expected to hold an equivalent amount of the old and new assets following the fork. However, we may not be able, or it may not be practical, to secure or realize the economic benefit of the new asset for various reasons. For instance, we may determine that there is no safe or practical way to custody the new asset, that trying to do so may pose an unacceptable risk to our holdings in the old asset, or that the costs of taking possession and/or maintaining ownership of the new cryptocurrency exceed the benefits of owning the new cryptocurrency. Additionally, laws, regulation or other factors may prevent us from benefitting from the new asset even if there is a safe and practical way to custody and secure the new asset. In such case, the hard fork in the blockchain could materially and adversely affect the perceived value of digital assets as reflected on one or both incompatible blockchains, which may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations and, in the worst-case scenario, harm the sustainability of the bitcoin network s economy. The open-source structure of the bitcoin network protocol means that the contributors to the protocol are generally not directly compensated for their contributions in maintaining and developing the bitcoin network protocol, and a failure to properly monitor and upgrade the protocol could damage the bitcoin network and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. The bitcoin network operates based on an open-source protocol, not represented by an official organization or authority. Instead, it is maintained by a group of core contributors, largely on the Bitcoin Core project on GitHub. As an open-source project, bitcoin is not represented by an official organization or authority. As the bitcoin network protocol is not sold and its use does not generate revenues for contributors, contributors are generally not directly compensated for maintaining and developing the bitcoin network protocol. Although the Media Lab s Digital Currency Initiative of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology funds the current maintainer Wladimir J. van der Laan, among others, this type of financial incentive is not typical. The lack of guaranteed financial incentive for contributors to maintain or develop the bitcoin network and the lack of guaranteed resources to adequately address emerging issues with the bitcoin network may reduce incentives to address the issues adequately or in a timely manner. Changes to a digital asset network which the Company is mining on may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. If a malicious actor or botnet obtains control in excess of 50 of the processing power active on any digital asset network, including the bitcoin network, it is possible that such actor or botnet could manipulate the blockchain in a manner that may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. If a malicious actor or botnet (a volunteer or hacked collection of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions of the computers) obtains a majority of the processing power dedicated to mining on any digital asset network, including the bitcoin network, it may be able to alter the blockchain by constructing alternate blocks if it is able to solve for such blocks faster than the remainder of the miners on the blockchain can add valid blocks. In such alternate blocks, the malicious actor or botnet could control, exclude or modify the ordering of transactions, though it could not generate new digital assets or transactions using such control. Using alternate blocks, the malicious actor could double-spend its own digital assets i.e. , spend the same digital assets in more than one transaction) and prevent the confirmation of other users transactions for so long as it maintains control. To the extent that such malicious actor or botnet does not yield its majority control of the processing power or the digital asset community does not reject the fraudulent blocks as malicious, reversing any changes made to the blockchain may not be possible, which may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. The approach towards and possible crossing of the 50 threshold indicates a greater risk that a single mining pool could exert authority over the validation of digital asset transactions. To the extent that the digital assets ecosystems do not act to ensure greater decentralization of digital asset mining processing power, the feasibility of a malicious actor obtaining in excess of 50 of the

 processing power on any digital asset network e.g. , through control of a large mining pool or through hacking such a mining pool) will increase, which may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. If the award of digital assets for solving blocks and transaction fees for recording transactions are not sufficiently high to cover expenses related to running data center operations, it may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. Bitcoin miners record transactions when they solve for and add blocks of information to the blockchain. When a miner solves for a block, it creates such block, which includes data relating to (i) the solution to the block, (ii) a reference to the prior block in the blockchain to which the new block is being added and (iii) all transactions that have occurred but have not yet been added to the blockchain. The miner becomes aware of outstanding, unrecorded transactions through data packet transmission and propagation. Typically, bitcoin transactions will be recorded in the next chronological block if the spending party has an internet connection and at least one minute has passed between the transaction s data packet transmission and the solution of the next block. If a transaction is not recorded in the next chronological block, it is usually recorded in the next block thereafter. As the award of new digital assets for solving blocks declines, and if transaction fees are not sufficiently high, miners may not have an adequate incentive to continue mining and may cease their mining operations. For example, the current fixed reward on the bitcoin network for solving a new block is six and a quarter (6.25) bitcoins per block. The reward decreased from twelve and a half (12.5) bitcoins in May 2020. It is estimated that it will halve again in approximately May 2024. This reduction may result in a reduction in the aggregate hashrate of the bitcoin network as the incentive for miners will decrease. Moreover, miners ceasing operations would reduce the aggregate hashrate on the bitcoin network, which would adversely affect the confirmation process for transactions i.e. , temporarily decreasing the speed at which blocks are added to the blockchain until the next scheduled adjustment in difficulty for block solutions) and make the bitcoin network more vulnerable to a malicious actor obtaining control in excess of 50 of the aggregate hashrate on the bitcoin network. Periodically, the bitcoin network has adjusted the difficulty for block solutions so that solution speeds remain in the vicinity of the expected ten-minute confirmation time targeted by the bitcoin network protocol. The Company believes that from time to time there will be further considerations and adjustments to the bitcoin network and others regarding the difficulty for block solutions. More significant reductions in aggregate hashrate on digital asset networks could result in material, though temporary, delays in block solution confirmation time. Any reduction in confidence in the confirmation process or aggregate hashrate of any digital asset network may negatively impact the value of digital assets, which may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that the profit margins of digital asset mining operations are not high, operators of digital asset mining operations are more likely to immediately sell their digital assets earned by mining in the digital asset exchange market, resulting in a reduction in the price of digital assets that may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. Over the past ten years, digital asset mining operations have evolved from individual users mining with computer processors, graphics processing units and first-generation servers. Currently, new processing power brought onto the digital asset networks is predominantly added by incorporated and unincorporated professionalized mining operations. Professionalized mining operations may use proprietary hardware or sophisticated machines. They require the investment of significant capital for the acquisition of this hardware, the leasing of operating space (often in data centers or warehousing facilities), incurrence of electricity costs and the employment of technicians to operate the mining farms. As a result, professionalized mining operations are of a greater scale than prior miners and have more defined, regular expenses and liabilities. These regular expenses and liabilities require professionalized mining operations to more immediately sell digital assets earned from mining operations on the digital asset exchange market, whereas it is believed that individual miners in past years were more likely to hold newly mined digital assets for more extended periods. The immediate selling of newly mined digital assets greatly increases the supply of digital assets on the digital asset exchange market, creating downward pressure on the price of each digital asset. The extent to which the value of digital assets mined by a professionalized mining operation exceeds the allocable capital and operating costs determines the profit margin of such operation. A professionalized mining operation may be more likely to sell a higher percentage of its newly mined digital assets rapidly if it is operating at a low profit margin and it may partially or completely cease operations if its profit margin is negative. This could create a network effect that may further reduce the price of digital assets until mining operations with higher operating costs become unprofitable and remove mining power from the respective digital asset network. The network effect of reduced profit margins resulting in greater sales of newly mined digital assets could result in a reduction in the price of digital assets that may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.

 To the extent that any miners cease to record transactions in solved blocks, transactions that do not include the payment of a transaction fee will not be recorded on the blockchain until a block is solved by a miner who does not require the payment of transaction fees, and any widespread delays in the recording of transactions could result in a loss of confidence in that digital asset network, which may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that any miners cease to record transactions in solved blocks, such transactions will not be recorded on the blockchain. Currently, there are no known incentives for miners to elect to exclude the recording of transactions in solved blocks. However, to the extent that any such incentives arise e.g. , a collective movement among miners or one or more mining pools forcing bitcoin users to pay transaction fees as a substitute for or in addition to the award of new bitcoins upon the solving of a block), actions of miners solving a significant number of blocks could delay the recording and confirmation of transactions on the blockchain. Any systemic delays in the recording and confirmation of transactions on the blockchain could result in greater exposure to double-spending transactions, or transactions that consist of bad actors simultaneously sending two or more bitcoin to different addresses, and a loss of confidence in certain or all digital asset networks, which may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. Intellectual property rights claims may adversely affect the operation of some or all digital asset networks. Third parties may assert intellectual property claims relating to the holding and transfer of digital assets and their source code. Regardless of the merit of any intellectual property or other legal action, any threatened action that reduces confidence in some or all digital asset networks long-term viability or the ability of end-users to hold and transfer digital assets may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a meritorious intellectual property claim could prevent the Company and other end-users from accessing some or all digital asset networks or holding or transferring their digital assets. As a result, an intellectual property claim against the Company or other large digital asset network participants may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that the digital asset exchanges representing a substantial portion of the volume in digital asset trading are involved in fraud or experience security failures or other operational issues, such digital asset exchanges failures may result in a reduction in the price of some or all digital assets and may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. The digital asset exchanges on which the digital assets trade are new and, in most cases, largely unregulated. Furthermore, many digital asset exchanges (including several of the most prominent U.S. dollar denominated digital asset exchanges) do not provide the public with significant information regarding their ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices or regulatory compliance. As a result, the marketplace may lose confidence in, or may experience problems relating to, digital asset exchanges, including prominent exchanges handling a significant portion of the volume of digital asset trading. A lack of stability in the digital asset exchange market and the closure or temporary shutdown of digital asset exchanges due to fraud, business failure, hackers or malware or government-mandated regulation may reduce confidence in the digital asset networks and result in greater volatility in digital asset values. These potential consequences of a digital asset exchange s failure may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. Political or economic crises may motivate large-scale sales of digital assets, which could result in a reduction in some or all digital assets values and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. As an alternative to fiat currencies that are backed by central governments, digital assets such as bitcoins, which are relatively new, are subject to supply and demand forces based upon the desirability of an alternative, decentralized means of buying and selling goods and services, and it is unclear how such supply and demand will be impacted by geopolitical events. Nevertheless, political or economic crises, including current or anticipated military conflicts such as the war between Russia and Ukraine, terrorism, sanctions or other geopolitical events globally, may motivate large-scale acquisitions or sales of digital assets either globally or locally. Large-scale sales of digital assets would result in a reduction in some or all digital assets values and may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.

 The Company s ability to adopt technology in response to changing security needs or trends poses a challenge to the safekeeping of the Company s digital assets. The history of digital asset exchanges has shown that exchanges and large holders of digital assets must adapt to technological change in order to secure and safeguard their digital assets. The Company will rely on enterprise cold storage solutions from third parties to safeguard the Company s digital assets from theft, loss, destruction or other issues relating to hackers and technological attack. The Company s digital assets may also be moved to various exchanges in order to exchange them for fiat currency during which time the Company will be relying on the security of such exchanges to safeguard the Company s digital assets. The Company believes that it may become a more appealing target of security threats as the size of the Company s bitcoin holdings grow. To the extent that either custody providers or the Company are unable to identify and mitigate or stop new security threats, the Company s digital assets may be subject to theft, loss, destruction or other attack, which may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. Digital asset transactions are irrevocable, and stolen or incorrectly transferred digital assets may be irretrievable and, as a result, any incorrectly executed digital asset transactions may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. Digital asset transactions are not, from an administrative perspective, reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the transaction or, in theory, control or consent of a majority of the processing power on the respective digital asset network. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the blockchain, an incorrect transfer of digital assets or a theft of digital assets generally will not be reversible, and the Company may not be capable of seeking compensation for any such transfer or theft. Although the Company s transfers of digital assets will regularly be made to or from various parties, it is possible that, through computer or human error, or through theft or criminal action, the Company s digital assets could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties. To the extent that the Company is unable to seek a corrective transaction with such third party or is incapable of identifying the third party which has received the Company s digital assets through error or theft, the Company will be unable to revert or otherwise recover incorrectly transferred digital assets. To the extent that the Company is unable to seek redress for such error or theft, such loss may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. The limited rights of legal recourse against the Company, and the Company s lack of insurance protection, expose the Company and its stockholders to the risk of loss of its digital assets for which no person is liable. The digital assets held by the Company may not be insured. Therefore, a loss may be suffered with respect to the Company s digital assets which is not covered by insurance and for which no person is liable in damages, which may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company may not have adequate sources of recovery if its digital assets are lost, stolen or destroyed. If the Company s digital assets are lost, stolen or destroyed under circumstances rendering a party liable to the Company, the responsible party may not have the financial resources sufficient to satisfy its claim. For example, as to a particular event of loss, the only source of recovery for the Company might be limited, to the extent identifiable, other responsible third parties e.g. , a thief or terrorist), any of which may not have the financial resources (including liability insurance coverage) to satisfy a valid claim by the Company. Digital assets held by the Company are not subject to FDIC or SIPC protections. The Company does not hold its digital assets with a banking institution or a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation SIPC and, therefore, its digital assets are not subject to the protections enjoyed by depositors with FDIC or SIPC member institutions.

 The loss or destruction of a private key required to access a digital asset may be irreversible and, as a result, the Company s loss of access to its private keys or its experience of a data loss relating to its digital assets may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. Digital assets are controllable only by the possessor of both the unique public key and private key relating to the local or online digital wallet in which the digital assets are held. The Company is required by the operation of digital asset networks to publish the public key relating to a digital wallet in use when it first verifies a spending transaction from that digital wallet and disseminates such information into the respective network. The Company safeguards and keeps private the private keys relating to its digital assets by using enterprise cold storage custody solutions from third parties. To the extent a private key is lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised and no backup of the private key is accessible, the Company will be unable to access the digital assets held by it and the private key will not be capable of being restored by the respective digital asset network. Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to store the Company s digital assets may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. Because many of the Company s digital assets are held by digital asset exchanges, it faces heightened risks from cybersecurity attacks and financial stability of digital asset exchanges. The Company may transfer digital assets from its wallet to digital asset exchanges prior to selling them. Digital assets not held in the Company s wallet are subject to the risks encountered by digital asset exchanges including a denial-of-service attack or other malicious hacking, a sale of the digital asset exchange, loss of the digital assets by the digital asset exchange and other risks similar to those described herein. The Company may not maintain a custodian agreement with any of the digital asset exchanges that hold the Company s digital assets. These digital asset exchanges may or may not provide insurance and may lack the resources to protect against hacking and theft. If this were to occur, the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. As the number of digital assets awarded for solving a block in the blockchain decreases, the incentive for miners to continue to contribute processing power to the respective digital asset network will transition from a set reward to transaction fees. In order to incentivize miners to continue to contribute processing power to any digital asset network, such network may either formally or informally transition from a set reward to transaction fees earned upon solving for a block. This transition could be accomplished either by miners independently electing to record in the blocks they solve only those transactions that include payment of a transaction fee or by the digital asset network adopting software upgrades that require the payment of a minimum transaction fee for all transactions. If transaction fees paid for digital asset transactions become too high, the marketplace may be reluctant to accept digital assets as a means of payment and existing users may be motivated to switch from one digital asset to another digital asset or back to fiat currency. Decreased use and demand for bitcoins may adversely affect the value of the Company s bitcoins and may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. The price of bitcoin may be influenced by regulatory, commercial and technical factors that are highly uncertain resulting in the price of bitcoin being extremely volatile, which may significantly influence the market price of the Company s common stock. To the extent investors view the value of the Company s common stock as linked to the value or change in the value of bitcoin, fluctuations in the price of bitcoin may significantly influence the market price of the Company s common stock. In addition, the Company s business operations are no longer economical below the bitcoin breakeven point, or the point at which the total cost of mining operations exceeds the total revenues generated. The price of bitcoin has historically been subject to dramatic fluctuations and is highly volatile. Bitcoin has only recently become accepted as a means of payment for goods and services and has recently trended toward becoming a more actively traded instrument, however the acceptance and use of bitcoin remains limited and far from mainstream. Conversely, a significant portion of demand for bitcoin may be generated by speculators and investors seeking to profit from the short- or long-term holding of bitcoin. In addition, some blockchain industry participants have reported that a significant percentage of bitcoin trading activity is artificial or non-economic in nature and may represent attempts to manipulate the price of bitcoin. As a result, trading platforms may seek to inflate demand for bitcoin, which could increase the volatility of the price of bitcoin and may significantly influence the market price of the Company s common stock.

 The sale of the Company s digital assets to pay expenses at a time of low digital asset prices may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company may sell its digital assets to pay expenses on an as-needed basis, irrespective of then-current prices. Consequently, the Company s digital assets may be sold at a time when the prices on the respective digital asset exchange market are low, which may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. The development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to use alternative distributed ledgers or other alternatives. The development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies, including competing cryptocurrencies which our miners may not be able to mine, such as cryptocurrencies being developed by popular social media platforms, online retailers, or government sponsored cryptocurrencies, may cause consumers to use alternative distributed ledgers or an alternative to distributed ledgers altogether. Our business utilizes presently existent digital ledgers and blockchains and we could face difficulty adapting to emergent digital ledgers, blockchains, or alternatives thereto. This may adversely affect us and our exposure to various blockchain technologies and prevent us from realizing the anticipated profits from our investments. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine or otherwise acquire or hold for our own account, which could materially and adversely affect investors investments in our securities. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrency systems may lead to slow or inadequate responses to crises, which may negatively affect our business. The decentralized nature of the governance of cryptocurrency systems may lead to ineffective decision making that slows development or prevents a network from overcoming emergent obstacles. Governance of many cryptocurrency systems is by voluntary consensus and open competition with no clear leadership structure or authority. To the extent lack of clarity in corporate governance of cryptocurrency systems leads to ineffective decision making that slows development and growth of such cryptocurrencies, the value of our common stock may be adversely affected. Risks Relating to Regulatory Matters We are subject to a highly-evolving regulatory landscape and any adverse changes to, or our failure to comply with, any laws and regulations could adversely affect our business, reputation, prospects or operations . Until recently, relatively little regulatory attention has been directed toward bitcoin and the bitcoin network by U.S. federal and state governments, foreign governments and self-regulatory agencies. We currently only operate in the United States, and do not currently have any plans to expand our operations beyond the United States. As bitcoin has grown in popularity and in market size, the U.S. regulatory regime namely the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Congress and certain U.S. agencies e.g. , the SEC, the CFTC, FinCEN and the Federal Bureau of Investigation) have begun to examine the operations of the bitcoin network, bitcoin users and the bitcoin exchange market. The complexity and evolving nature of our business and the significant uncertainty surrounding the regulation of the cryptocurrency industry requires us to exercise our judgment as to whether certain laws, rules, and regulations apply to us, and it is possible that governmental bodies and regulators may disagree with our conclusions. To the extent we have not complied with such laws, rules, and regulations, we could be subject to significant fines, revocation of licenses, limitations on our products and services, reputational harm, and other regulatory consequences, each of which may be significant and could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Additionally, the recent bankruptcy filings of FTX, the third largest digital asset exchange by volume at the time of its filing, and its affiliated hedge fund Alameda Research LLC, in addition to other bankruptcy filings of crypto companies throughout calendar year 2022 and the first quarter of 2023, together with the recent closures of Silicon Valley Bank, SBNY and Silvergate Bank, will likely attract heightened regulatory scrutiny from U.S. regulatory agencies such as the SEC and CFTC. Increasing regulation and regulatory scrutiny may result in new costs for the Company and Company s management having to devote increased time and attention to regulatory matters, change aspects of the Company s business or result in limits on the utility of bitcoin. In addition, regulatory developments and/or the Company s business activities may require the Company to comply with certain regulatory regimes. Increasingly strict legal and regulatory requirements and any regulatory investigations and enforcement may result in changes to our business, as well as increased costs, and supervision and examination for ourselves and our service providers. Moreover, new laws, regulations, or interpretations may result in additional litigation, regulatory investigations, and enforcement or other actions. Adverse

 changes to, or our failure to comply with, any laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on our reputation and brand and our business, operating results, and financial condition. Additionally, although we are not directly connected to the recent cryptocurrency market events, we may still suffer reputational harm due to our association with the cryptocurrency industry in light of the recent disruption in the crypto asset markets. Ongoing and future regulation and regulatory actions could significantly restrict or eliminate the market for or uses of bitcoin and/or may adversely affect the Company s business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. TeraWulf may be at a higher risk of litigation and other legal proceedings due to heightened regulatory scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry, which could ultimately be resolved against TeraWulf, requiring material future cash payments or charges, which could impair TeraWulf s financial condition and results of operations. The size, nature and complexity of the Company s business could make it susceptible to various claims, both in litigation and binding arbitration proceedings, legal proceedings, and government investigations, due to the heightened regulatory scrutiny following the recent disruptions in the crypto asset markets. The Company believes that since cryptocurrency mining, and the digital asset industry generally, is a relatively new business sector, it is more likely subject to government investigation and regulatory determination, particularly following the recent cryptocurrency market participant bankruptcies described elsewhere herein. Any claims, regulatory proceedings or litigation that could arise in the course of the Company s business could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its business or operations, or the industry as a whole. The Company may be classified as an inadvertent investment company. The Company is not engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities and does not hold itself out as being engaged in those activities. Under the Investment Company Act, however, a company may be deemed an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(C) if the value of its investment securities is more than 40 of its total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on a consolidated basis. The Company will be engaging in digital asset mining, the outputs of which are cryptocurrencies, which may be deemed a security. In the event that the digital assets held by the Company exceed 40 of its total assets, exclusive of cash, the Company may inadvertently become an investment company. An inadvertent investment company can avoid being classified as an investment company if it can rely on one of the exclusions under the Investment Company Act. One such exclusion, namely Rule 3a-2 under the Investment Company Act, allows an inadvertent investment company a grace period of one year from the earlier of (i) the date on which an issuer owns securities and/or cash having a value exceeding 50 of the issuer s total assets on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis and (ii) the date on which an issuer owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40 of the value of such issuer s total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. The Company is putting in place policies that it expects will work to keep the digital assets held by the Company at less than 40 of its total assets, liquidating its digital assets or seeking a no-action letter from the SEC if the Company is unable to maintain sufficient total assets or liquidate sufficient digital assets in a timely manner. As Rule 3a-2 is available to a company no more than once every three years, and assuming no other exclusions are available to the Company, the Company would have to keep within the 40 limit for at least three years after it ceases being an inadvertent investment company. This may limit the Company s ability to make certain investments or enter into joint ventures that could otherwise have a positive impact on the Company s earnings. In any event, the Company does not intend to become an investment company engaged in the business of investing and trading securities. Classification as an investment company under the Investment Company Act requires registration with the SEC. If an investment company fails to register, it would have to stop doing almost all business, and its contracts would become voidable. Registration is time consuming and restrictive and would require a restructuring of the Company s operations, and the Company would be very constrained in the kind of business it could do as a registered investment company. Furthermore, the Company would become subject to substantial regulation concerning management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons and portfolio composition, and would need to file reports under the Investment Company Act regime. The cost of such compliance would result in the Company incurring substantial additional expenses, and the failure to register if required may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.

 It may be illegal now, or in the future, to acquire, own, hold, sell or use digital assets in one or more countries, and ownership of, holding or trading in the Company s securities may also be considered illegal and subject to sanction. Although digital assets are not currently regulated or are lightly regulated in most countries, including the United States, one or more countries, such as China and Russia, may take regulatory actions in the future that severely restricts the right to acquire, own, hold, sell or use digital assets or to exchange digital assets for fiat currency. Such an action may also result in the restriction of ownership, holding or trading in the Company s securities and may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. If regulatory changes or interpretations of the Company s activities require its registration as a money services business under the regulations promulgated by FinCEN under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended, the Company may be required to register and comply with such regulations. To the extent that the activities of the Company cause it to be deemed a money service business under the regulations promulgated by FinCEN under the authority of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended, the Company may be required to comply with FinCEN regulations, including those that would mandate the Company to implement anti-money laundering programs, make certain reports to FinCEN and maintain certain records. To the extent that the activities of the Company cause it to be deemed a money transmitter or equivalent designation under state law of any state in which the Company operates, the Company may be required to seek a license or otherwise register with a state regulator and comply with state regulations that may include the implementation of anti-money laundering programs, maintenance of certain records and other operational requirements. Currently, the New York State Department of Financial Services has finalized its BitLicense framework for businesses that conduct virtual currency business activity, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors has proposed a model form of state level virtual currency regulation and additional state regulators, including those from the States of California, Idaho, Virginia, Kansas, Texas, South Dakota and Washington, have made public statements indicating that virtual currency businesses may be required to seek licenses as money transmitters. In July 2016, the State of North Carolina updated the law to define virtual currency and the activities that trigger licensure in a business-friendly approach that encourages companies to use virtual currency and blockchain technology. Specifically, the North Carolina law does not require miners or software providers to obtain a license for multi-signature software, smart contract platforms, smart property, colored coins and non-hosted, non-custodial wallets. Starting on January 1, 2016, the State of New Hampshire requires anyone who exchanges a digital currency for another currency must become a licensed and bonded money transmitter. In numerous other states, including the States of Connecticut and New Jersey, legislation is being proposed or has been introduced regarding the treatment of bitcoin and other digital assets. The Company will continue to monitor for developments in such legislation, guidance or regulations. Such additional federal or state regulatory obligations may cause the Company to incur extraordinary expenses, possibly affecting an investment in the shares of the Company s common stock in a material and adverse manner. Furthermore, the Company and its service providers may not be capable of complying with certain federal or state regulatory obligations applicable to money services business and money transmitters. If the Company is deemed to be subject to and is determined not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, the Company may act to dissolve and liquidate the Company. Blockchain technology may expose the Company to specially designated nationals or blocked persons or cause it to violate provisions of law. The Company is subject to the rules enforced by The Office of Financial Assets Control of the U.S. Department of Treasury OFAC ), including regarding sanctions and requirements not to conduct business with persons named on its specially designated nationals list. However, because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions, the Company may inadvertently and without its knowledge engage in transactions with persons named on OFAC s specially designated nationals list, which may expose the Company to regulatory sanctions and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.

 The Company may be required to register and comply with bitcoin regulations and, to the extent that the Company decides to continue operations, the required registrations and regulatory compliance steps may result in extraordinary expenses to the Company. Current and future legislation, and other regulatory developments, including interpretations released by a regulatory authority, may impact the manner in which bitcoins are treated for classification and clearing purposes. In particular, bitcoin derivatives are not excluded from the definition of commodity future by the CFTC. The Company cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of bitcoins under the law. Bitcoins have been deemed to fall within the definition of a commodity, and the Company may be required to register and comply with additional regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended, including additional periodic report and disclosure standards and requirements. Moreover, the Company may be required to register as a commodity pool operator and to register us as a commodity pool with the CFTC through the National Futures Association. Such additional registrations may result in extraordinary expenses, thereby materially and adversely affecting the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. If the Company determines it will not comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, it may seek to cease certain of its operations. Any such action may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company is not aware of any rules that have been proposed to regulate bitcoins as securities. However, the Company cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of bitcoins under the law. If federal or state legislatures or agencies initiate or release tax determinations that change the classification of bitcoins as property for tax purposes (in the context of when such bitcoins are held as an investment), such determination could have a negative tax consequence on the Company or its shareholders. Current guidance from the Internal Revenue Service indicates that digital assets such as bitcoin should be treated and taxed as property and that transactions involving the payment of bitcoin for goods and services should be treated as barter transactions. While this treatment creates a potential tax reporting requirement for any circumstance where the ownership of a bitcoin passes from one person to another, usually by means of bitcoin transactions (including off-blockchain transactions), it would also apply capital gains treatment to those transactions which may adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations. Under certain recently proposed legislation, substantial tax compliance burdens may be imposed on the Company relating to the tax reporting of bitcoin and bitcoin-related transactions. Legislation recently passed in the Senate would impose substantial tax compliance obligations on the Company relating to the reporting of bitcoin and bitcoin-related transactions. Under this legislation, it is possible that the Company would be treated as a digital assets broker and required to deliver certain tax forms in connection with the validation of blockchain transactions. Were this legislation to be passed in the House and enacted unchanged, the Company could face tax reporting and compliance mandates that it may not have the information or resources to fully comply with. Although the current legislation may not be enacted in its current form, future legislation may impose similar tax compliance responsibilities on the Company, which may be expensive and burdensome to comply with, and which could, as a result, adversely impact the Company s operations. The Company will continue to monitor for developments in such legislation, guidance or regulations. The Company s bitcoin holdings could subject it to regulatory scrutiny. Several bitcoin investment vehicles have attempted to list their shares on a U.S. national securities exchange to permit them to function in the manner of an exchange-traded fund with continuous share creation and redemption at net asset value. To date the SEC has declined to approve any such listing, citing concerns over the surveillance of trading in markets for the underlying bitcoin as well as concerns about fraud and manipulation in bitcoin trading markets. Even though the Company does not function in the manner of an exchange-traded fund and does not offer continuous share creation and redemption at net asset value, it is possible that the Company nevertheless could face regulatory scrutiny from the SEC, as a company with securities traded on Nasdaq.

 In addition, as digital assets, including bitcoin, have grown in popularity and market size, there has been increasing focus on the extent to which digital assets can be used to launder the proceeds of illegal activities or fund criminal or terrorist activities or entities subject to sanctions regimes. While the Company maintains risk-based procedures reasonably designed to promote compliance with applicable anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations and takes care to only acquire bitcoin through entities subject to anti money laundering regulation and related compliance rules in the United States, if it is found to have purchased any bitcoin from bad actors that have used bitcoin to launder money or persons subject to sanctions, the Company is and may continue to be subject to regulatory proceedings and further transactions or dealings in bitcoin may be restricted or prohibited. Due to the unregulated nature and lack of transparency surrounding the operations of many bitcoin trading venues, they may experience fraud, security failures or operational problems, which may adversely affect the value of the Company s bitcoin holdings. Bitcoin trading venues are relatively new and, in some cases, unregulated. Furthermore, there are many bitcoin trading venues which do not provide the public with significant information regarding their ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices and regulatory compliance. As a result, the marketplace may lose confidence in bitcoin trading venues, including prominent exchanges that handle a significant volume of bitcoin trading. Negative perception, a lack of stability in the broader bitcoin markets and the closure or temporary shutdown of bitcoin trading venues due to fraud, business failure, hackers or malware or government- mandated regulation may reduce confidence in bitcoin and result in greater volatility in the prices of bitcoin. To the extent investors view the Company s common stock as linked to the value of the Company s bitcoin holdings, these potential consequences of a bitcoin trading venue s failure could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Company s common stock. Risks Related to our Common Stock If we fail to regain compliance with the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, our common stock may be delisted and the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted. On March 17, 2023, we received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market, or Nasdaq, notifying us that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum 1.00 per share requirement for continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Capital Market, referred to as the minimum bid price rule. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules, we were provided an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until September 13, 2023, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price rule. If we do not regain compliance with the minimum bid price rule by the required date and we are not eligible for any additional compliance period at that time, the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department staff will provide us written notification that our common stock may be delisted. At that time, we may appeal the staff s delisting determination to a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel. We expect that our common stock would remain listed pending the panel s decision. However, there can be no assurance that, even if we appeal the staff s delisting determination to the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel, such appeal would be successful. There are many factors that may adversely affect our minimum bid price, including those described throughout this section titled Risk Factors. Many of these factors are outside of our control. As a result, we may not be able to sustain compliance with the minimum bid price rule in the long term. Any potential delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market would likely result in decreased liquidity and increased volatility for our common stock and would adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or to enter into strategic transactions. Any potential delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market would also make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell our common stock in the public market. We do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. In the past, we have not paid dividends on our common stock. We do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and we intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of certain existing and any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock may be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.

 The market price of our Common Stock may be volatile as a result of recent geopolitical, economic or industry-wide developments, which could subject us to securities class action litigation and result in substantial losses for our stockholders. The market price of our Common Stock could be subject to extreme volatility and fluctuations in response to recent industry-wide developments beyond our control, such as continued industry-wide fallout from the recent closures of Silicon Valley Bank, SBNY and Silvergate Bank and/or Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings of cryptocurrency exchange FTX (including its affiliated hedge fund Alameda Research LLC), crypto hedge fund Three Arrows and crypto lenders Celsius, Voyager, BlockFi, and Genesis, as well as the many risk factors listed in this Form 10-K. As mentioned elsewhere herein, we have no material direct exposure to Silicon Valley Bank or Silvergate Bank, nor do we have any direct exposure to any of the cryptocurrency market participants that recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, including Genesis, whose parent company, DCG, also owns Foundry, our mining pool provider. At this time, the Company is not subject to any material risks arising from its indirect exposure to Genesis . We also have no direct exposure to any of the cryptocurrency market participants who are known to have experienced excessive redemptions, suspended redemptions or have crypto assets of their customers unaccounted for, and we do not have any assets, material or otherwise, that may not be recovered due to these bankruptcies or excessive or suspended redemptions. Nevertheless, the price of our Common Stock may still not be immune to unfavorable investor sentiment resulting from these recent developments in the broader cryptocurrency industry. Furthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market fluctuations as well as general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, high inflation, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our Common Stock. In addition, such fluctuations could subject us to securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention from other business concerns, which could potentially harm our business. As a result of this volatility, our stockholders may not be able to sell their shares of Common Stock at or above the price at which they purchased their shares of Common Stock. ITEM 1B.

All figures presented below represent results from continuing operations, unless otherwise specified. Certain statements contained in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations may be deemed forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements. General TeraWulf is a vertically-integrated owner and operator of environmentally clean bitcoin mining facilities in the United States. Founded and led by an experienced group of energy power entrepreneurs , the Company is actively operating and constructing, consistent with its sustainable energy mandate, two bitcoin mining facilities, the Lake Mariner Facility and the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility, in the States of New York and Pennsylvania, respectively. TeraWulf will own and operate its bitcoin mining facility sites and expects to consume over 91 zero-carbon energy, with a target of achieving 100 . In connection with the planned buildout, TeraWulf entered into a power purchase agreement at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility and will receive power at approximately 2.0 cents/kWh. Moreover, the Lake Mariner Facility is located a mere 40 miles from the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant, an approximate 2,600MW hydroelectric generating facility, the largest generating facility in New York State, and one of the largest in the country, with 24/7 access to low-cost carbon-free electricity. With the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility power purchase agreement, and the strategic location of the Lake Mariner Facility addition, TeraWulf expects to achieve an average long-term cost of electricity of approximately 3.5 cents/kWh, competitively positioning the Company to be a leading, low-cost and zero-carbon bitcoin mining operator in the United States.

 Lake Mariner Facility Located at a site adjacent to the decommissioned coal-fired Somerset Generating Station in Barker, New York, the Lake Mariner Facility has secured an initial 90 MW of energy to support its bitcoin mining capacity through an agreement with NYPA with the potential to expand into an additional 410 MW of energy supply. TeraWulf began mining bitcoin at the Lake Mariner Facility in March 2022 with 10 MW of mining capacity located on the turbine deck of the former coal-fired power plant and energized its first dedicated mining building Building 1 ), housing approximately 50 MW of mining capacity, during the third quarter of 2022. During the third quarter of 2022, and in conjunction with Nautilus JV amendment discussed below, the Company expanded its self-mining capacity in Building 1 by transferring miners previously purchased for use at the Nautilus facility in order to accelerate revenue growth. Construction is largely complete at the Company s second dedicated mining building Building 2 ), which is also scheduled to house approximately 50MW of mining capacity and is targeted for completion in the second quarter of 2023. Nautilus Cryptomine Facility The Nautilus Cryptomine Facility is a joint venture between TeraWulf and Talen . The Nautilus Cryptomine Facility, located in Salem Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, is adjacent to the 2.5 GW nuclear-powered Susquehanna Station, 2.3 GW of which are owned and operated by Talen. The Nautilus Cryptomine Facility has secured as its power supply zero-carbon nuclear energy received directly from a substation connected to the Susquehanna Station s electrical generators over a five-year term with two successive three-year renewal options. The Nautilus Cryptomine Facility is located behind the meter and not connected to the electrical distribution grid, therefore avoiding transmission and distribution charges typically paid by other large power consumers. At the time of this Annual Report, the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility has access to up to 300 MW of bitcoin mining capacity from the Susquehanna Station and is expected to be the first bitcoin mining facility site that is powered by 100 behind the meter zero-carbon nuclear energy. TeraWulf began installation of miners at the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility in the fourth quarter of 2022, and began mining bitcoin in the first quarter of 2023. In August 2022, the Company and Talen amended their joint venture agreement thereby reducing TeraWulf s stake in the facility to 25 and right-sizing TeraWulf s miners and infrastructure to enable maximum utilization of 50 MW of power at approximately 2.0 cents/kWh for five years. TeraWulf expects to generate revenues primarily by sustainably mining bitcoin at its bitcoin mining facility sites. Incremental revenues may be generated through the hedging and sale of mined bitcoin and the commercial optimization of TeraWulf s power supply. The Company will also leverage its available digital infrastructure to provide miner hosting services to third parties whereby the Company targets holding an option to purchase the hosted miners in the future. We believe TeraWulf is an important and low-cost player in the bitcoin network due to our vertical integration, ramp of large-scale operations, market-leading zero-carbon power supply arrangements and a seasoned, dedicated senior management team. Recent Developments February 2023 Equity Offering On February 6, 2023, TeraWulf completed an underwritten public offering of 36,764,706 shares of common stock (the Equity Offering at a public offering price of 0.68 per share, with JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC JonesTrading acting as sole book-running manager (the Underwriter for the Equity Offering.

Commencing June 30, 2022, unpaid dividends will be accreted to, and increase, the liquidation preference of the Convertible Preferred Stock. The initial liquidation preference is 1,000 per share. The Conversion Price is determined by dividing 1,000 by the Conversion Rate, as defined, which is initially 100 shares of Common Stock per 1,000 liquidation preference of Convertible Preferred Stock. Cumulative dividends of 0.8 million were accumulated and accreted to liquidation preference as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate liquidation preference of the Convertible Preferred Stock was approximately 10.3 million. Long-term Debt Amendments. In July 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to is Loan, Guaranty and Security Agreement (the LGSA ). This amendment provides for an additional 50.0 million term loan facility (the New Term Facility ). The New Term Facility has a maturity date of December 1, 2024, consistent with the existing term loans under the LGSA. The interest rate with respect to the New Term Facility is consistent with the existing term loans under the LGSA, but is subject to increase upon the occurrence of certain conditions. Pursuant to the New Term Facility, funds can be drawn in three tranches. The 15.0 million first tranche was drawn at closing in July 2022, and the subsequent tranches of up to 35 million may be drawn at Company s option, subject to certain conditions, including the raising of matching junior capital, as defined. The amortization with respect to the first tranche of the New Term Facility is consistent with existing term loans under the LGSA. The loans under the subsequent tranches of the New Term Facility are repayable in quarterly installments on (i) April 5, 2024 and July 8, 2024, equal to 12.50 of the original principal amount advanced under such tranches under the LGSA and (ii) October 7, 2024, equal to 37.5 of the original principal amount advanced under such tranches of the LGSA. The New Term Facility required the Company to extend the initial term of the Ground Lease from five years to eight years. In connection with the New Term Facility, the Company issued warrants to the lenders under the New Term Facility to purchase 5,787,732 shares of Common Stock at 0.01 per share, an aggregate number of shares of the Company s Common Stock equal to 5.0 of the fully diluted equity of the Company. If the Company draws subsequent tranches, it is required to issue warrants to the lenders to purchase shares of the Company s Common Stock equal to dilution of 3.75 and 4.25 of the then fully diluted equity of the Company, respectively. A certain portion of the Warrants issued under the Warrant Agreement were subject to cancellation, upon the occurrence of certain conditions.; however, the time period for potential warrant cancellation has expired and no warrants were cancelled. In October 2022, the Company entered into a third amendment (the Third Amendment to the LGSA. The Third Amendment divides the initial funding of up to 15,000,000 of the delayed draw term loan commitment under the LGSA into two tranches of up to 7,500,000 each. The first tranche of 7,500,000 was borrowed upon the effectiveness of the Third Amendment on October 7, 2022. In connection with the Third Amendment described above, the Company entered into an amendment and restatement of the warrant agreement related to the New Term Facility. The amended and restated warrant agreement provides that holders party thereto are entitled to additional warrants to purchase an aggregate number of shares of Common Stock equal to an incremental 3.75 , to be divided into two separate increments of 1.875 each, of the fully diluted equity of the Company, determined on the date of the funding of the two separate sub-tranches of 7,500,000 each pursuant to the Third Amendment. On October 7, 2022. the Company issued warrants to purchase 2,667,678 shares of Common Stock at 0.01 per share. Convertible Promissory Notes. In November 2022, the Company issued convertible promissory notes (the Convertible Notes in an aggregate principal amount of approximately 3.4 million to certain accredited investors, including to members of Company management in the amount of 1.7 million. The Convertible Notes were issued in privately negotiated transactions as part of a private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Convertible Notes, which contain usual and customary antidilution provisions, have a maturity date of April 1, 2025 and accrue annual interest at a rate of 4 , which increases to 15 upon the occurrence of an event of default, as defined. The Convertible Notes are automatically convertible into shares of equity securities of the Company upon the closing of a Qualified Financing, as defined in the Convertible Notes as the issuance and sale of equity securities with an aggregate gross sales price of not less than 5.0 million, with certain sales of equity securities excluded, at a conversion price equal to the price per share paid by the investors purchasing such equity securities in such Qualified Financing. On December 12, 2022, the Company entered into a private placement which met the definition of a Qualified Financing and contemporaneously amended the Convertible Notes to (a) change the conversion date to March 1, 2023 and (b) allow for the conversion price to be reduced if an additional Qualified Financing were to occur prior to the conversion date at a price lower than the then existing Convertible Note conversion price. As of December 31, 2022, the conversion price was 0.40 per share of Common Stock.

 SEPA. On June 2, 2022, in order to facilitate additional capital acquisition, the Company entered into the Standby Equity Purchase Agreement SEPA with YA II PN, Ltd. Yorkville ). Pursuant to the SEPA, the Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Yorkville up to 50.0 million of its shares of Common Stock, at the Company s request any time during the commitment period commencing on June 2, 2022 and terminating on the earliest of (i) the first day of the month following the 36-month anniversary of the SEPA and (ii) the date on which Yorkville shall have made payment of any advances requested pursuant to the SEPA for shares of the Common Stock equal to the commitment amount of 50.0 million. In addition to the Company s right to request Advances, subject to certain conditions precedent, the Company had the option to, but was not obligated to, effect a pre-advance loan with a principal amount of 15.0 million through the issuance and sale to Yorkville of a convertible promissory note (the Promissory Note ). The Company elected to issue and sell the Promissory Note to Yorkville on June 2, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company sold 91,405 shares of Common Stock for net proceeds of 250,000. The Company fully repaid the Promissory Note, substantially in cash, and the SEPA has been cancelled as of December 31, 2022. The Company has invested 61.1 million and 109.1 million in the buildout of mining facilities for the year ended December 31, 2022 and the period February 8, 2021 (date of inception) to December 31, 2021, respectively, and 46.2 million and 82.1 million in the Nautilus joint venture for the year ended December 31, 2022 and the period February 8, 2021 (date of inception) to December 31, 2021, respectively. The Lake Mariner facility commenced operations in March 2022 and the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility commenced operations in February 2023. These facilities are expected to reach an aggregate 160 MW of net bitcoin mining capacity with a capacity to support 50,000 miners and over 5.5 EH/s of computational power by early in the second quarter of 2023. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company accomplished several notable steps toward achieving near term positive cash flows from operations, namely: (1) the Company amended its long-term debt agreement to, among other changes, remove the fixed principal amortization through April 7, 2024 and, potentially, beyond, (2) through the issuance of Common Stock, Common Stock warrants and convertible promissory notes, the Company received net proceeds of 34.3 million, which along with cash flow from operations, is expected to be sufficient to satisfy the Company s final capital expenditure requirements, other obligations and operating expenses in the months prior to achieving a free cash flow positive enterprise (3) mining activities have commenced at the Nautilus Facility and the Company deems that it has funded all known and expected capital commitments, (4) the Company received materially all contracted miners from the miner suppliers and has no remaining outstanding financial commitments under the miner purchase agreements, (5) the received miners are sufficient to fully utilize mining capacity both in service and under construction at the Lake Mariner Facility and the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility and (6) the remaining construction activities at the Lake Mariner Facility and the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility are currently ongoing and expected to be complete in the second quarter of 2023. The Company has determined that it is probable that these actions will allow the Company to generate positive cash flows from operations and be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business and, therefore, there is no longer substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern through at least the next twelve months. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from TeraWulf s possible inability to continue as a going concern. However, the ability to raise funds , if required, through the sale of equity, debt financings, or the sale of bitcoin to expand and maintain our operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties and, even if we were successful, future equity issuances or convertible debt or preferred stock offerings could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and any future debt or debt securities may contain covenants that limit our operations or ability to enter into certain transactions. Our ability to realize revenue through bitcoin mining and successfully convert bitcoin into cash or fund overhead with bitcoin is subject to a number of risks, including regulatory, financial and business risks, many of which are beyond our control. Additionally, bitcoin has experienced significant historical volatility in its market price and, as such, future prices cannot be predicted. See the discussion of risks affecting the Company s business under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The above discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements requires the application of accounting policies and the use of estimates. The accounting policies most important to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and estimates that require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments are described below. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of the Company s significant accounting policies.

 Variable Interest Entities Variable interest entities VIE are legal entities in which equity investors do not have (i) sufficient equity at risk for the legal entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or (ii) as a group, the power, through voting or similar rights, to direct the activities of the legal entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance, or (iii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the legal entity or the right to receive expected residual returns of the legal entity. The Company would consolidate any VIE in which it has a controlling financial interest through being deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE has both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance; and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. If both characteristics are met, the Company considers itself to be the primary beneficiary and therefore will consolidate that VIE into its consolidated financial statements. The Company determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE upon initial involvement with a VIE and reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis. The determination of whether an entity is a VIE and whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE is based upon facts and circumstances for the VIE and requires significant judgments such as whether the entity is a VIE, whether the Company s interest in a VIE is a variable interest, the determination of the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity, whether the Company controls those activities, and whether the Company has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. In 2021, the Company entered into a joint venture, Nautilus Cryptomine LLC Nautilus ), with an unrelated co-venturer to develop, construct and operate a bitcoin mining facility in Pennsylvania. Due to the initial nature of the joint venture and the continued commitment for additional financing, the Company determined Nautilus is a VIE. While the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over Nautilus, the Company has determined that it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Nautilus. Initially, the power to direct the activities of Nautilus that most significantly impact Nautilus economic performance were shared equally by both parties within the joint venture due to the requirement for both equity holders to approve many of the key operating decisions and when not equally shared, were predominantly under the control of the co-venturer, including through the co-venturer s majority representation on the board of managers. As such, the Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of Nautilus and, therefore, has accounted for this entity under the equity method of accounting. Risks associated with the Company s involvement with Nautilus include a commitment to potentially fund additional equity investments. During the year ended December 31, 0222, the Company reduced its ownership interest in Nautilus to 25.2 . Mining Pool The Company has entered into an arrangement with a cryptocurrency mining pool (the Foundry USA Pool) to provide computing power to the mining pool in exchange for consideration. The arrangement is terminable at any time without substantial penalty by either party and the contract term is deemed to be 24 hours. The Company s enforceable right to compensation only begins when and continues while the Company provides computing power to its customer, the mining pool operator. The mining pool applies the Full Pay Per Share FPPS model. Under the FPPS model, in exchange for providing computing power to the pool, the Company is entitled to pay-per-share base amount and transaction fee reward compensation, calculated on a daily basis, at an amount that approximates the total bitcoin that could have been mined and transaction fees that could have been awarded using the Company s computing power, based upon the then current blockchain difficulty. Under this model, the Company is entitled to compensation regardless of whether the pool operator successfully records a block to the bitcoin blockchain. Providing computing power to a mining pool for cryptocurrency transaction verification services is an output of the Company s ordinary activities. The provision of such computing power is the sole performance obligation. The transaction consideration the Company receives, if any, is non-cash consideration and is all variable. Because cryptocurrency is considered non-cash consideration, fair value of the cryptocurrency award received is determined using the quoted price of the related cryptocurrency in the Company s principal market at the time of contract inception, which is deemed daily. Revenue is recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. After every 24-hour contract term, the mining pool transfers the cryptocurrency consideration to our designated cryptocurrency wallet. There is no significant financing component in these transactions. There may be, however, consideration payable to the customer in the form of a pool operator fee; this fee, if any, is deducted from the proceeds the Company receives and is recorded as contra-revenue, as it does not represent a payment for a distinct good or service.

 Data Center Hosting The Company s current hosting contracts are service contracts with a single performance obligation. The service the Company provides primarily includes hosting the customers miners in a physically secure data center with electrical power, internet connectivity, ambient air cooling and available maintenance resources. Hosting revenue is recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Company s performance. The Company recognizes hosting revenue to the extent that a significant reversal of such revenue will not occur. Data center hosting customers are invoiced and payments are due on a monthly basis. While the majority of consideration is paid in cash, certain consideration is payable in cryptocurrency. Because cryptocurrency is considered non-cash consideration, fair value of the cryptocurrency award received is determined using the quoted price of the related cryptocurrency in the Company s principal market at the time of contract inception. The Company has one data center hosting contract with a customer, which expires in December 2023, for which the quoted price of bitcoin in the Company s principal market at the time of contract inception was approximately 38,000. The Company recorded miner hosting revenue of 4.6 million and 0 during the year ended December 31, 2022 and the period February 8, 2021 (date of inception) to December 31, 2021, respectively. Cryptocurrencies Cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, are included in current assets in the consolidated balance sheets due to the Company s ability to sell it in a highly liquid marketplace and its intent to liquidate its cryptocurrencies to support operations when needed. Cryptocurrencies earned by the Company through the provision of computing power to a mining pool and hosting activities are accounted for in connection with the Company s revenue recognition policy disclosed above. Cryptocurrencies are accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment on a continuous basis through the entirety of its holding period. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, which is measured using the quoted price of the cryptocurrency at the time its fair value is being measured, which is based on the intraday low quoted price of the cryptocurrency reported in the Company s principal market. To the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted. Sales of cryptocurrencies by the Company and cryptocurrencies awarded to the Company, including as compensation for data center hosting services, are included within cash flows from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company will account for its gains or losses in accordance with the first in first out FIFO method of accounting. Issuance of Debt with Common Stock or Warrants; Debt Modification On December 1, 2021, TeraCub entered into a the LGSA, which consists of a 123.5 million term loan facility. In connection with the LGSA, the Company issued to the holders of the Term Loan 839,398 shares of Common Stock, which is a quantity of Common Stock representing 1.5 of the outstanding shares of the publicly registered shares of TeraWulf subsequent to the Closing. The allocation of proceeds between the debt instrument and any other components included in the debt issuance, including Common Stock, is generally based on the relative fair value allocation method. In applying the relative fair value allocation method, the determination of the fair value of the Common Stock issued and the fair value of the Term Loan independent of the Common Stock issued requires significant judgment. As a measure of sensitivity, a 10 change in the estimated fair value of the Term Loan component would result in a 1.9 million change in the fair value allocated to each of the Term Loan and equity components. In July 2022, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the LGSA, which included an additional borrowing of 15.0 million and the issuance of warrants to purchase 3,472,640 shares of Common Stock at 0.01 per share. The accounting for debt modifications is complex and requires significant judgment. Potential accounting outcomes include troubled debt restructuring accounting, extinguishment accounting or modification accounting, each with different implications for the consolidated financial statements. The Company has determined that modification accounting is applicable. Additionally, debt modification accounting requires the determination of the fair value of the warrants issued, which requires significant judgment. As a measure of sensitivity, a 10 change in the estimated fair value of the warrants would result in a 0.3 million change in the recorded value of the borrowing under the First Amendment. In October 2022, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to the LGSA, which included an additional borrowing of 7.5 million and the issuance of warrants to purchase 2,667,678 shares of Common Stock at 0.01 per share. The accounting for debt modifications is complex and requires significant judgment. Potential accounting outcomes include troubled debt restructuring

 accounting, extinguishment accounting or modification accounting, each with different implications for the consolidated financial statements. The Company has determined that modification accounting is applicable. Additionally, debt modification accounting requires the determination of the fair value of the warrants issued, which requires significant judgment. As a measure of sensitivity, a 10 change in the estimated fair value of the warrants would result in a 0.2 million change in the recorded value of the borrowing under the Third Amendment. Convertible Instruments The Company accounts for its issuance of convertible debt and convertible equity instruments in accordance with applicable U.S. GAAP. In connection with that accounting, the Company assesses the various terms and features of the agreement in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC No. 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 and ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging Activities ASC 815 ). ASC 480 requires liability accounting for certain financial instruments, including shares that embody an unconditional obligation to transfer a variable number of shares, provided that the monetary value of the obligation is based solely or predominantly on one of the following three characteristics: (1) a fixed monetary amount known at inception, (2) variations in something other than the fair value of the issuer s equity shares or (3) variations in the fair value of the issuer s equity shares, but the monetary value to the counterparty moves in the opposite direction as the value of the issuer s shares. In accordance with ASC 815, the Company assesses the various terms and features of the agreement to determine whether or not they contain embedded derivative instruments that are required under ASC 815 to be accounted for separately from the host contract and recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The fair value of derivative liabilities, if any, is required to be revalued at each reporting date, with corresponding changes in fair value recorded in current period operating results. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provision of Accounting Standards Codification ASC 740-10, Accounting for Income Taxes which requires, among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company follows the provision of the ASC 740-10 related to Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions. When tax returns are filed, it is more likely than not that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely that not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with the tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the Company s balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The most critical estimate for income taxes is the determination of whether to record a valuation allowance for any net deferred tax asset, including net loss carryforwards, whereby management must estimate whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset would be realized.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of TeraWulf Inc. and Subsidiaries Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TeraWulf Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from February 8, 2021 (date of inception) to December 31, 2021, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from February 8, 2021 (date of inception) to December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Revenue recognition from mining pool As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, providing computing power to a mining pool for cryptocurrency transaction verification services is a performance obligation. The transaction price is measured at the fair value of the noncash consideration using the quoted price of the awarded cryptocurrency in the Company s principal market at contract inception. We identified the determination of contract inception as a critical audit matter due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to evaluate management s determination of each contractual period. The nature and extent of audit effort required to address the matter included significant involvement of more experienced engagement team members and discussions and consultations with professionals with specialized skills and knowledge related to the matter. Our audit procedures related to the determination of contract inception included the following, among others: We assessed the mining pool s payout methodology and the provisions of the service agreement between the Company and the mining pool operator. We evaluated the Company s performance obligation and 24-hour contractual period with respect to its agreement with the mining pool operator.

 bitcoin mining facilities are in New York (the Lake Mariner Facility and Pennsylvania (the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility ). Mining operations commenced at the Lake Mariner Facility in March 2022 and the Company has energized building one and substantially completed the construction of building two as of December 31, 2022. The Nautilus Cryptomine Facility is being developed and constructed through a joint venture (see Note 11) and remained under construction as of December 31, 2022, with mining operations commencing in February 2023. The Lake Mariner Facility is wholly-owned. In May 2021, TeraWulf created wholly-owned subsidiaries to facilitate ownership of bitcoin mining facilities or joint venture interests related thereto. Lake Mariner Data LLC and Kyalami Data LLC are subsidiaries involved in operating, constructing or developing wholly-owned bitcoin mining facilities in New York. As of the date these consolidated financial statements were available to be issued, Kayalami Data LLC was inactive. TeraWulf (Thales) LLC Thales is a subsidiary holding interests in a joint venture involved in constructing bitcoin mining facilities in Pennsylvania (see Note 11). IKONICS traditional business was the development and manufacturing of high-quality photochemical imaging systems for sale primarily to a wide range of printers and decorators of surfaces. Customers applications were primarily screen printing and abrasive etching. TeraWulf initially classified the IKONICS business as held for sale and discontinued operations in these consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company completed sales of substantially all of IKONICS historical net assets (see Note 4). Subsequent to the asset sales, IKONICS name was changed to RM 101 Inc. RM 101 ). Risks and Uncertainties Liquidity and Financial Condition The Company incurred a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million, including a net impairment charge (net of a contingent consideration remeasurement gain) of million included in loss from discontinued operations, net of tax related to the acquired RM 101 business (see Notes 3 and 4), and negative cash flows from continuing operations of million for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had balances of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of million, a working capital deficiency of million, total stockholders equity of million and an accumulated deficit of million. The Company has commenced mining activities at the Lake Mariner Facility, however not yet to the scale required to support its principal operations. The Company has relied primarily on proceeds from its issuances of debt and equity and sale of bitcoin mined to fund its principal operations.

 million for purchases of and deposits on plant and equipment, including deposits on miners under miner purchase agreements (see Note 12). Also, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company invested million, net in its joint venture (see Note 11). As of December 31, 2022, the Company required additional capital in order to fund construction completion of the Lake Mariner Facility. Until TeraWulf is able to generate positive cash flows from operations, TeraWulf expects to fund its business operations and infrastructure buildout through the issuance of debt or equity securities, sales of mined bitcoin or through the provision of miner hosting services. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement for sale of shares of Common Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million (the ATM Offering ). The issuance of Common Stock under this agreement will be made pursuant to the Company s effective registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration statement No. 333-262226). During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued Common Stock, including under the ATM Offering, for net cash proceeds of million, Common Stock warrants for net cash proceeds of million, preferred stock for net cash proceeds of million, convertible promissory notes, net of cash payments, for net cash proceeds of million and long-term debt for net cash proceeds of million. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company accomplished several notable steps toward achieving near term positive cash flows from operations, namely: (1) the Company amended its long-term debt agreement (see Notes 9 and 18) to, among other changes, remove the fixed principal amortization through April 7, 2024 and, potentially, beyond, (2) through the issuance of Common Stock, Common Stock warrants and convertible promissory notes (see Note 19), the Company received net proceeds of million, which along with cash flow from operations, is expected to be sufficient to satisfy the Company s final capital expenditure requirements, other obligations and operating expenses in the months prior to achieving a free cash flow positive enterprise (3) mining activities have commenced at the Nautilus Facility and the Company deems that it has funded all known and expected capital commitments, (4) the Company received materially all contracted miners from the miner suppliers and has no remaining outstanding financial commitments under the miner purchase agreements (see Notes 11 and 12), (5) the received miners are sufficient to fully utilize mining capacity both in service and under construction at the Lake Mariner Facility and the Nautilus Facility and (6) the remaining construction activities at the Lake Mariner Facility and the Nautilus Facility are currently ongoing and expected to be complete in the second quarter of 2023. The Company has determined that it is probable that these actions will allow the Company to generate positive cash flows from operations and be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business and, therefore, there is no longer substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern through at least the next twelve months. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from TeraWulf s possible inability to continue as a going concern. COVID-19 The Company s results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the economy and in the global financial markets, including conditions that are outside of the Company s control, such as the outbreak and global spread of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 ). The COVID-19 pandemic that was declared on March 11, 2020 has caused significant economic dislocation in the United States and globally as governments across the world, including the United States, introduced measures aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19. The spread of COVID-19 and the imposition of related public health measures have resulted in, and are expected to continue to result in, increased volatility and uncertainty in the cryptocurrency space. Any severe or prolonged economic downturn, as result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, could result in a variety of risks to the business and management cannot anticipate all the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact its business.

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, prepaid expenses, amounts due from related parties, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued construction liabilities, other accrued liabilities and other amounts due to related parties are considered to be representative of their respective fair values principally due to their short-term maturities.

 ITEM 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In connection with this 2022 Form 10-K, our management evaluated, with the participation of our current chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our Certifying Officers ), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation and in light of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as described below, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and our expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our directors and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making the assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, management has utilized the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, (2013 framework) COSO ). Based on our evaluation under the COSO criteria, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As part of the Company s financial statement close process and preparation of the 2022 Form 10-K, the Company identified errors in its historical interim unaudited financial statements. The misstatements relate solely to incorrectly calculating the impact of noncash activity on purchase and deposits on plant and equipment, resulting in an understatement of net cash used in investing activities and a corresponding overstatement of net cash used in operating activities as originally included in the respective unaudited consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company determined that its interim unaudited consolidated financial statements for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022 were materially misstated and needed to be restated. The restatements are presented in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.

 As a result of the misstatements, management and the Company s audit committee have determined that a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting existed as of December 31, 2022. The material weakness relates to the inadequate design and operation of management s review controls over identification of noncash activity on purchase and deposits on plant and equipment in the preparation in its consolidated statements of cash flows. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements As part of the Company s financial statement close process and preparation of the 2022 Form 10-K, the Company identified errors in its historical interim unaudited financial statements. The misstatements relate solely to incorrectly calculating the impact of noncash activity on purchase and deposits on plant and equipment, resulting in an understatement of net cash used in investing activities and a corresponding overstatement of net cash used in operating activities as originally included in the respective unaudited consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company determined that its interim unaudited consolidated financial statements for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022 were materially misstated and needed to be restated. The restatements are presented in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting To remediate this material weakness, we have added procedures to our review controls related to the accounting for identification of noncash activity on purchase and deposits on plant and equipment to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until management designs and implements effective controls that operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are effective. Other as described above, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects. ITEM 9B. Other Information Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review. As part of the Company s financial statement close process and preparation of the 2022 Form 10-K, the Company identified errors in its historical interim unaudited consolidated financial statements. The misstatements relate solely to incorrectly calculating the impact of noncash activity on purchase and deposits on plant and equipment, resulting in an understatement of net cash used in investing activities and a corresponding overstatement of net cash used in operating activities as originally included in the respective unaudited consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company determined that its interim unaudited consolidated financial statements for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022 were materially misstated and needed to be restated. On March 29, 2023, the Audit Committee of the Company s Board of Directors, based on the recommendation of management of the Company and after consultation with RSM US LLP, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, concluded that the Company s previously issued interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the first three quarters of 2022 (collectively, the Relevant Periods ), as well as the associated earnings press releases, were materially misstated and therefore the financial statements should be restated and the financial statements and earnings press releases should no longer be relied upon. The Company will correct for such misstatements by restating its financial information as of and for the Relevant Periods in the 2022 Form 10-K. Additionally, the Company has determined that a material weakness existed in its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The material weakness relates to the inadequate design and operation of management s review controls over identification of noncash activity on purchase and deposits on plant and equipment in the preparation of the Company s consolidated statements of cash flows.
