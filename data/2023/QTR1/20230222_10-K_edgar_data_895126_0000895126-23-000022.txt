Forward-looking statements include our current expectations or forecasts of future events, including matters relating to the continuing effects of the impact of inflation and commodity price volatility resulting from Russia s invasion of Ukraine, COVID-19 and related supply chain constraints, and the impact of each on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, the potential effects of the Plan on our operations, management, and employees, actions by, or disputes among or between, members of OPEC+ and other foreign oil-exporting countries, market factors, market prices, our ability to meet debt service requirements, our ability to continue to pay cash dividends, the amount and timing of any cash dividends and our ESG initiatives. Forward-looking and other statements in this Form 10-K regarding our environmental, social and other sustainability plans and goals are not an indication that these statements are necessarily material to investors or required to be disclosed in our filings with the SEC. In addition, historical, current, and forward-looking environmental, social and sustainability-related statements may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future.

 PART I 
 
 ITEM 1. Business 
 Unless the context otherwise requires, references to Chesapeake, the Company, us, we and our in this report are to Chesapeake Energy Corporation together with its subsidiaries. Our principal executive offices are located at 6100 North Western Avenue, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73118, and our main telephone number at that location is (405) 848-8000. 
 
 Our Business 
 We are an independent exploration and production company engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of properties to produce natural gas, oil and NGL from underground reservoirs. We own a large portfolio of onshore U.S. unconventional natural gas and liquids assets, including interests in approximately 8,400 gross natural gas and oil wells. 
 On August 2, 2022, we announced that our Eagle Ford assets were non-core to our future capital allocation strategy. While continuing to focus our capital on the premium rock, returns and runway of our Marcellus and Haynesville positions, on January 17, 2023, we entered into an agreement to sell a portion of our Eagle Ford assets to WildFire Energy I LLC for 1.425 billion. On February 17, 2023, we entered into an agreement to sell a portion of our remaining Eagle Ford assets to INEOS Energy for 1.4 billion. 
 On March 25, 2022, we sold our Powder River Basin assets in Wyoming to Continental Resources, Inc. for approximately 450 million. 
 On March 9, 2022, we completed our acquisition of Chief, Radler and associated non-operated interests held by affiliates of Tug Hill, Inc. Tug Hill ). Chief, Radler and Tug Hill held producing assets and an inventory of premium drilling locations in the Marcellus Shale in Northeast Pennsylvania. 
 On November 1, 2021, we completed our acquisition of Vine, an energy company focused on the development of natural gas properties in stacked Haynesville and Mid-Bossier shale plays in Northwest Louisiana. 
 On June 28, 2020, we and certain of our subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. The Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Plan in a bench ruling on January 13, 2021 and entered the Confirmation Order on January 16, 2021. The Debtors emerged from bankruptcy on February 9, 2021. Upon emergence, all existing equity was canceled and New Common Stock was issued to the previous holders of our FLLO Term Loan Facility, Second Lien Notes, senior unsecured notes and certain general unsecured creditors whose claims were impaired as a result of our bankruptcy, as well as to other parties as set forth in the Plan, including to other parties participating in a 600 million rights offering. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted fresh start accounting, which resulted in us becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements on or after February 9, 2021 are not comparable to the consolidated financial statements prior to that date. To facilitate our discussion in this report, we refer to the post-emergence reorganized company as the Successor and the pre-emergence company as the Predecessor. See Note 2 and Note 3 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further discussion of our bankruptcy, the resulting reorganization and fresh start accounting.

Well Data 
 As of December 31, 2022, we held an interest in approximately 8,400 gross productive wells, including 6,700 wells in which we held a working interest and 1,700 wells in which we held an overriding or royalty interest. Of the 6,700 (4,300 net) wells in which we held a working interest, 3,500 (2,100 net) wells were classified as productive natural gas wells and 3,200 (2,200 net) wells were classified as productive oil wells. During 2022, we operated 6,000 gross wells and held a non-operating working interest in 700 gross wells. We also completed 216 gross (151 net) wells as operator and participated in another 22 gross (1 net) wells completed by other operators. We operate approximately 99 of our current daily production volumes.

 Natural Gas, Oil and NGL Reserves 
 The tables below set forth information as of December 31, 2022, with respect to our estimated proved reserves, the associated estimated future net revenue, the present value of estimated future net revenue and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. None of the estimated future net revenue, PV-10 nor the standardized measure are intended to represent the current market value of the estimated natural gas, oil and NGL reserves we own. All of our estimated reserves are located within the United States.

 (a) Marcellus, Haynesville and Eagle Ford accounted for approximately 51 , 31 , and 18 , respectively, of our estimated proved reserves by volume as of December 31, 2022. 
 (b) Estimated future net revenue represents the estimated future revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net of estimated production and future development costs, using pricing differentials and costs under existing economic conditions as of December 31, 2022, and assuming commodity prices as set forth below. For the purpose of determining prices used in our reserve reports, we used the unweighted arithmetic average of the prices on the first day of each month within the 12-month period ended December 31, 2022. The prices used in our PV-10 measure were 6.36 per mcf of natural gas, 93.67 per bbl of oil and 43.58 per bbl of NGL, before basis differential adjustments. These prices should not be interpreted as a prediction of future prices, nor do they reflect the value of our commodity derivative instruments in place as of December 31, 2022. The amounts shown do not give effect to non-property-related expenses, such as corporate general and administrative expenses and debt service, or to depreciation, depletion and amortization. The present value of estimated future net revenue typically differs from the standardized measure because the former does not include the effects of estimated future income tax expense of 6.4 billion as of December 31, 2022. 
 Management uses PV-10, which is calculated without deducting estimated future income tax expenses, as a measure of the value of the Company's current proved reserves and to compare relative values among peer companies. We also understand that securities analysts and rating agencies use this measure in similar ways. While estimated future net revenue and the present value thereof are based on prices, costs and discount factors which may be consistent from company to company, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company. PV-10, a non-GAAP measure, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows or any other measure of a company's financial or operating performance presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 A comparison of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows to PV-10 is presented above. Neither PV-10 nor the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows purport to represent the fair value of our proved natural gas and oil reserves.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 As of December 31, 2022, our proved reserve estimates included 4,321 Bcfe of reserves classified as proved undeveloped, compared to 3,963 Bcfe as of December 31, 2021. Presented below is a summary of changes in our proved undeveloped reserves for 2022: 
 Total (bcfe) Proved undeveloped reserves, beginning of period 3,963 Extensions and discoveries 51 Revisions of previous estimates 866 Conversion to proved developed reserves (1,099) Purchase of reserves-in-place 552 Sales of reserves-in-place (12) Proved undeveloped reserves, end of period 4,321 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, all PUDs were planned to be developed within five years of original recording. In 2022, we invested approximately 851 million to convert 1,099 bcfe of PUDs to proved developed reserves. We added 51 bcfe of PUD reserves through extensions and discoveries primarily due to new PUDs added to emerging plays. Revisions of previous estimates resulted in a net upward revision of 866 bcfe. The net upward revision primarily resulted from development plan optimization through prioritizing longer laterals and multi-well pad development in Haynesville for 834 bcfe, 146 bcfe of upward revisions to existing PUD forecasts in Marcellus and Haynesville, partially offset by a downward revision of 114 bcfe due to development plan changes in Marcellus and Eagle Ford. We added 552 bcfe of PUDs through purchase of reserves-in-place related to the Marcellus Acquisition. 
 The future net revenue attributable to our estimated PUDs was 18.333 billion and the present value was 10.344 billion as of December 31, 2022. These values were calculated assuming that we will expend approximately 4.3 billion to develop these reserves 1,411 million in 2023, 1,430 million in 2024, 1,184 million in 2025, 165 million in 2026 and 56 million in 2027). The amount and timing of these expenditures will depend on a number of factors, including actual drilling results, service costs, commodity prices and the availability of capital. Our developmental drilling schedules are subject to revision and reprioritization throughout the year resulting from unknowable factors such as commodity prices, unexpected developmental drilling results, title issues and infrastructure availability or constraints. 
 Of our 13,002 bcfe of proved reserves as of December 31, 2022, approximately 190 bcfe, or 1 , were non-producing. 
 Our ownership interest used for calculating proved reserves and the associated estimated future net revenue assumes maximum participation by other parties to our farm-out and participation agreements. 
 Our estimated proved reserves and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of the proved reserves as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, along with the changes in quantities and standardized measure of the reserves for each of the three years then ended, are shown in Supplemental Disclosures About Natural Gas, Oil and NGL Producing Activities included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. No estimates of proved reserves comparable to those included herein have been included in reports to any federal agency other than the SEC. 
 There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond our control. The reserve data represents only estimates. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured exactly, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates made by different engineers often vary. Accordingly, reserve estimates often differ from the actual quantities of natural gas, oil and NGL that are ultimately recovered. Furthermore, the estimated future net revenue from proved reserves and the associated present value are based upon certain assumptions, including prices, future production levels and costs that may not prove correct. Future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of any estimate. See Supplemental Disclosures About Natural Gas,

Acreage 
 The following table sets forth our gross and net developed and undeveloped natural gas and oil leasehold and fee mineral acreage as of December 31, 2022. Gross acres are the total number of acres in which we own a working interest. Net acres refer to gross acres multiplied by our fractional working interest.

 ___________________________________________ 
 (a) Includes 1.2 million net acres retained in the 2016 divestiture of our Devonian Shale assets, in which we retained all rights below the base of the Kope formation. 
 Most of our leases have a three- to five-year primary term, and we manage lease expirations to ensure that we do not experience unintended material expirations. Our leasehold management efforts include scheduling our drilling to establish production in paying quantities in order to hold leases by production, timely exercising our contractual rights to pay delay rentals to extend the terms of leases we value, planning non-core divestitures to high-grade our lease inventory and letting some leases expire that are no longer part of our development plans. We do not anticipate any material lease expirations within the next three years. 

Marketing 
 The principal function of our marketing operations is to provide natural gas, oil and NGL marketing services, including commodity price structuring, securing and negotiating of gathering, hauling, processing and transportation services, contract administration and nomination services for us and other interest owners in Chesapeake-operated wells. The marketing operations also provide other services for our exploration and production activities, including services to enhance the value of natural gas and oil production by aggregating volumes sold to various intermediary markets, end markets and pipelines. This aggregation allows us to attract larger, more creditworthy customers that in turn assist in maximizing the prices received. 
 Generally, our natural gas and NGL production are sold to purchasers under percentage-of-index contracts, spot price contracts or percentage-of-proceeds contracts. Under our percentage-of-index contracts, the price we receive is tied to published indices. Under the terms of our percentage-of-proceeds contracts, we receive a percentage of the resale price received from the ultimate purchaser. Oil production is sold under short-to-long term market-sensitive and spot price contracts. 
 We have entered into long-term gathering, processing, and transportation contracts with various parties that require us to deliver fixed, determinable quantities of production over specified periods of time. Certain of our contracts require us to make payments for any shortfalls in delivering or transporting minimum volumes under these commitments. See Note 7 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further discussion of commitments. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had delivery commitments for a total of approximately 3,400 bcf over the next 10 years. These delivery commitments vary each year, and we expect to primarily fulfill these commitments with production from our proved developed reserves.

No other purchasers accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues during the 2022 Successor Period, 2021 Successor Period, 2021 Predecessor Period or 2020 Predecessor Period. 

Competition 
 We compete with both major integrated and other independent natural gas and oil companies in all aspects of our business to explore, develop and operate our properties and market our production. Some of our competitors may have larger financial and other resources than us. Competitive conditions may be affected by future legislation and regulations as the United States develops new energy and climate-related policies. In addition, some of our competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for natural gas and oil production, such as changing prices, domestic and foreign political conditions, weather conditions, the price and availability of alternative fuels, the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities and overall economic conditions. We also face indirect competition from alternative energy sources, including wind, solar and electric power. We believe that our technological expertise, combined with our exploration, land, drilling and production capabilities and the experience of our management team, enables us to compete effectively. 

Public Policy and Government Regulation 
 All of our operations are conducted onshore in the United States. Our industry is subject to a wide range of regulations, laws, rules, taxes, fees and other policy implementation actions that have been pervasive and are under constant review for amendment or expansion. Numerous government agencies have issued extensive regulations that are binding on our industry, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. These laws and regulations increase the cost of doing business and consequently affect profitability. Additionally, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered. We actively monitor regulatory developments applicable to our industry in order to anticipate, design and implement required compliance activities and systems. The following are significant areas of government control and regulation affecting our operations. 
 Exploration and Production, Environmental, Health and Safety and Occupational Laws and Regulations 
 Our operations are subject to federal, tribal, state, and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations relate to matters that include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 reporting of workplace injuries and illnesses; 
 industrial hygiene monitoring; 
 worker protection and workplace safety; 
 approval or permits to drill and to conduct operations; 
 provision of financial assurances (such as bonds) covering drilling and well operations; 
 calculation and disbursement of royalty payments and production taxes; 
 seismic operations/data; 
 location, drilling, cementing and casing of wells;

 Shortly after taking office in January 2021, President Biden issued a series of executive orders designed to address climate change and requiring agencies to review environmental actions taken by the Trump administration, as well as a memorandum to departments and agencies to refrain from proposing or issuing rules until a departmental or agency head appointed or designated by the Biden administration has reviewed and approved the rule. In November 2021, the Biden Administration released The Long-Term Strategy of the United States: Pathways to Net-Zero Greenhouse Gas Emissions by 2050, which establishes a roadmap to net zero emissions in the United States by 2050 through, among other things, improving energy efficiency; decarbonizing energy sources via electricity, hydrogen, and sustainable biofuels; and reducing non-carbon dioxide GHG emissions, such as methane and nitrous oxide. Shortly thereafter, in November 2021, the Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA proposed new regulations to establish comprehensive standards of performance and emission guidelines for methane and volatile organic compound emissions from existing operations in the oil and gas sector, including the exploration and production, transmission, processing, and storage segments. The EPA issued a supplemental proposed rule in November 2022 to update, strengthen and expand its November 2021 proposed rule. The supplemental proposed rule would impose more stringent requirements on the natural gas and oil industry. These executive orders and policy priorities may result in the development of additional regulations or changes to existing regulations, certain of which could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the United States is one of almost 200 nations that, in December 2015, agreed to the Paris Agreement, an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will take to achieve its GHG emissions targets. President Biden has recommitted the United States to the Paris Agreement and, in April 2021, announced a goal of reducing the United States emissions by 50-52 below 2005 levels by 2030. Although the national commitments in the Paris Agreement create no binding requirements on individual companies or facilities, they do provide indications of the current administration s policy direction and the types of legislative and regulatory requirements such as the EPA s proposed methane rules that may be needed to achieve those commitments. In November 2021, the international community gathered again in Glasgow at the 26th Conference to the Parties on the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change COP26 ), during which multiple announcements were made, including a call for parties to eliminate certain fossil fuel subsidies and pursue further action on non-carbon dioxide GHGs. Relatedly, the United States and European Union jointly announced the launch of the Global Methane Pledge, which aims to cut global methane pollution at least 30 by 2030 relative to 2020 levels, including all feasible reductions in the energy sector. Shortly thereafter, in August 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA into law, which, among other things, includes a methane emissions reduction program that amends the Clean Air Act to include a Methane Emissions and Waste Reduction Incentive Program for petroleum and natural gas systems. This program requires the EPA to impose a waste emissions charge on certain natural gas and oil sources that are already required to report under EPA s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. Such or similar legislation, regulations and initiatives could affect our business and our results of operation by increasing operating and compliance costs.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 In addition, several states and geographic regions in the United States have also adopted legislation and regulations regarding climate change-related matters, and additional legislation or regulation by these states and regions, U.S. federal agencies, including the EPA, and/or international agreements to which the United States may become a party could result in increased compliance costs for us and our customers. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can lead to the imposition of remedial liabilities, administrative, civil or criminal fines or penalties or injunctions limiting our operations in affected areas. Moreover, multiple environmental laws provide for citizen suits which allow environmental organizations to act in the place of the government and sue operators for alleged violations of environmental law. We consider the responsibility and costs of environmental protection and safety and health compliance fundamental, manageable parts of our business. To date, we have been able to plan for and comply with environmental, safety and health laws and regulations without materially altering our operating strategy or incurring significant unreimbursed expenditures. However, based on regulatory trends and increasingly stringent laws, as well as the increasing number of climate-related commitments by capital providers, our capital expenditures and operating expenses related to the protection of the environment and safety and health compliance have increased over the years and may continue to increase. For example, in addition to regulations from the EPA and similar agencies, the SEC has issued proposed rules that would mandate extensive disclosure of climate-related risks and other information. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which can change and could adversely impact our business. The SEC has also indicated plans to propose various other disclosure regulations, including regarding human capital and other ESG matters. We cannot predict with any reasonable degree of certainty our future exposure concerning such matters. 
 Our operations also are subject to conservation regulations, including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit, the rate of production allowable from gas and oil wells, and the unitization or pooling of gas and oil properties. In the United States, some states allow the statutory pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration, while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases, which may make it more difficult to develop gas and oil properties. In addition, federal and state conservation laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and state conservation laws impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production. These regulations limit the amounts of gas and oil we can produce from our wells and the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. For further discussion, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which can change and could adversely impact our business. 
 Regulatory proposals in some states and local communities have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations. Federal and state agencies have continued to assess the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing, which could spur further action toward federal, state and/or local legislation and regulation. Further restrictions of hydraulic fracturing could make it difficult or impossible to conduct our drilling and completion operations, and thereby reduce the amount of natural gas, oil and NGL that we are ultimately able to produce from our properties. 
 Certain of our U.S. natural gas and oil leases are granted or approved by the federal government and administered the U.S. Department of the Interior. Such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders that regulate, among other matters, drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government, tribes or tribal members. The federal government has increased its review in recent years in evaluating and, in some cases, promulgating new rules and regulations regarding competitive lease bidding, venting and flaring, gas and oil measurement and royalty payment obligations for production from federal lands. On January 27, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order indefinitely suspending new natural gas and oil leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal gas and oil permitting and leasing practices. The federal district court in Louisiana issued a permanent injunction against the executive order on August 18, 2022, limited to the thirteen plaintiff states, Louisiana, Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia. In response to the January 27, 2021 executive order, the U.S. Department of the Interior released its Report On The Federal Oil And Gas Leasing Program in November 2021, which assessed the current state of gas and oil leasing on federal lands and proposed several reforms, including raising royalty rates and implementing stricter standards for entities seeking to purchase gas and oil leases. On November 30, 2022, the BLM issued a proposed rule to reduce the release of methane from venting, flaring, and leaks during gas and oil production activities on Federal and Indian leases, exemplifying the Biden Administration s increased focus on the climate change impacts of federal projects, which could result in further changes to the federal gas and oil leasing program in the future. Restrictions surrounding onshore drilling, onshore

 federal lease availability, and restrictions on the ability to obtain required permits could have a material adverse impact on our operations. 
 Permitting activities on federal lands are also subject to frequent delays. Delays in obtaining permits or an inability to obtain new permits or permit renewals could inhibit our ability to execute our drilling and production plans. Failure to comply with applicable regulations or permit requirements could result in revocation of our permits, inability to obtain new permits and the imposition of fines and penalties. 
 For further discussion, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Natural gas and oil operations are uncertain and involve substantial costs and risks. 

Title to Properties 
 Our title to properties is subject to royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits, working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the natural gas and oil industry, to liens for current taxes not yet due and to other encumbrances. As is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties, only cursory investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition. Drilling title opinions are usually prepared before commencement of drilling operations. We believe we have satisfactory title to substantially all of our active properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the natural gas and oil industry. Nevertheless, we are involved in title disputes from time to time that may result in litigation. 

Operating Hazards and Insurance 
 The natural gas and oil business involves a variety of operating risks, including the risk of fire, explosions, blow-outs, pipe failure, abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, ruptures or discharges of toxic gases. If any of these should occur, we could incur legal defense costs and could suffer substantial losses due to injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties, and suspension of operations. Our horizontal and deep drilling activities involve greater risk of mechanical problems than vertical and shallow drilling operations. 
 We maintain a control of well insurance policy with a 50 million single well limit and a 100 million multiple wells limit that insures against certain sudden and accidental risks associated with drilling, completing and operating our wells. This insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or exposure to liability. We also carry a 300 million comprehensive general liability umbrella insurance policy. In addition, we maintain a 50 million pollution liability insurance policy providing coverage for gradual pollution related risks and in excess of the general liability policy for sudden and accidental pollution risks. We provide workers' compensation insurance coverage to employees in all states in which we operate. While we believe these policies are customary in the industry, they do not provide complete coverage against all operating risks, and policy limits scale to our working interest percentage in certain situations. In addition, our insurance does not cover penalties or fines that may be assessed by a governmental authority. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover every claim made against us or may not be commercially available for purchase in the future.

 Human Capital Resources 
 One Team. One Chesapeake. 
 Our One CHK culture and company core values promote an inclusive, diverse and productive workplace. Working as One CHK defines Chesapeake s culture and unites our team to achieve shared goals for the benefit of our stakeholders. It is a culture of accountability where innovation, collaboration and calculated risk-taking help us achieve sustainable operational success. We had approximately 1,200 employees as of December 31, 2022. None of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements, and our management works to maintain good relations with our employees. 
 Our Culture, Our Core Values 
 At Chesapeake, our employees are driven to create value every day in a safe and responsible manner. Our core values are the foundation of our culture and the driving force behind our goal to achieve ESG excellence. Serving as the lens through which we evaluate every business decision, our commitment to these values, in both words and actions builds a stronger, healthier Chesapeake, benefiting all our stakeholders. Our core values are: 
 Integrity and Trust 
 Respect 
 Transparency and Open Communication 
 Commercial Focus 
 Change Leadership 
 Celebrating Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 We are committed to inclusion and diversity. Building a diverse workforce and equitable and inclusive work culture is an important factor in contributing to Chesapeake s sustainable success. We proactively embrace our diversity of people, thoughts and talents, and combine these strengths to pursue results and meaningful change for our company, employees and stakeholders, and we provide education and training for our employees on topics related to inclusion and diversity. 
 In 2019, Chesapeake joined a coalition of companies pledging to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. On February 9, 2021, we formed a board committee dedicated to ESG oversight, including our inclusion and diversity efforts. Two of the seven members of our Board of Directors are considered diverse, including one female and one underrepresented minority (as defined in Nasdaq s newly enacted listing rule). Chesapeake cultivates a workplace in which diverse perspectives are welcomed and respected and where employees feel encouraged to discuss diversity and inclusion. 
 In 2022, we further advanced our DEI program by nominating an executive sponsor from the Company s senior management team, along with our inaugural advisory board and council teams. Each of these branches of our DEI program take part in determining strategic priorities, advancing our culture and supporting internal activities that invite all employees to participate in achieving our DEI vision. 
 Stay Accident Free Everyday (S.A.F.E.) 
 Safety is more than a company metric, it is core to our commitment to leading a responsible energy future. We set and deliver robust safety standards, prioritizing the well-being of our employees and contractors. Our safety culture is championed by our Board of Directors and executive leadership team, owned by every employee and contractor and managed by our Health, Safety, Environmental and Regulatory (HSER) team. Maintaining a safe work environment and promoting safe behaviors is a commitment that each of our employees and contractors own together. We hold each other accountable to keeping our sites, our co-workers and our contractors safe. 
 One program that reinforces this philosophy of personal responsibility is Stop Work Authority. Through Stop Work Authority, every employee and contractor has the right, responsibility and authority to stop work if conditions are unsafe or could cause harm to the environment. Creating an incident-free work environment starts with setting clear expectations among employees and contractors regarding our safety standards, and working to empower and equip individuals with the skills necessary to promote safety in their areas of work. The foundation of our safety

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 training efforts is our Stay Accident Free Every Day (S.A.F.E.) program, which encourages all workers on our locations to take personal responsibility for their safety and the safety of those around them. This behavior-based program addresses the activities that can often lead to safety incidents and encourages actions that create safe work sites and a safe corporate campus. 
 Every year our HSER team provides targeted trainings based on safety performance analysis, job functions and location specific factors. Our training program includes a mix of in-person and virtual training, with greater emphasis on in-person instruction and includes all employees. Job-specific learning paths aim to exceed regulatory requirements and ensure employees are holistically prepared to execute their job functions safely and responsibly. 
 
 Chesapeake s training philosophy values contractor training in the same manner as employees. We design contractor training to align as much as possible with employee training, encouraging synchronized knowledge sharing and understanding, critical to decreasing our cumulative incidents. 
 Ethical Business Conduct 
 Chesapeake works hard to maintain the confidence of our stakeholders. We earn this trust by acting in an ethical manner to protect our people, the environment and the communities where we operate. This starts by driving accountability through all levels of the company and having systems in place to uphold our high standards for conduct. Strong governance practices begin at the top providing our organization with clear guidelines to define standards for ethical behavior at every level. Each Chesapeake director or employee, regardless of position, must abide by Chesapeake s Code of Business Conduct (the "Code"), which is structured around our core values. Each year all employees must sign a Code certification confirming they have reviewed the Code and related policies, understand the high standards expected of them and will report actual or potential ethics concerns or Code violations. 
 Employee Wellness and Benefits 
 Supporting the individual well-being of our employees is foundational to our safety culture and success as a company. We champion healthy lifestyles and offer health resources. Across the company, employees are offered preventive programs and are encouraged to complete an annual screening for common health-related issues. We support our employees and their families health by offering full medical, dental, vision, prescription drug insurance for employees and their families, life insurance, short- and long-term disability coverage, and health savings and dependent care flexible spending accounts. We offer parental leave for the birth or adoption of a child, an adoption assistance program, alternate work schedules, a 401(k) savings plan with company match and discretionary contributions, flexible work hours, generous paid time off and 12 company-paid holidays, tuition reimbursement and access to a child development center and fitness center at market rates. Additionally, Chesapeake provides employees and their families access to a confidential Employee Assistance Program (EAP) which connects employees with trained counselors and other support professionals.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There are numerous factors that affect our business and results of operations, many of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of factors that we consider to be material and that might cause our future results to differ materially from those currently expected. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows, reserves and/or our ability to pay our debts and other liabilities could suffer, the trading price and liquidity of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in our securities. 
 Risks Related to Operating our Business 
 Conservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for natural gas and oil. 
 Fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to natural gas and oil, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for natural gas and oil. The impact of the changing demand for natural gas and oil could adversely impact our earnings, cash flows and financial position. 
 Negative public perception regarding us or our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations. 
 Negative public perception regarding us or our industry resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing, waste disposal, oil spills, seismic activity, climate change, explosions of natural gas transmission lines and the development and operation of pipelines and other midstream facilities may lead to generally increased political pressure and regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines and enforcement interpretations. Additionally, environmental groups, landowners, local groups and other advocates may oppose our operations through organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage our operations or those of our midstream transportation providers, encourage capital providers to divest of their interests in us or our industry, intervene in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our assets or those of our midstream transportation providers, or file lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt or delay the development or operation of our assets and business or those of our midstream transportation providers. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation, as well as potentially reducing our ability to execute routine or strategic business partnerships. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits we require to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business. A change in control of national, state or local governments, including the U.S. presidential administration, Congress, state or local governments, and governments of other countries may also result in uncertainty regarding the degree to which there will be increased restrictions on natural gas and oil production activities, which could materially adversely affect our industry and our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital have also elected to restrict or eliminate their investment in certain fossil fuel-related activities. For example, many large financial institutions have announced commitments to reduce the emissions associated with their financing activities, such as through the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero GFANZ ), whose members represent over 130 trillion in capital subject to a goal of net zero financed emissions by 2050. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult or costly for us to secure funding for exploration and production activities. Members of the investment community have also begun to screen companies such as ours for sustainability performance, including practices related to GHGs and climate change, before investing in our common stock or providing financing. Any efforts to improve our sustainability practices in response to these pressures may increase our costs, regardless of whether such efforts are successful, and we may be forced to implement technologies that are less economically efficient or are not economically viable in order to improve our sustainability performance and to meet the specific requirements to perform services for certain customers. For more information, see our risk factor Increasing attention to ESG matters and our ability to achieve and maintain ESG certifications, goals and commitments may impact our business, financial results or stock price.

 Risks related to potential acquisitions or dispositions may adversely affect our business. 
 From time to time, we evaluate acquisitions and dispositions of assets, businesses and other investments. These transactions may not result in the anticipated benefits or efficiencies. In addition, acquisitions may be financed by borrowings, requiring us to incur more debt, or by the issuance of our common stock. Any such acquisition or disposition involves risks and we cannot assure you that: 
 any acquisition will be successfully integrated into our operations and internal controls; 
 the due diligence conducted prior to an acquisition will uncover situations that could result in financial or legal exposure, such as title defects and potential environmental and other liabilities; 
 post-closing purchase price adjustments will be realized in our favor; 
 our assumptions about, among other things, reserves, estimated production, revenues, capital expenditures, operating expenses and costs will be accurate; 
 there will not be delays in closing, lower than expected sales proceeds for the disposed assets or business, residual liabilities, or post-closing claims for indemnification; 
 any investment, acquisition, or disposition will not divert management resources from the operation of our business; and 
 any investment, acquisition, or disposition will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or reserves. 
 If any of these risks materialize, the benefits of such acquisition or disposition may not be fully realized, if at all, and our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reserves could be negatively impacted. 
 The gas and oil exploration and production industry is very competitive; some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, and there is competition to attract and retain talent and competition over access to certain industry equipment. 
 We face competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to, buying and selling reserves and leases, obtaining goods and services needed to operate our business and marketing natural gas, oil or NGL. Competitors include multinational oil companies, independent production companies and individual producers and operators. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to address industry challenges more effectively or weather industry downturns more easily than we can. We also face indirect competition from alternative energy sources, including wind, solar and electric power. 
 Our performance depends largely on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals and on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense. If we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining skilled employees and managerial talent, our ability to compete effectively may be diminished. We also compete for the equipment required to explore, develop and operate properties. Typically, during times of rising commodity prices, drilling and operating costs will also increase. During these periods, there is often a shortage of drilling rigs and other oilfield equipment and services, which could adversely affect our ability to execute our development plans on a timely basis and within budget. 
 Natural gas, oil and NGL prices fluctuate widely, and lower prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Our revenues, results of operations, profitability, liquidity, leverage ratio and ability to grow and invest in capital expenditures depend primarily upon the prices we receive for the natural gas, oil and NGL we sell. We incur substantial expenditures to replace reserves, sustain production and fund our business plans. Low natural gas, oil and NGL prices can negatively affect the amount of cash available for capital expenditures, debt service and debt repayment and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reserves. In addition, periods of low natural gas and oil prices may result in a reduction of the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties due to recognizing impairments in proved and unproved properties. 
 27 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Volatility in natural gas, oil and NGL prices may result from factors that are beyond our control, including: 
 domestic and worldwide supplies of natural gas, oil and NGL, including U.S. inventories of natural gas and oil reserves; 
 weather conditions; 
 changes in the level of consumer and industrial demand, including impacts from global or national health epidemics and concerns, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; 
 the price and availability of alternative fuels; 
 technological advances affecting energy consumption; 
 the effectiveness of worldwide conservation measures; 
 the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, other transportation facilities and processing facilities; 
 the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets, including by commodity price speculators and others; 
 U.S. exports of natural gas, oil, liquefied natural gas and NGL; 
 the price and level of foreign imports; 
 the nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; 
 the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and others to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls; 
 increased use of competing energy products, including alternative energy sources; 
 political instability or armed conflict in natural gas and oil producing regions, including in connection with the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine; 
 acts of terrorism; and 
 domestic and global economic and political conditions. 
 These factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future natural gas, oil and NGL price movements. In addition, any prolonged period of lower prices could reduce the quantities of reserves that we may economically produce. 
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related economic turmoil, including supply chain constraints, have affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 The global spread of COVID-19 created significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption, including supply chain constraints, commencing in 2020, and threatens to continue to do so in 2023. The pandemic has adversely impacted the entire global economy, and there is considerable uncertainty regarding how long the pandemic and related market conditions will persist and the extent and duration of governmental and other measures implemented to try to slow the spread of the virus, such as quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business and government shutdowns and restrictions on operations. Our precautionary measures and plans may not be effective in preventing future disruptions to our business. Moreover, future operations could be negatively affected if a significant number of our employees are quarantined as a result of exposure to the virus. In addition, actions by our customers and derivative contract counterparties in response to COVID-19 and its economic impacts, including potential non-performance or delays, may also have an adverse impact on our business. 
 Natural gas and oil prices are expected to continue to be volatile as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other geopolitical factors, and as changes in natural gas and oil inventories, industry demand and national and economic performance are reported, and we cannot predict when prices will improve and stabilize. Due to numerous uncertainties, we cannot at this time predict the full impact that COVID-19 or the significant disruption and volatility currently being experienced in the natural gas and oil markets will have on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 If commodity prices fall or drilling efforts are unsuccessful, we may be required to record write downs of the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties. 
 We have been required to write down the carrying value of certain of our natural gas and oil properties in the past, and there is a risk that we will be required to take additional writedowns in the future. Writedowns may occur in the future when natural gas and oil prices are low, or if we have downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, increases in our estimates of operating or development costs, or due to the anticipated sale of properties. 
 The successful efforts method of accounting requires that we periodically review the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties for possible impairment. Impairment is recognized for the excess of book value over fair value when the book value of a proven property is greater than the expected undiscounted future net cash flows from that property and on acreage when conditions indicate the carrying value is not recoverable. We may be required to write down the carrying value of a property based on natural gas and oil prices at the time of the impairment review, or as a result of continuing evaluation of drilling results, production data, economics, divestiture activity, and other factors. A writedown constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings and does not impact cash or cash flows from operating activities; however, it reflects our long-term ability to recover an investment, reduces our reported earnings and increases certain leverage ratios. See Impairments within Critical Accounting Estimates included in Item 7 of this report for further information. 
 Significant capital expenditures are required to replace our reserves and conduct our business. 
 Our exploration, development and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures. We intend to fund our capital expenditures through cash flows from operations, and to the extent that is not sufficient, borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our ability to generate operating cash flow is subject to a number of risks and variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, prices of natural gas, oil and NGL, our success in developing and producing new reserves and the other risk factors discussed herein. Our forecasted 2023 capital expenditures, inclusive of capitalized interest, are 1.765 - 1.835 billion compared to our 2022 capital spending level of 1.9 billion. Management continues to review operational plans for 2023 and beyond, which could result in changes to projected capital expenditures and projected revenues from sales of natural gas, oil and NGL. If we are unable to fund our capital expenditures as planned, we could experience a curtailment of our exploration and development activity, a loss of properties and a decline in our natural gas, oil and NGL reserves. 
 If we are not able to replace reserves, we may not be able to sustain production. 
 Our future success depends largely upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable. Unless we replace the reserves we produce through successful development, exploration or acquisition activities, our proved reserves and production will decline over time. Thus, our future natural gas and oil reserves and production, and therefore our cash flows and income, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. 
 The actual quantities of and future net revenues from our proved reserves may be less than our estimates. 
 The estimates of our proved reserves and the estimated future net revenues from our proved reserves included in this report are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to natural gas, oil and NGL prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The process of estimating natural gas, oil and NGL reserves is complex and involves significant decisions and assumptions associated with geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each well. Therefore, these estimates are subject to future revisions. 
 Actual future production, natural gas, oil and NGL prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas, oil and NGL reserves most likely will vary from these estimates. Such variations may be significant and could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our proved reserves. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development drilling, prevailing natural gas and oil prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 As of December 31, 2022, approximately 33 of our estimated proved reserves (by volume) were undeveloped. These reserve estimates reflect our plans for capital expenditures to convert PUDs into proved developed reserves, including approximately 4.3 billion during the next five years. You should be aware that the estimated development costs may not equal our actual costs, development may not occur as scheduled and results may not be as estimated. If we choose not to develop our PUDs, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop them, we will be required to remove them from our reported proved reserves. In addition, under the SEC's reserve reporting rules, because PUDs generally may be booked only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking, we may be required to remove any PUDs that are not developed within this five-year time frame. 
 You should not assume that the present values included in this report represent the current market value of our estimated reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the estimates of our present values are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimates. The price on the date of estimate is calculated as the average natural gas and oil price during the 12 months ending in the current reporting period, determined as the unweighted arithmetic average of prices on the first day of each month within the 12-month period. The December 31, 2022 present value is based on prices of 6.36 per mcf of natural gas, 93.67 per bbl of oil and 43.58 per bbl of NGL, before basis differential adjustments. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of an estimate. 
 The timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of natural gas and oil properties will affect both the timing of future net cash flows from our proved reserves and their present value. Any changes in demand for natural gas and oil, governmental regulations or taxation will also affect the future net cash flows from our production. In addition, the 10 discount factor that is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor. Interest rates in effect from time to time and the risks associated with our business or the gas and oil industry in general will affect the appropriateness of the 10 discount factor. 
 Our development and exploratory drilling efforts and our well operations may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns. 
 We have a substantial inventory of undeveloped properties. Development and exploratory drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that commercially productive reservoirs will not be discovered. We have acquired undeveloped properties that we believe will enhance our growth potential and increase our earnings over time. However, we cannot assure you that all prospects will be economically viable or that we will not abandon our initial investments. Additionally, there can be no assurance that undeveloped properties acquired by us will be profitably developed, that new wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive, or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such undeveloped properties or wells. 
 Drilling for natural gas and oil may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient commercial quantities to cover the drilling, operating and other costs. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and many factors can adversely affect the economics of a well or property. Drilling and completion operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of unexpected drilling conditions, title problems, equipment failures or accidents, shortages of midstream transportation, equipment or personnel, environmental issues, state or local bans or moratoriums on hydraulic fracturing and produced water disposal, federal restrictions on gas and oil leasing and permitting, and a decline in commodity prices, among others. The profitability of wells, particularly in certain of the areas in which we operate, will be reduced or eliminated if commodity prices decline. In addition, wells that are profitable may not meet our internal return targets, which are dependent upon the current and future market prices for natural gas, oil and NGL, costs associated with producing natural gas, oil and NGL and our ability to add reserves at an acceptable cost. 
 We rely to a significant extent on seismic data and other technologies in evaluating undeveloped properties and in conducting our exploration activities. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively, prior to acquisition of undeveloped properties, or drilling a well, whether natural gas or oil is present or may be produced economically. If we incur significant expense in acquiring or developing properties that do not produce as expected or at profitable levels, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Certain of our undeveloped properties are subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage or the leases are renewed. 
 Leases on natural gas and oil properties typically have a term of three to five years, after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, a well is drilled and production of hydrocarbons in paying quantities is established. If our leases on our undeveloped properties expire and we are unable to renew the leases, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. Although we seek to actively manage our undeveloped properties, our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, natural gas and oil prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. Low commodity prices may cause us to delay our drilling plans and, as a result, lose our right to develop the related properties. 
 Our commodity price risk management activities may limit the benefit we would receive from increases in commodity prices, may require us to provide collateral for derivative liabilities and involve risk that our counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us. 
 To manage our exposure to price volatility, we enter into natural gas, oil and NGL price derivative contracts. Our natural gas, oil and NGL derivative arrangements may limit the benefit we would receive from increases in commodity prices. The fair value of our natural gas, oil and NGL derivative instruments can fluctuate significantly between periods. Our decision to mitigate cash flow volatility through derivative arrangements, if any, is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions and our desire to stabilize cash flows necessary for the development of our proved reserves. We may choose not to enter into derivatives if we believe the pricing environment for certain time periods is unfavorable. Additionally, we may choose to liquidate existing derivative positions prior to the expiration of their contractual maturities to monetize gain positions for the purpose of funding our capital program. 
 Most of our natural gas, oil and NGL derivative contracts are with counterparties under bilateral hedging arrangements. Under a majority of our arrangements, the collateral provided for our obligations is secured by the same hydrocarbon interests that secure our New Credit Facility. Our counterparties obligations under the arrangements must be secured by cash or letters of credit to the extent that any mark-to-market amounts owed to us exceed defined thresholds. Collateral requirements are dependent to a large extent on natural gas and oil prices. 
 Natural gas, oil and NGL derivative transactions expose us to the risk that our counterparties, which are generally financial institutions, may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us. During periods of declining commodity prices, the value of our commodity derivative asset positions increase, which increases our counterparty exposure. Although the counterparties to our hedging arrangements are required to secure their obligations to us under certain scenarios, if any of our counterparties were to default on their obligations to us under the derivative contracts or seek bankruptcy protection, it could have an adverse effect on our ability to fund our planned activities and could result in a larger percentage of our future cash flows being exposed to commodity price changes. 
 Natural gas and oil operations are uncertain and involve substantial costs and risks. 
 Our operating activities are subject to numerous costs and risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive gas or oil reservoirs. Drilling for natural gas, oil and NGL can be unprofitable, not only from dry holes, but from productive wells that do not return a profit because of insufficient revenue from production or high costs. Substantial costs are required to locate, acquire and develop gas and oil properties, and we are often uncertain as to the amount and timing of those costs. Our cost of drilling, completing, equipping and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences. Declines in commodity prices and overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomic or less economic than forecasted. Although both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. In addition, our gas and oil properties can become damaged, our operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled and the costs of such operations may increase as a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: 
 unexpected drilling conditions, pressure conditions or irregularities in reservoir formations; 
 equipment failures or accidents; 
 fires, explosions, blowouts, cratering or loss of well control; 
 the mishandling or underground migration of fluids and chemicals; 
 31 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes and extreme temperatures; 
 issues with title or in receiving governmental permits or approvals; 
 restricted takeaway capacity for our production, including due to inadequate midstream infrastructure or constrained downstream markets; 
 environmental hazards or liabilities; 
 restrictions in access to, or disposal of, water used or produced in drilling and completion operations; 
 shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment; and 
 unexpected or unforeseen changes in regulatory policy, and political or public opinion. 
 The occurrence of one or more of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property, as well as significant liabilities. Although we may maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks described above, our insurance may not be adequate to cover casualty losses or liabilities, and our insurance does not cover penalties or fines that may be assessed by a governmental authority. For certain risks, such as political risk, business interruption, war, terrorism and piracy, we have limited or no insurance coverage. Also, in the future we may not be able to obtain insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase. The occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured may expose us to liabilities. 
 Moreover, certain of these events could result in environmental pollution and impact to third parties, including persons living in proximity to our operations, our employees and employees of our contractors, leading to possible injuries, death or significant damage to property and natural resources. 
 Our ability to produce natural gas, oil and NGL economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner. 
 
 Development activities, particularly hydraulic fracturing, require the use and disposal of significant quantities of water. In certain areas, there may be insufficient local aquifer capacity to provide a source of water for drilling activities. Water must be obtained from other sources and transported to the drilling site. Our inability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations, could adversely impact our operations in certain areas. The imposition of environmental initiatives and regulations could further restrict our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other materials associated with the exploration, development or production of natural gas and oil. 
 Our operations may be adversely affected by pipeline, trucking and gathering system capacity constraints and may be subject to interruptions that could adversely affect our cash flow. 
 In certain resource plays, the capacity of gathering and transportation systems is insufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells. We rely heavily on third parties to meet our natural gas, oil and NGL gathering needs. Capital constraints could limit the construction of new pipelines and gathering systems and the provision or expansion of trucking services by third parties. Until this new capacity is available, we may experience delays in producing and selling our natural gas, oil and NGL. In such event, we might have to shut in our wells while awaiting a pipeline connection or additional capacity, which would adversely affect our results of operations. 
 A portion of our natural gas, oil and NGL production in any region may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for numerous reasons, including weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. If a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could materially adversely affect our cash flow.

 Cyber-attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used by the gas and oil industry and related regulations may adversely impact our operations and, if we or our third-party providers are unable to obtain and maintain adequate protection for our key systems and data, our business may be harmed. 
 Our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development and production activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of natural gas, oil and NGL reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, and communicate with our customers, employees and third-party partners. In addition, many third-party providers, such as vendors and others in the supply chain, directly or indirectly provide to us various products and services across an array of internal and external functions that enable us to conduct, monitor and/or protect our business, systems and data assets. In addition, in the ordinary course, we and our service providers collect, process, transmit, and store proprietary and confidential data, including personal information. 
 We have been the subject of cyber-attacks on our internal systems and through those of third parties in the past. As an energy company, we expect to continue to be a target for such attacks in the future from nation-state sponsored foreign actors and other attackers. We are vulnerable to malicious attacks by third parties or insiders, social engineering and human error, as well as to bugs and other vulnerabilities that may exist in our or our third-party providers systems or technologies. Unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information, customer or employee data or other proprietary or commercially sensitive information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, or other disruptions in our exploration or production operations or planned business transactions, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. If our information technology systems cease to function properly or our cybersecurity is breached (for example, due to ransomware), we could suffer disruptions to our normal operations, which may include disruptions to our drilling, completion, production and corporate functions. A cyber-attack, or the perception thereof, involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business associates or third-party providers, could result in supply chain disruptions that delay or prevent the transportation and marketing of our production, non-compliance leading to regulatory fines or penalties, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our or any of our customer s or supplier s data or confidential information that could harm our business by damaging our reputation, subjecting us to potential financial or legal liability, and requiring us to incur significant costs, including costs to repair or restore our systems and data or to take other remedial steps. 
 Both the frequency and magnitude of cyberattacks is expected to increase and attackers are becoming more sophisticated. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate, detect, prevent, or contain future attacks, particularly as the methodologies utilized by attackers change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and we may be unable to investigate or remediate incidents because attackers are increasingly using techniques and tools designed to circumvent controls, to avoid detection, and to remove or obfuscate forensic evidence. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased our exposure to potential cybersecurity breaches as a result of global remote working dynamics for our customers, employees and third-party providers that present additional risk that threat actors may seek to engage in social engineering (for example, phishing) and to exploit vulnerabilities in corporate and non-corporate networks. As cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to spend significant additional resources to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks. In addition, new laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate costs as we collect and store personal data related to employees, royalty owners and other parties. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties and legal liability. For example, we are subject to various state privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA ), which came into effect in January, 2020, and the California Privacy Rights Act CPRA ), which expands upon the CCPA and came into effect in January 2023 (with a lookback period until January 2022). The CCPA and the CPRA, among other things, contain new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about California residents and enhanced consumer protections for those individuals, and provide for statutory fines and penalties for certain data security breaches or other CCPA and CPRA violations. At least fifteen other states have considered, and some have already enacted, privacy laws like the CCPA and the CPRA. 
 Any losses, costs or liabilities directly or indirectly related to cyberattacks or similar incidents may not be covered by, or may exceed the coverage limits of, any or all of our insurance policies.

 Our operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond our control . 
 
 Our operations are subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond our control, including risks from extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, severe storms, floods, droughts, heat waves, winter storms, and ambient temperature or precipitation changes, as well as wildfires, war, accidents, civil unrest, political events, earthquakes, system failures, cyber threats, terrorist acts and epidemic or pandemic diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, any of which could result in suspension of operations (including those of our customers or suppliers) or harm to people, our assets or the natural environment. 
 It is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events or how such frequency or severity may change. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Moreover, any changes in ambient temperatures may impact demand for natural gas if it results in lower energy needs for, among other things, temperature control. While concerns over energy security have, in some situations, seen increased demand for natural gas, sustained concerns over energy security may result in an accelerated adoption of renewable energy and other alternative energy generation or storage, or energy efficiency, technologies. Any such accelerated adoption of alternative energy sources or energy efficiency improvements may decrease demand for our products or otherwise adversely impact our business or results of operations. 
 In addition, our headquarters are located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, an area that experiences severe weather events, including tornadoes and earthquakes. Our information systems and administrative and management processes are primarily provided to our various drilling projects and producing wells throughout the United States from this location, which could be disrupted if a catastrophic event, such as a tornado, power outage or act of terror, destroyed or severely damaged our headquarters. Any such catastrophic event could harm our ability to conduct normal operations and could adversely affect our business. 
 A deterioration in general economic, political, business or industry conditions would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. 
 Historically, concerns about global economic growth and international political stability have had a significant impact on global financial markets and commodity prices, including petroleum products. If the economic or political climate in the United States or abroad deteriorates, worldwide demand for petroleum products could diminish, which could impact the price at which we can sell our production, affect the ability of our vendors, suppliers and customers to continue operations and materially adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. The global market is also currently experiencing inflationary pressure, including rising fuel costs, a tightening steel market and labor and supply chain shortages, which could result in increases to our operating and capital costs that are not fixed. 
 Military and other armed conflicts, including terrorist activities, and related price volatility and geopolitical instability could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 Military and other armed conflicts, terrorist attacks and the threat of both, whether domestic or foreign, could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets. Continued instability in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries could adversely affect the global economy in unpredictable ways, including the disruption of energy supplies and markets, increased volatility in commodity prices, including petroleum products, or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism, and, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 For example, in late February 2022, Russia launched a military invasion against Ukraine. Sustained conflict and disruption in the region is likely in the near term, and the longer-term duration of the war is uncertain. The Russian invasion has caused, and could intensify, volatility in natural gas, oil and NGL prices, driving a sharp upward spike in the short term, and may have an impact on global growth prospects, which could in turn affect demand for natural gas and oil. Any such volatility, impacts on demand and disruptions may also magnify the impact of other risk factors described in this report.

Financial Risks Related to our Business 
 We have significant capital needs, and our ability to access the capital and credit markets to raise capital on favorable terms is limited by industry conditions. 
 Disruptions in the capital and credit markets, in particular with respect to the energy sector, could limit our ability to access these markets or may significantly increase our cost to borrow. In the past, low commodity prices have caused and may continue to cause lenders to increase the interest rates under upstream operators credit facilities, enact tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt around maturity on favorable terms or at all and may reduce or cease to provide funding to borrowers. Additionally, certain financial institutions have announced their intention to cease investment banking and corporate lending activities in the North American gas and oil sector or have established climate-related funding commitments that could have the effect of limiting their investment in us or our industry. If we are unable to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity and our ability to repay or refinance our debt. Additionally, challenges in the economy have led and could further lead to reductions in the demand for gas and oil, or further reductions in the prices of gas and oil, or both, which could have a negative impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Restrictive covenants in certain of our debt agreements could limit our growth and our ability to finance our operations, fund our capital needs, respond to changing conditions and engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests. 
 Our debt agreements impose operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability and that of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: 
 incur additional indebtedness; 
 make investments or loans; 
 create liens; 
 consummate mergers and similar fundamental changes; 
 make restricted payments; 
 make investments in unrestricted subsidiaries; 
 enter into transactions with affiliates; and 
 use the proceeds of asset sales. 
 
 We may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under certain of our debt agreements. The restrictions contained in the covenants could: 
 limit our ability to plan for, or react to, market conditions, to meet capital needs or otherwise to restrict our activities or business plan; and 
 adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, enter into acquisitions or divestitures to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest. 
 Our actual financial results after emergence from bankruptcy may not be comparable to our historical financial information as a result of the implementation of the Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby. 
 In connection with the disclosure statement we filed with the Bankruptcy Court, and the hearing to consider confirmation of the Plan, we prepared projected financial information to demonstrate to the Bankruptcy Court the feasibility of the Plan and our ability to continue operations upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Those projections were prepared solely for the purpose of bankruptcy proceedings and have not been, and will not be, updated on an ongoing basis and should not be relied upon by investors. At the time they were prepared, the projections reflected numerous assumptions concerning our anticipated future performance with respect to prevailing and anticipated market and economic conditions that were and remain beyond our control and that may not materialize. 
 35 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Projections are inherently subject to substantial and numerous uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks, and the assumptions underlying the projections and/or valuation estimates may prove to be incorrect in material respects. Actual results may vary significantly from those contemplated by the projections. As a result, investors should not rely on these projections. 
 
 Legal and Regulatory Risks 
 We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which can change and could adversely impact our business. 
 
 Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and other laws, rules and regulations, including with respect to environmental matters, worker health and safety, wildlife conservation, the gathering and transportation of gas, oil and NGL, conservation policies, reporting obligations, royalty payments, unclaimed property and the imposition of taxes, and tribal laws for a minor portion of our acreage. Such regulations include requirements for permits to drill and to conduct other operations and for provision of financial assurances (such as bonds) covering drilling, completion and well operations. If permits are not issued, or if unfavorable restrictions or conditions are imposed on our drilling or completion activities, we may not be able to conduct our operations as planned. For example, on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order indefinitely suspending new natural gas and oil leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal gas and oil permitting and leasing practices. The federal district court in Louisiana issued a permanent injunction against the executive order on August 18, 2022, limited to the thirteen plaintiff states, Louisiana, Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia. In response to the January 27, 2021 executive order, the U.S. Department of the Interior released its Report On The Federal Oil And Gas Leasing Program in November 2021, which assessed the current state of gas and oil leasing on federal lands and proposed several reforms, including raising royalty rates and implementing stricter standards for entities seeking to purchase gas and oil leases. Although we do not expect this ruling to impact the availability of onshore federal gas and oil lease sales, the Biden Administration s increased focus on the climate change impacts of federal projects could result in similar restrictions surrounding onshore drilling, onshore federal lease availability, and restrictions on the ability to obtain required permits, which could have a material adverse impact on our operations. In addition, we may be required to make large, sometimes unexpected, expenditures to comply with applicable governmental laws, rules, regulations, permits or orders. 
 
 In addition, changes in public policy have affected, and in the future could further affect, our operations. At both the federal and state level, for example, there are an increasing number of legislative initiatives and proposals that may lead to reduced demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas. These include certain tax advantages and other subsidies to support alternative energy sources or that mandate the use of specific fuels or technologies, in addition to the promotion of research into new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources. The IRA, signed by President Biden in August 2022, provides significant funding and incentives for research, development and implementation of low-carbon energy production methods, carbon capture, and other programs directed at addressing climate change. The IRA also includes a methane emissions reduction program that amends the Clean Air Act to include a Methane Emissions and Waste Reduction Incentive Program for petroleum and natural gas systems. This program requires the EPA to impose a waste emissions charge on certain natural gas and oil sources that are already required to report under EPA s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. Regulatory developments could, among other things, restrict production levels, impose price controls, change environmental protection requirements with respect to the treatment of hazardous waste, air emissions, or water discharges, and increase taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to the government. Our operating and compliance costs could increase further if existing laws and regulations are revised, reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. We do not expect that any of these laws and regulations will affect our operations materially differently than they would affect other companies with similar operations, size and financial strength. Although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations, such changes could significantly impact our profitability, financial condition and liquidity. This is particularly true of changes related to pipeline safety, hydraulic fracturing and climate change, as discussed below. 
 Pipeline Safety. The pipeline assets in which we own interests are subject to stringent and complex regulations related to pipeline safety and integrity management. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) has established a series of rules that require pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity 
 36 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 management programs for gas, NGL and condensate transmission pipelines as well as for certain low stress pipelines and gathering lines transporting hazardous liquids, such as oil, that, in the event of a failure, could affect high consequence areas. Recent PHMSA rules have also extended certain requirements for integrity assessments and leak detections beyond high consequence areas and impose a number of reporting and inspection requirements on regulated pipelines. In November 2021, PHMSA issued a final rule that expands certain federal pipeline safety requirements to all onshore gas gathering pipelines, regardless of size or location. The final rule establishes two new types of onshore gas gathering pipelines subject to varying degrees of regulation: all onshore gathering line operators are now subject to PHMSA s annual reporting and incident reporting requirements, and certain previously unregulated rural gas gathering lines must now comply with PHMSA damage prevention and, depending on the size of the pipeline, construction and operational requirements. The final rule became effective on May 16, 2022. Further, legislation funding PHMSA through 2023 requires the agency to engage in additional rulemaking to amend the integrity management program, emergency response plan, operation and maintenance manual, and pressure control recordkeeping requirements for gas distribution operators; to create new leak detection and repair program obligations; and to set new minimum federal safety standards for onshore gas gathering lines. At this time, we cannot predict the cost of these requirements or other potential new or amended regulations, but they could be significant. Moreover, violations of pipeline safety regulations can result in the imposition of significant penalties. 
 Hydraulic Fracturing. Several states have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure and/or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. State and federal regulatory agencies have also recently focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for natural gas and oil waste disposal and seismic activity. We cannot predict whether additional federal, state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and, if so, what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit. If additional levels of regulation or permitting requirements were imposed on hydraulic fracturing operations, our business and operations could be subject to delays, increased operating and compliance costs and potential bans. Additional regulation could also lead to greater opposition to hydraulic fracturing, including litigation. 
 
 Climate Change. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in legislative, regulatory and other initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide and methane. Policy makers at both the U.S. federal and state levels have introduced legislation and proposed new regulations designed to quantify and limit the emission of greenhouse gases through inventories, limitations and/or taxes on greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA and the BLM have issued regulations for the control of methane emissions, which also include leak detection and repair requirements, for the gas and oil industry and are likely to create additional regulations regarding such matters. For example, on November 15, 2021, the EPA proposed new regulations to establish comprehensive standards of performance and emission guidelines for methane and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from new and existing operations in the gas and oil sector, including the exploration and production, transmission, processing, and storage segments. The EPA issued a supplemental proposed rule on November 15, 2022 to update, strengthen and expand its November 2021 proposed rule. The supplemental proposed rule would impose more stringent requirements on the natural gas and oil industry. The rule is expected to be finalized in 2023. Additionally, on November 30, 2022, the BLM issued a proposed rule to reduce the methane waste from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and gas production activities on Federal and Indian leases. Once finalized, these regulations are likely to be subject to legal challenge. As a result, we cannot predict the scope of any final methane regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with such requirements. However, given the long-term trend toward increasing regulation, future federal GHG regulations of the gas and oil industry remain a significant possibility. In addition, several states in which we operate have imposed limitations designed to reduce methane emissions from gas and oil exploration and production activities. Legislative and state initiatives to date have generally focused on the development of renewable energy standards and/or cap-and-trade and/or carbon tax programs. Renewable energy standards (also referred to as renewable portfolio standards) require electric utilities to provide a specified minimum percentage of electricity from eligible renewable resources, with potential increases to the required percentage over time. The development of a federal renewable energy standard, or the development of additional or more stringent renewable energy standards at the state level could reduce the demand for gas and oil, thereby adversely impacting our earnings, cash flows and financial position. In addition, federal or state carbon taxes or fees could directly increase our costs of operation and similarly incentivize consumers to shift away from fossil fuels. 
 37 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 In addition, the SEC has issued proposed rules that would mandate extensive disclosure of climate-related risks and other information, including risk management, GHG emissions, financial impacts, and related governance and strategy. In addition to potential costs, these disclosures may be used by some activists for potential litigation or to pressure capital providers to restrict or eliminate investments or other funding. For more information see our risk factor titled Negative public perception regarding us or our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations. 
 These various legislative, regulatory and other activities addressing greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect our business, including by imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from, our equipment and operations, which could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations. Limitations on greenhouse gas emissions could also adversely affect demand for gas and oil, which could lower the value of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and liquidity. 
 Environmental matters and related costs can be significant. 
 As an owner, lessee or operator of gas and oil properties, we are subject to various federal, state, tribal and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of remediating pollution that results from our operations. Environmental laws may impose strict, joint and several liability, and failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal fines and penalties, as well as injunctions limiting operations in affected areas. Any future costs associated with these matters are uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including future changes to regulatory requirements. Changes in or additions to public policy regarding the protection of the environment could have a significant impact on our operations and profitability. 
 Increasing attention to ESG matters and our ability to achieve and maintain ESG certifications, goals and commitments may impact our business, financial results or stock price. 
 In recent years, increasing attention has been given to corporate activities related to ESG matters in public discourse and the investment community. Expectations regarding voluntary ESG initiatives and disclosures and consumer demand for more sustainable products, including alternative forms of energy, may result in increased costs (including but not limited to increased costs related to compliance, stakeholder engagement, contracting and insurance), changes in demand for certain products, increased availability of (and competition from) alternative energy sources and technologies, increased development of and demand for products that do not use fossil fuels or their derivatives, enhanced compliance or disclosure obligations, or other adverse impacts to our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Additionally, a number of advocacy groups, both domestically and internationally, have campaigned for governmental and private action to promote change at public companies related to ESG matters, including through the investment and voting practices of investment advisers, public pension funds, activist investors, universities and other members of the investing community. These activities include increasing attention and demands for action related to climate change, advocating for changes to companies boards of directors, and promoting the use of energy saving building materials. These activities may result in demand shifts for natural gas, oil and NGL in addition to potentially impacting our access to, and costs of, capital. 
 While we may at times engage in voluntary initiatives (such as voluntary disclosures, certifications, or targets, among others) or commitments to improve our ESG profile and/or products or to respond to stakeholder expectations, such initiatives or achievement of such commitments may be costly and may not have the desired effect. For example, expectations around management of ESG matters continues to evolve rapidly, in many instances due to factors that are out of our control. In addition, we may commit to certain initiatives or goals, and we may not ultimately be able to achieve such commitments or goals, either on the timeframes or costs initially anticipated or at all, due to factors that are within or outside of our control. Moreover, actions or statements that we may take based on expectations, assumptions, or third-party information that we currently believe to be reasonable may subsequently be determined to be erroneous or be subject to misinterpretation. Even if this is not the case, our current actions may subsequently be determined to be insufficient by various stakeholders, and we may be subject to investor or regulator engagement on our ESG initiatives and disclosures, even if such initiatives are currently voluntary. Any failure to comply with investor or customer expectations and standards, which are evolving, or if we are perceived to not have responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, could cause reputational harm to our business, increase our risk of litigation, 
 38 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, plaintiffs have brought litigation against various companies, including those in the fossil fuel sector, alleging that such companies created public nuisances by producing, handling or marketing fuels that contributed to climate change or that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but failed to adequately disclose those impacts. While we are not currently parties to any such litigation, the ultimate outcomes of such litigation and its impact to us are uncertain; we could incur substantial legal costs associated with defending against these or similar lawsuits in future. 
 In addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings systems for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. These ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us and our industry and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital. To the extent ESG matters negatively affect our reputation, it may also harm our ability to attract or retain employees or customers. 
 We expect there will likely be increasing levels of regulation, disclosure-related and otherwise, with respect to ESG matters, which will likely lead to increased compliance costs as well as scrutiny that could heighten all of the risks identified in this risk factor. Such ESG matters may also impact our suppliers or customers, which could augment existing, or cause additional, impacts to our business or operations. 
 The taxation of independent producers is subject to change, and changes in tax law could increase our cost of doing business . 
 We are subject to taxation by various governmental authorities at the federal, state and local levels in the jurisdictions in which we do business. New legislation could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities making it more costly for us to produce natural gas and oil by increasing our tax burden. The IRA was enacted on August 16, 2022, and includes, among other things, a 15 corporate minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income and a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks. Although we do not believe we will be subject to the corporate minimum tax in 2023, we may become subject to it in future years. Additionally, the Biden administration has called for changes to fiscal and tax policies which could lead to comprehensive tax reform. For example, federal legislation has been proposed that, if enacted, would impact federal income tax law applicable to the deduction of intangible drilling and development costs, percentage depletion and, the expensing of geological, geophysical, exploration and development costs. Other proposals changing federal income tax law could include an increase to the corporate tax rate, an increase to the excise tax on stock buybacks and the elimination of certain tax credits. If enacted, certain of these proposals could have a correlative impact on state income taxes. In addition, state and local authorities could enact new legislation that would increase various taxes such as sales, severance and ad valorem taxes as well as accelerate the collection of such taxes. 
 Trading in our New Common Stock, additional issuances of New Common Stock, and certain other stock transactions could lead to a second, potentially more restrictive annual limitation on the utilization of our tax attributes reducing their ability to offset future taxable income, which may result in an increase to income tax liabilities. 
 Upon emergence from bankruptcy on February 9, 2021, the Company experienced an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), as all of the common stock and preferred stock of the Predecessor, or the old loss corporation, was canceled and replaced with New Common Stock of the Successor, or the new loss corporation (the First Ownership Change ). As such, an annual limitation was computed based on the fair market value of the new equity immediately after emergence multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate in effect for the month of February 2021. This annual limitation will restrict the future utilization of our net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards, disallowed business interest carryforwards and tax credits that existed at the time of emergence. 
 Trading in our stock, additional issuances, and other stock transactions occurring subsequent to the emergence from Bankruptcy could lead to a second ownership change. In the event of a second ownership change, a second annual limitation would be determined at such time which could be more restrictive than the limitation of the First Ownership Change. Depending on the market conditions and the Company s tax basis, a second ownership change may result in a net unrealized built-in loss. 
 39 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 The annual limitation in such a case would additionally be applied to certain of the Company s tax items other than just NOL carryforwards, disallowed business interest carryforwards and tax credits. For example, a portion of tax depreciation, depletion and amortization would also be subject to the annual limitation for a five-year period following the ownership change but only to the extent of the net unrealized built-in loss existing at the time of the second ownership change. Whether the new annual limitation would be more restrictive would depend on the value of our stock and the long-term tax-exempt rate in effect at the time of a second ownership change. If the new annual limitation is more restrictive it would apply to certain of the tax attributes existing at the time of the second ownership change including those remaining from the time of the First Ownership Change. 
 Some states impose similar limitations on tax attribute utilization upon experiencing an ownership change.

 Item 2. Properties 
 Information regarding our properties is included in Item 1. Business and in the Supplementary Information included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. 

Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 Chapter 11 Proceedings 
 Commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases automatically stayed the proceedings and actions against us that are referenced below, in addition to actions seeking to collect pre-petition indebtedness or to exercise control over the property of the Company s bankruptcy estates. The Plan in the Chapter 11 Cases, which became effective on February 9, 2021, provided for the treatment of claims against the Company s bankruptcy estates, including pre-petition liabilities that had not been satisfied or addressed during the Chapter 11 Cases. See Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for additional information. 
 Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings 
 We were involved in a number of litigation and regulatory proceedings as of the Petition Date. Many of these proceedings were in early stages, and many of them sought damages and penalties, the amount of which is currently indeterminate. See Note 7 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for information regarding our estimation and provision for potential losses related to litigation and regulatory proceedings. 
 Business Operations. We are involved in various lawsuits and disputes incidental to our business operations, including commercial disputes, personal injury claims, royalty claims, property damage claims and contract actions. The majority of these prepetition legal proceedings were settled during the Chapter 11 Cases or will be resolved in connection with the claims reconciliation process before the Bankruptcy Court. Any allowed claim related to such prepetition litigation will be treated in accordance with the Plan. 
 Environmental Contingencies 
 The nature of the natural gas and oil business carries with it certain environmental risks for us and our subsidiaries. We have implemented various policies, programs, procedures, training and audits to reduce and mitigate such environmental risks. We conduct periodic reviews, on a company-wide basis, to assess changes in our environmental risk profile. Environmental reserves are established for environmental liabilities for which economic losses are probable and reasonably estimable. We manage our exposure to environmental liabilities in acquisitions by using an evaluation process that seeks to identify pre-existing contamination or compliance concerns and address the potential liability. Depending on the extent of an identified environmental concern, we may, among other things, exclude a property from the transaction, require the seller to remediate the property to our satisfaction in an acquisition or agree to assume liability for the remediation of the property.

 Other Matters 
 Based on management s current assessment, we are of the opinion that no pending or threatened lawsuit or dispute relating to our business operations is likely to have a material adverse effect on our future consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The final resolution of such matters could exceed amounts accrued, however, and actual results could differ materially from management s estimates. 
 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
 The information concerning mine safety violations and other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K (17CFR 229.104) is included in Exhibit 95.1 to this Form 10-K.

 Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 Common Stock 
 Upon our emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy on February 9, 2021, our then-authorized common stock and preferred stock were canceled and released under the Plan without receiving any recovery on account thereof. In accordance with the Plan confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on February 9, 2021, we issued 97,097,081 shares of New Common Stock of the Successor, which are listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol CHK. In addition, on February 9, 2021, we issued 11,111,111 Class A Warrants, 12,345,679 Class B Warrants and 9,768,527 Class C Warrants, each of which are exercisable for one share of common stock per warrant at the initial exercise prices of 27.63, 32.13 and 36.18 per share, respectively. The warrants are immediately exercisable and will expire on February 9, 2026. For more information regarding our emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy and our Plan of Reorganization, see Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. Additionally, more information on our New Common Stock and Warrants can be found in Note 12 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. 
 Dividends 
 We declared the first quarterly dividend on our New Common Stock in the second quarter of 2021, which consisted of a base dividend per share. In March 2022, we adopted a variable return program that resulted in the payment of an additional variable dividend equal to the sum of Adjusted Free Cash Flow from the prior quarter less the base quarterly dividend, multiplied by 50 . The declaration and payment of any future dividend is subject to the approval of our Board of Directors in its discretion. Since the initial base dividend declared during the second quarter of 2021, we have incrementally increased the base dividend per share. For additional information on our dividends, see Note 12 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with management s perspective on our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and certain other factors that may affect our future results. This information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance, current financial condition and outlook for the future and should be read in conjunction with Item 8 of Part II of this report. 
 Introduction 
 We are an independent exploration and production company engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of properties to produce natural gas, oil and NGL from underground reservoirs. We own a large portfolio of onshore U.S. unconventional natural gas and liquids assets, including interests in approximately 8,400 natural gas and oil wells as of December 31, 2022. Our natural gas resource plays are the Marcellus Shale in the northern Appalachian Basin in Pennsylvania Marcellus and the Haynesville/Bossier Shales in northwestern Louisiana Haynesville ). Our liquids-rich resource play is in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas Eagle Ford ). In August 2022, we announced that we viewed the assets in Eagle Ford as non-core to our future capital allocation strategy, and in January 2023, we entered into an agreement to sell a portion of our Eagle Ford assets to WildFire Energy I LLC for 1.425 billion. Additionally, in February 2023, we entered into an agreement to sell a portion of our remaining Eagle Ford assets to INEOS Energy for 1.4 billion. 
 Our strategy is to create shareholder value through the responsible development of our significant resource plays while continuing to be a leading provider of affordable, reliable, low carbon energy to the United States. We continue to focus on improving margins through operating efficiencies and financial discipline and improving our ESG performance. To accomplish these goals, we intend to allocate our human resources and capital expenditures to projects we believe offer the highest cash return on capital invested, to deploy leading drilling and completion technology throughout our portfolio, and to take advantage of acquisition and divestiture opportunities to strengthen our portfolio. We also intend to continue to dedicate capital to projects that reduce the environmental impact of our natural gas and oil producing activities. We continue to seek opportunities to reduce cash costs (production, gathering, processing and transportation and general and administrative), through operational efficiencies and improving our production volumes from existing wells. 
 Leading a responsible energy future is foundational to Chesapeake's success. Our core values and culture demand we continuously evaluate the environmental impact of our operations and work diligently to improve our ESG performance across all facets of our Company. Our path to answering the call for affordable, reliable, low carbon energy begins with our goal to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 2035. To meet this challenge, we have set meaningful goals including: 
 Eliminate routine flaring from all new wells completed from 2021 forward, and enterprise-wide by 2025; 
 Reduce our methane intensity to 0.02 by 2025 (achieved approximately 0.05 in 2022); and 
 Reduce our GHG intensity to 3.0 metric tons CO2 equivalent per thousand barrel of oil equivalent by 2025 (achieved approximately 3.9 in 2022). 
 In July 2021, we announced our plan to receive independent certification of our natural gas production under the MiQ methane standard and EO100 Standard for Responsible Energy Development. As of December 31, 2022, we have received certification for all our operated gas assets in Haynesville and Marcellus as responsibly sourced gas. The MiQ certification provides a verified approach to tracking our commitment to reduce our methane intensity, as well as support our overall objective of achieving net-zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2035.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Our results of operations as reported in our consolidated financial statements for the 2022 Successor Period, 2021 Successor Period, 2021 Predecessor Period and 2020 Predecessor Period are in accordance with GAAP. Although GAAP requires that we report on our results for the periods January 1, 2021 through February 9, 2021 and February 10, 2021 through December 31, 2021 separately, management views our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2021 by combining the results of the 2021 Predecessor Period and the 2021 Successor Period because management believes such presentation provides the most meaningful comparison of our results to prior periods. We are not able to compare the 40 days from January 1, 2021 through February 9, 2021 operating results to any of the previous periods reported in the consolidated financial statements and do not believe reviewing this period in isolation would be useful in identifying any trends in, or reaching any conclusions regarding, our overall operating performance. We believe the key performance indicators, such as operating revenues and expenses for the 2021 Successor Period combined with the 2021 Predecessor Period, provide more meaningful comparisons to other periods and are useful in understanding operational trends. Additionally, there were no changes in policies between the periods, and any material impacts as a result of fresh start accounting were included within the discussion of these changes. These combined results do not comply with GAAP and have not been prepared as pro forma results under applicable regulations, but are presented because we believe they provide the most meaningful comparison of our results to prior periods. 
 Recent Developments 
 Acquisitions 
 On March 9, 2022, we completed our Marcellus Acquisition pursuant to definitive agreements with Chief, Radler and Tug Hill, Inc. dated January 24, 2022. On November 1, 2021, we completed our Vine Acquisition pursuant to a definitive agreement with Vine dated August 10, 2021. These transactions strengthen Chesapeake s competitive position, meaningfully increasing our operating cash flows and adding high quality producing assets and a deep inventory of premium drilling locations, while preserving the strength of our balance sheet. 
 Divestitures 
 On March 25, 2022, we completed the sale of our Powder River Basin assets in Wyoming to Continental Resources, Inc. for 450 million in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments, which resulted in the recognition of a gain of approximately 293 million. 
 On January 17, 2023, we entered into an agreement to sell a portion of our Eagle Ford assets to WildFire Energy I LLC for 1.425 billion. This transaction, which is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including certain regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the assets and liabilities associated with this transaction were classified as held for sale. 
 On February 17, 2023 we entered into an agreement to sell a portion of our remaining Eagle Ford assets to INEOS Energy for 1.4 billion. This transaction, which is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including certain regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023. 
 Investments - Momentum Sustainable Ventures LLC 
 During the fourth quarter of 2022, we entered into an agreement with Momentum Sustainable Ventures LLC to build a new natural gas gathering pipeline and carbon capture and sequestration project, which will gather natural gas produced in the Haynesville Shale for re-delivery to Gulf Coast markets, including LNG export. The pipeline is expected to have an initial capacity of 1.7 Bcf/d expandable to 2.2 Bcf/d. The carbon capture portion of the project anticipates capturing and permanently sequestering up to 2.0 million tons per annum of CO2. The natural gas gathering pipeline in-service is projected for the fourth quarter of 2024, and the carbon sequestration portion of the project is subject to regulatory approvals. As of December 31, 2022, we have made capital contributions of 18 million to the project.

 New Credit Facility 
 On December 9, 2022, we entered into a new senior secured reserve-based revolving credit agreement providing for the New Credit Facility, which features an initial borrowing base of 3.5 billion and aggregate commitments of 2.0 billion. The New Credit Facility includes terms that change favorably upon us receiving and maintaining investment grade ratings by S P, Moody s and/or Fitch and the satisfaction of certain other conditions. The New Credit Facility matures in December 2027. 
 Repurchases of Equity Securities and Dividends 
 In June 2022, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the size of our share repurchase program from 1.0 billion to up to 2.0 billion in aggregate value of our common stock and/or warrants. During 2022, we repurchased approximately 11.7 million shares of our common stock pursuant to the share repurchase program and had 927 million available under the share repurchase program as of December 31, 2022. In addition, we have paid dividends of approximately 1.2 billion, in aggregate, on our common stock during 2022. In August 2022, we increased our quarterly base dividend by 10 to 0.55 per share beginning with the dividend that was paid on September 1, 2022. 
 Warrant Exchange Offer 
 In August 2022, we announced exchange offers relating to our outstanding Class A Warrants, Class B Warrants, and Class C Warrants. The exchange offers expired in October 2022 and resulted in the issuance of 16,305,984 shares of our common stock in exchange for the cancellation of (i) 4,752,207 Class A Warrants, or approximately 51.4 of the outstanding Class A Warrants, at the time of exchange, (ii) 7,879,030 Class B Warrants, or approximately 64.1 of the outstanding Class B Warrants, at the time of exchange, and (iii) 7,252,004 Class C Warrants, or approximately 64.8 of the outstanding Class C Warrants, at the time of exchange. 
 COVID-19 Pandemic and Impact on Global Demand for Natural Gas and Oil 
 The global spread of COVID-19 created significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption commencing in 2020, and threatens to continue to do so in 2023. The ongoing pandemic has resulted in widespread adverse impacts on the global economy and on our customers and other parties with whom we have business relations. To date, we have experienced limited operational impacts as a result of COVID-19 or related governmental restrictions. While we cannot predict the full impact that COVID-19 and its variants, or the related significant disruption and volatility in the natural gas and oil markets will have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, we believe our cost structure and liquidity position us well to address continued price and demand volatility. For additional discussion regarding risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, see Item 1A Risk Factors in this report. 
 Russia s Invasion of Ukraine; Volatility in Natural Gas, Oil and NGL Prices; and Inflationary Cost Pressures 
 
 In late February 2022, Russia launched a military invasion against Ukraine. The Russian invasion has caused, and could intensify, volatility in natural gas, oil and NGL prices, and may have an impact on global growth prospects, which could in turn affect demand for natural gas and oil. This overall uncertainty resulted in stronger commodity prices during much of 2022. Toward the end of 2022, markets began to stabilize, and this, coupled with a milder winter, has resulted in an observed decline in pricing in early 2023. Our 2023 estimated cash flow is partially protected from commodity price volatility due to our current hedge positions that cover approximately 56 of our projected natural gas volumes for 2023. In addition to the recent weakening in commodity prices, the industry is experiencing inflationary pressure, including rising fuel costs, a tightening steel market, and labor and supply chain shortages, which could result in increases to our operating and capital costs that are not fixed. We continue to monitor the situation and assess its impact on our business, including our business partners and customers, as we work to limit our supply chain risk.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity Overview 
 For the 2022 Successor Period, our primary sources of capital resources and liquidity have consisted of internally generated cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreements, and our primary uses of cash have been for the development of our natural gas and oil properties, acquisitions of additional natural gas properties and return of value to stockholders through dividends and equity repurchases. Historically, our primary sources of capital resources and liquidity have consisted of internally generated cash flows from operations, borrowings under certain credit agreements and dispositions of non-core assets. Our ability to issue additional indebtedness, dispose of assets or access the capital markets was substantially limited during the Chapter 11 Cases and required court approval in most instances. Accordingly, our liquidity in the 2021 and 2020 Predecessor Periods depended mainly on cash generated from operations and available funds under certain credit agreements including the DIP Facility in the 2021 Predecessor Period and revolving credit facility in the 2020 Predecessor Period. 
 We believe we have emerged from the Chapter 11 Cases as a fundamentally stronger company, built to generate sustainable Free Cash Flow with a strengthened balance sheet, large portfolio of onshore U.S. unconventional natural gas and liquids assets and improving ESG performance. As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, we reduced our total indebtedness by 9.4 billion by issuing equity in a reorganized entity to the holders of our FLLO Term Loan, Second Lien Notes, unsecured notes and allowed general unsecured claimants. 
 In December 2022, we entered into a New Credit Facility and terminated the Exit Credit Facility, repaying all amounts outstanding and extinguishing all commitments thereunder. We believe our cash flow from operations, cash on hand and borrowing capacity under the New Credit Facility, as discussed below, will provide sufficient liquidity during the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2022, we had 1.0 billion of liquidity available, including 130 million of cash on hand and 0.9 billion of aggregate unused borrowing capacity available under the New Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2022, we had 1.05 billion of outstanding borrowings under our New Credit Facility and 35 million utilized for various letters of credit. See Note 6 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further discussion of our debt obligations, including principal and carrying amounts of our senior notes. 
 Dividends 
 We declared the first quarterly dividend on our New Common Stock in the second quarter of 2021, which consisted of a base dividend per share. In March 2022, we adopted a variable return program that resulted in the payment of an additional variable dividend per share equal to the sum of the Adjusted Free Cash Flow from the prior quarter less the base quarterly dividend, multiplied by 50 . Under this base and variable dividend approach, we paid dividends of 1.2 billion, in aggregate, on our common stock in the 2022 Successor Period. See Note 12 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further discussion. 
 The declaration and payment of any future dividend, whether fixed or variable, will remain at the full discretion of the Board and will depend on the Company s financial results, cash requirements, future prospects and other relevant factors. The Company s ability to pay dividends to its stockholders is restricted by (i) Oklahoma corporate law, (ii) its Certificate of Incorporation, (iii) the terms and provisions of the credit agreement governing its New Credit Facility and (iv) the terms and provisions of the indentures governing its 5.50 Senior Notes due 2026, 5.875 Senior Notes due 2029 and 6.75 Senior Notes due 2029.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Derivative and Hedging Activities 
 Our results of operations and cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for natural gas, oil and NGL. We enter into various derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of our exposure to commodity price declines, but these transactions may also limit our cash flows in periods of rising commodity prices. Our natural gas, oil and NGL derivative activities, when combined with our sales of natural gas, oil and NGL, allow us to better predict the total revenue we expect to receive. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in Part II of this report for further discussion on the impact of commodity price risk on our financial position. 
 Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of December 31, 2022, our material contractual obligations include repayment of senior notes, outstanding borrowings and interest payment obligations under the New Credit Facility, derivative obligations, asset retirement obligations, lease obligations, capital commitments relating to our investments, undrawn letters of credit and various other commitments we enter into in the ordinary course of business that could result in future cash obligations. In addition, we have contractual commitments with midstream companies and pipeline carriers for future gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas, oil and NGL to move certain of our production to market. The estimated gross undiscounted future commitments under these agreements were approximately 4.3 billion as of December 31, 2022. As discussed above, we believe our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our near and long-term contractual obligations. See Notes 6 , 7 , 9 , 15 , 18 and 2 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further discussion. 
 New Credit Facility 
 On December 9, 2022, the Company, as borrower, entered into a senior secured reserve-based credit agreement providing for the New Credit Facility which features an initial borrowing base of 3.5 billion and aggregate commitments of 2.0 billion. Subject to certain exceptions, the borrowing base will be redetermined semi-annually on or around April 15 and October 15 of each year. The New Credit Facility provides for a 200 million sublimit available for the issuance of letters of credit and a 50 million sublimit available for swingline loans. Borrowings under the credit agreement may be alternate base rate loans or term SOFR loans, at the Company s election. The New Credit Facility contains certain features that, upon receipt and maintenance of investment grade ratings from S P, Moody s and/or Fitch and the satisfaction of certain other conditions, result in the removal or relaxation of specified negative and financial covenants, among other favorable adjustments. See Note 6 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further discussion. 
 Post-Emergence Debt 
 On the Effective Date, pursuant to the terms of the Plan, the Company, as borrower, entered into a reserve-based credit agreement providing for the Exit Credit Facility which featured an initial borrowing base of 2.5 billion. The aggregate initial elected commitments of the lenders under the Exit Credit Facility were 1.75 billion of revolving Tranche A Loans and 221 million of fully funded Tranche B Loans. 
 The Exit Credit Facility provided for a 200 million sublimit of the aggregate commitments that were available for the issuance of letters of credit. The Exit Credit Facility bore interest at the ABR (alternate base rate) or LIBOR, at our election, plus an applicable margin (ranging from 2.25 3.25 per annum for ABR loans and 3.25 4.25 per annum for LIBOR loans, subject to a 1.00 LIBOR floor), depending on the percentage of the borrowing base then being utilized. The Tranche A Loans were due to mature 3 years after the Effective Date and the Tranche B Loans were due to mature 4 years after the Effective Date. In December 2022, in conjunction with our entry into the New Credit Facility, the Exit Credit Facility was terminated, repaying all amounts outstanding and extinguishing all commitments thereunder. 
 On February 2, 2021, the Company issued 500 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.50 Senior Notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes and 500 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.875 Senior Notes due 2029 (the 2029 Notes and, together with the 2026 Notes, the Notes ). The offering of the Notes was part of a series of exit financing transactions undertaken in connection with the Debtors Chapter 11 Cases and meant to provide the exit financing originally intended to be provided by the Exit Term Loan Facility pursuant to the Commitment Letter.

 Assumption and Repayment of Vine Debt 
 In conjunction with the Vine Acquisition, Vine s Second Lien Term Loan was repaid and terminated for 163 million inclusive of a 13 million make whole premium with cash on hand, due to the agreement containing a change in control provision making the term loan callable upon closing. Vine s reserve-based loan facility, which had no borrowings as of November 1, 2021, was terminated at the time of the completion of the Vine Acquisition. Additionally, Vine s 6.75 Senior Notes with a principal amount of 950 million, were assumed by the Company at the time of the completion of the Vine Acquisition. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 For the year ending December 31, 2023, we currently expect to bring or have online approximately 145 to 165 gross wells across 10 to 12 rigs and plan to invest between approximately 1.765 1.835 billion in capital expenditures. We expect that approximately 85 of our 2023 capital expenditures will be directed toward our natural gas assets. We currently plan to fund our 2023 capital program through cash on hand, expected cash flow from our operations and borrowings under our New Credit Facility. We may alter or change our plans with respect to our capital program and expected capital expenditures based on developments in our business, our financial position, our industry or any of the markets in which we operate.

 Sources and (Uses) of Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 The following table presents the sources and uses of our cash and cash equivalents for the periods presented:

 Cash Flow from Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 4.12 billion, 1.81 billion and 1.16 billion in the 2022 Successor Period, 2021 Successor Period and 2020 Predecessor Period, respectively. Cash used in operating activities was 21 million for the 2021 Predecessor Period. The increase in the 2022 Successor Period is primarily due to higher prices for the natural gas, oil and NGL we sold and increased volumes sold due to the Vine Acquisition and Marcellus Acquisition. The increase in the 2021 Successor Period is primarily the result of higher prices for the natural gas, oil and NGL we sold, coupled with a decrease in cash interest and GP T costs following our emergence from bankruptcy. The cash used in the 2021 Predecessor Period was primarily in connection with the payment of professional fees related to the Chapter 11 Cases. Cash flows from operations are largely affected by the same factors that affect our net income, excluding various non-cash items, such as depreciation, depletion and amortization, certain impairments, gains or losses on sales of assets, deferred income taxes and mark-to-market changes in our open derivative instruments. See further discussion below under Results of Operations . 
 Proceeds from New Credit Facility, net 
 In the 2022 Successor Period, we borrowed a net 1.05 billion under the New Credit Facility. We utilized these borrowings to terminate the Exit Credit Facility, including the repayment of outstanding Tranche A Loans and Tranche B Loans thereunder, backstopping certain letters of credit, and the payment of fees and expenses in connection with the termination of the Exit Credit Facility and entry into the New Credit Facility. A portion of the borrowings under the New Credit Facility were repaid with internally generated cash provided by operating activities.

Additionally, upon emergence from Chapter 11, we issued 62,927,320 shares of New Common Stock in exchange for 600 million of cash, as agreed upon in the Plan. See Note 6 and Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further discussion. 
 Divestitures of Property and Equipment 
 In the 2022 Successor Period, we sold our Powder River Basin assets to Continental Resources, Inc. for approximately 450 million, subject to post-close adjustments. In the 2021 Successor Period, we divested certain non-core assets for approximately 13 million. In the 2020 Predecessor Period, we divested our Mid-Continent asset for 130 million and certain non-core assets for approximately 6 million. See Note 4 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further discussion. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Our capital expenditures significantly increased in the 2022 Successor Period compared to the combined 2021 Successor and Predecessor Periods primarily as a result of increased drilling and completion activity in Haynesville and Marcellus, following the Vine Acquisition and Marcellus Acquisition, respectively. Our capital expenditures decreased in the combined 2021 Successor and Predecessor Periods compared to the 2020 Predecessor Period primarily as a result of decreased drilling and completion activity mainly in our liquids-rich plays. In the 2022 Successor Period, our average operated rig count was 14 rigs and 217 spud wells, compared to an average operated rig count of 7 rigs and 121 spud wells in the combined 2021 Successor and Predecessor Periods and 8 rigs and 167 spud wells in the 2020 Predecessor Period. We completed 216 operated wells in the 2022 Successor Period compared to 127 in the combined 2021 Successor and Predecessor Periods and 188 in the 2020 Predecessor Period. 
 Business Combination, net 
 In the 2022 Successor Period, we completed the Marcellus Acquisition for approximately 2 billion and 9.4 million shares of our common stock. In the 2021 Successor Period, we acquired Vine for approximately 18.7 million shares of our New Common Stock and 253 million cash, less 59 million of cash held by Vine as of the acquisition date. See Note 4 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further discussion of these acquisitions. 
 Contributions to Investments 
 During the 2022 Successor Period, we made an initial contribution of 18 million to our investment with Momentum Sustainable Ventures LLC to build a new natural gas gathering pipeline and carbon capture project. See Note 18 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for additional information. 
 
 Payments on Exit Credit Facility, net 
 In December 2022, we entered into the New Credit Facility and terminated the Exit Credit Facility, repaying all amounts outstanding and extinguishing all commitments thereunder. 
 
 Payments on DIP Facility Borrowings 
 On the Effective Date, the DIP Facility was terminated, and the holders of obligations under the DIP Facility received payment in full in cash; provided that to the extent such lender under the DIP Facility was also a lender under the Exit Credit Facility, such lender s allowed DIP claims were first reduced dollar-for-dollar and satisfied by the amount of its Exit RBL Loans provided as of the Effective Date.

 Debt Issuance and Other Financing Costs 
 During the 2022 Successor Period, we paid 17 million of one-time fees to lenders to establish the New Credit Facility. In the 2020 Predecessor Period, we paid 109 million of one-time fees to lenders to establish our DIP Credit Facility and Exit Credit Facility. 
 Cash Paid to Purchase Debt 
 In the 2020 Predecessor Period, we repurchased approximately 160 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes for 94 million. 
 Cash Paid for Common Stock Dividends 
 As part of our dividend program, we paid common stock base dividends of 256 million and common stock variable dividends of 956 million in the 2022 Successor Period. During the 2021 Successor Period, we paid common stock base dividends of 119 million. See Note 12 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further discussion. 
 Cash Paid for Preferred Stock Dividends 
 We paid dividends of 22 million on our Predecessor preferred stock during the 2020 Predecessor Period. On April 17, 2020, we announced that we were suspending payment of dividends on each series of our outstanding convertible preferred stock. On the Effective Date of the Chapter 11 Cases, each holder of an equity interest in the Predecessor had such interest canceled, released, and extinguished without any distribution. See Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for additional information about the Chapter 11 Cases. 
 Cash Paid to Repurchase and Retire Common Stock 
 In March 2022, we commenced our share repurchase program, and throughout the 2022 Successor Period, we repurchased 11.7 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of 1.1 billion. The shares of common stock that were repurchased during the 2022 Successor Period were retired and recorded as a reduction to common stock and retained earnings.

 Natural gas, oil and NGL sales in the 2022 Successor Period increased 5.093 billion compared to the combined 2021 Successor and Predecessor Periods. The increase was attributable to a 2.773 billion increase in revenues from higher average prices received. Additionally, an increase of 2.320 billion was due to increased volumes in Marcellus and Haynesville primarily due to the Marcellus Acquisition and the Vine Acquisition, respectively. These increases were partially offset by decreased volumes in Eagle Ford, which was primarily due to a natural decline in production, and the Powder River Basin, following the divestiture of the Powder River Basin assets in March 2022.

 Marketing revenues and expenses increased in the 2022 Successor Period as a result of increased natural gas, oil and NGL prices received in our marketing operation. Additionally, during the 2022 Successor Period, marketing revenues and expenses increased due to increased volumes from the Vine Acquisition and Marcellus Acquisition. 
 
 Exploration Expenses 
 During the 2022 Successor Period, exploration expense charges of 23 million were primarily the result of non-cash impairment charges in unproved properties of 8 million, 6 million of charges related to dry hole expense and 6 million of geological and geophysical expense. We did not have material exploration expenses during the 2021 Successor Period or 2021 Predecessor Period.

 During the 2022 Successor Period, we recognized approximately 41 million of costs related to our Marcellus Acquisition, which included integration costs, consulting fees, financial advisory fees, legal fees and change in control expense in accordance with Chief s existing employment agreements. In the 2021 Successor Period we recognized approximately 59 million of costs related to the Vine Acquisition, which included consulting fees, financial advisory fees and legal fees. Additionally, we recognized approximately 36 million of severance expense as a result of the Vine Acquisition, which included 15 million of cash severance and 21 million of non-cash severance, primarily related to the issuance of New Common Stock for the acceleration of certain Vine restricted stock unit awards. A majority of Vine executives and employees were terminated on the date the Vine Acquisition was completed. These executives and employees were entitled to severance benefits in accordance with existing employment agreements. 
 Interest Expense

 The increase in total interest expense in the 2022 Successor Period compared to the combined 2021 Successor and Predecessor Periods, was primarily due to the increase in outstanding debt obligations between periods. In November 2021, we assumed Vine s 950 million of senior notes as part of the Vine Acquisition, and during the 2022 Successor Period, we had increased borrowings under our various credit agreements, compared to the combined 2021 Successor and Predecessor Periods. During the 2022 Successor Period, borrowings under our credit agreements had an average interest rate of 8.7 . Additionally, 12 million of interest expense was recorded during the 2022 Successor Period pertaining to a tax interest assessment.

See Note 2 and Note 3 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for a discussion of the Chapter 11 Cases and for discussion of adoption of fresh start accounting. We did not have any reorganization items, net for the 2022 Successor Period or the 2021 Successor Period. 
 Income Tax Expense (Benefit). We recorded an income tax benefit of 1.3 billion in the 2022 Successor Period. In the 2021 Successor and Predecessor Periods, we recorded an income tax benefit of 49 million and 57 million, respectively. Of the 1.3 billion of income tax benefit recorded in the 2022 Successor Period, 1.4 billion is related to the partial release of the valuation allowance, which is partially offset by 47 million in current federal and state income taxes. The income tax benefit recorded in the 2021 Successor Period is related to a 49 million partial release of the valuation allowance maintained against our net deferred tax asset position. The partial release was a consequence of recording a net deferred tax liability of 49 million resulting from the business combination accounting for Vine. The 57 million income tax benefit for the 2021 Predecessor Period consists of the removal of the income tax effects in other comprehensive income related to hedging settlements due to the fair value adjustments made upon emergence from bankruptcy. See Note 11 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for a discussion of income tax expense (benefit).

Non-GAAP Measures 
 Management uses adjusted gross margin to assess our operating results and financial performance across assets and periods. We define adjusted gross margin as natural gas, oil and NGL sales less production expenses, gathering, processing and transportation expenses, and severance and ad valorem taxes. 
 
 Adjusted gross margin is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported under GAAP. Additionally, adjusted gross margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. We exclude depreciation, depletion and amortization from the calculation of adjusted gross margin as depreciation, depletion and amortization are non-cash expenses that do not necessarily reflect present-day performance. The table below reconciles gross margin, as defined by GAAP, to adjusted gross margin.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require us to make estimates and assumptions. The accounting estimates and assumptions that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations are discussed below. Our management has discussed each critical accounting estimate with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 
 Natural Gas and Oil Reserves. Estimates of natural gas and oil reserves and their values, future production rates, future development costs and commodity pricing differentials are the most significant of our estimates. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of data available and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. In addition, estimates of reserves may be revised based on actual production, results of subsequent exploration and development activities, recent commodity prices, operating costs and other factors. These revisions could materially affect our financial statements. The volatility of commodity prices results in increased uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions. Changes in natural gas, oil or NGL prices could result in actual results differing significantly from our estimates. See Supplemental Disclosures About Natural Gas, Oil and NGL Producing Activities included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further information. 
 Accounting for Business Combinations. We account for business combinations using the acquisition method, which is the only method permitted under FASB ASC Topic 805 Business Combinations, and involves the use of significant judgment. Under the acquisition method of accounting, a business combination is accounted for at a purchase price based on the fair value of the consideration given. The assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair values, and the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon these fair values. The excess, if any, of the consideration given to acquire an entity over the net amounts assigned to its assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The excess, if any, of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquired entity is recognized immediately to earnings as a gain from bargain purchase. 
 The Company s principal assets are its natural gas and oil properties, which are accounted for under the successful efforts accounting method. The Company determines the fair value of acquired natural gas and oil properties based on the discounted future net cash flows expected to be generated from these assets. Discounted cash flow models by operating area are prepared using the estimated future revenues and operating costs for all proved developed properties and undeveloped properties comprising the proved and unproved reserves. Significant inputs associated with the calculation of discounted future net cash flows include estimates of (i) recoverable reserves, (ii) production rates, (iii) future operating and development costs, (iv) future commodity prices escalated by an inflationary rate after five years, adjusted for differentials, and (v) a market-based weighted average cost of capital by operating area. The Company utilizes NYMEX strip pricing, adjusted for differentials, to value the reserves. The NYMEX strip pricing inputs used are classified as Level 1 fair value assumptions and all other inputs are classified as Level 3 fair value assumptions. The discount rates utilized are derived using a weighted average cost of capital computation, which includes an estimated cost of debt and equity for market participants with similar geographies and asset development type by operating area. 
 Income Taxes. Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method as required by GAAP. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets for tax attributes such as NOL carryforwards and disallowed business interest carryforwards are also recognized. Deferred tax assets represent potential future tax benefits and are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that such benefits will not be realized. 
 In assessing the need for a valuation allowance or adjustments to existing valuation allowances, one source of evidence is a projection of income exclusive of existing timing differences. 
 Our judgement regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets is thus partially affected by estimates of future financial condition. 
 In interim quarters our tax provision is based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate, which is determined through the usage of full year estimates. Thus, our quarterly income tax expense or benefit can fluctuate throughout the year as a result of changing financial forecasts.

 We also routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, establish accruals for such positions. Accounting guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions requires that a more likely than not threshold condition be met on a tax position, based solely on its technical merits of being sustained, before any benefit of the uncertain tax position can be recognized in the financial statements. If it is more likely than not a tax position will be sustained, we measure and recognize the position following a cumulative probability estimate. 
 Impairments . Long-lived assets used in operations, including proved gas and oil properties, are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is assessed by management through an established process in which changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes, and future development plans are reviewed. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value by discounting using a weighted average cost of capital. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is assessed by management using the income approach. Level 3 inputs associated with the calculation of discounted cash flows used in the impairment analysis include our estimate of future natural gas and crude oil prices, production costs, development expenditures, anticipated production of proved reserves and other relevant data. Additionally, we utilize NYMEX strip pricing, adjusted for differentials, to value the reserves. 
 Reorganization and Fresh Start Accounting. Effective June 28, 2020, as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases we began accounting and reporting according to FASB ASC Topic 852 Reorganizations ASC 852 ), which specifies the accounting and financial reporting requirements for entities reorganizing through Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. These requirements include distinguishing and presenting transactions associated with the reorganization and implementation of the plan of reorganization separately from activities related to ongoing operations of the business. Additionally, upon emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, ASC 852 required us to allocate our reorganization value to our individual assets based on their estimated fair values, resulting in a new entity for financial reporting purposes. After the Effective Date, the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC 852 are no longer applicable and have no impact on the Successor periods.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our exposure to market risk. The term market risk relates to our risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas, oil and NGL prices and interest rates. These disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. The forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Our results of operations and cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for natural gas, oil and NGL, which have historically been volatile. To mitigate a portion of our exposure to adverse price changes, we enter into various derivative instruments. Our natural gas, oil and NGL derivative activities, when combined with our sales of natural gas, oil and NGL, allow us to predict with greater certainty the revenue we will receive. We believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving our risk management objectives. 
 We determine the fair value of our derivative instruments utilizing established index prices, volatility curves and discount factors. These estimates are compared to counterparty valuations for reasonableness. Derivative transactions are also subject to the risk that counterparties will be unable to meet their obligations. This non-performance risk is considered in the valuation of our derivative instruments, but to date has not had a material impact on the values of our derivatives. Future risk related to counterparties not being able to meet their obligations has been partially mitigated under our commodity hedging arrangements that require counterparties to post collateral if their obligations to us are in excess of defined thresholds. The values we report in our financial statements are as of a point in time and subsequently change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, changes in market conditions and other factors. See Note 15 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further discussion of the fair value measurements associated with our derivatives. 
 For the 2022 Successor Period, natural gas, oil and NGL revenues, excluding any effect of our derivative instruments, were 7.803 billion, 1.864 billion, and 225 million, respectively. Based on production, natural gas, oil and NGL revenue for the 2022 Successor Period would have increased or decreased by approximately 780 million, 186 million, and 23 million, respectively, for each 10 increase or decrease in prices. As of December 31, 2022, the fair values of our natural gas and oil derivatives were net liabilities of 501 million and 24 million, respectively. A 10 increase in forward natural gas prices would decrease the valuation of natural gas derivatives by approximately 324 million, while a 10 decrease would increase the valuation by 321 million. A 10 increase in forward oil prices would decrease the valuation of oil derivatives by 22 million, while a 10 decrease would increase the valuation by 22 million. This fair value change assumes volatility based on prevailing market parameters at December 31, 2022. See Note 15 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for further information on our open derivative positions. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our exposure to interest rate changes relates primarily to borrowings under our New Credit Facility and Exit Credit Facility for the 2022 Successor Period, the Exit Credit Facility for the 2021 Successor Period and the pre-petition revolving credit facility and DIP Facility for the 2021 and 2020 Predecessor Periods. Interest is payable on borrowings under these credit agreements based on a floating rate. See Note 6 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for additional information. As of December 31, 2022, we had 1.05 billion of outstanding borrowings under our New Credit Facility. A 1.0 increase in interest rates based on the variable borrowings as of December 31, 2022 would result in an increase in our interest expense of approximately 11 million per year.

 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Chesapeake Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries (Successor) (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of stockholders equity and of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from February 10, 2021 through December 31, 2021, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from February 10, 2021 through December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 
 Basis of Accounting 
 
 As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Chesapeake Energy Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively the Debtors filed voluntary petitions on June 28, 2020 with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas for relief under the provisions of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Debtors joint plan of reorganization on January 16, 2021 and the Debtors emerged from bankruptcy on February 9, 2021. In connection with its emergence from bankruptcy, the Company adopted fresh start accounting as of February 9, 2021. 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 
 The Impact of Proved Natural Gas and Oil Reserves on Proved Natural Gas and Oil Properties, Net 
 
 As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s property and equipment, net balance was approximately 11.2 billion as of December 31, 2022, and depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD A) expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 1.8 billion, both of which substantially related to proved natural gas and oil properties. The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its natural gas and oil properties. Under this method, all capitalized well costs and leasehold costs of proved natural gas and oil properties are depreciated by the units-of-production (UOP) method based on total estimated proved developed reserves and proved reserves, respectively. As disclosed by management, estimates of natural gas and oil reserves and their values, future production rates, future development costs and commodity pricing differentials are the most significant of management s estimates. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of data available and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. In addition, estimates of reserves volumes may be revised based on actual production, results of subsequent exploration and development activities, recent commodity prices, operating costs and other factors. The estimates of proved natural gas and oil reserves have been developed by specialists, specifically petroleum engineers. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impact of proved natural gas and oil reserves on proved natural gas and oil properties, net is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management, including the use of specialists, when developing the estimates of proved natural gas and oil reserves, which in turn led to (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the data, methods, and assumptions used by management and its specialists in developing the estimates of proved natural gas and oil reserves volumes and the assumptions applied to the data related to the commodity pricing differentials and future development costs.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s estimates of proved natural gas and oil reserves. The work of management s specialists was used in performing procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the proved natural gas and oil reserves volumes. As a basis for using this work, the specialists qualifications were understood and the Company s relationship with the specialists was assessed. The procedures performed also included evaluating the methods and assumptions used by the specialists, testing the completeness and accuracy of the data used by the specialists, and evaluating the specialists findings. These procedures also included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the data related to commodity pricing differentials and future development costs. Additionally, these procedures included evaluating whether the assumptions applied to the aforementioned data were reasonable considering the past performance of the Company. 
 
 Marcellus Acquisition - Valuation of Proved and Unproved Natural Gas and Oil Properties 
 
 As described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, on March 9, 2022, the Company completed the Marcellus Acquisition. Accordingly, the Company recorded the estimated fair values of the acquired proved natural gas and oil properties of approximately 2.3 billion and 788 million for unproved properties, respectively. As disclosed by management, management determines the fair value of acquired natural gas and oil properties based on the discounted future net cash flows expected to be generated from these assets. Discounted cash flow models by operating area are prepared using the estimated future revenues and operating costs for all proved developed properties and undeveloped properties comprising the proved and unproved reserves. Significant inputs associated with the calculation of discounted future net cash flows include estimates of (i) recoverable reserves, (ii) production rates, (iii) future operating and development costs, (iv) future commodity prices escalated by an inflationary rate after five years, adjusted for differentials, and (v) a market-based weighted average cost of capital by operating area. The estimates of proved and unproved natural gas and oil reserves have been developed by specialists, specifically petroleum engineers. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of proved and unproved natural gas and oil properties in the Marcellus Acquisition is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management, including the use of specialists, when developing the fair value estimate of the proved and unproved natural gas and oil properties acquired, which in turn led to (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s significant inputs related to recoverable reserves; production rates; future operating and development costs; future commodity prices escalated by an inflationary rate after five years, adjusted for differentials; and a market-based weighted average cost of capital by operating area; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to acquisition accounting, including controls over the valuation of proved and unproved natural gas and oil properties acquired. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the purchase agreement; (ii) testing management s process for developing the fair value estimate of proved and unproved natural gas and oil properties acquired; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models; (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the discounted cash flow models; and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant inputs used by management related to recoverable reserves, production rates, future operating and development costs, future commodity prices escalated by an inflationary rate after five years, adjusted for differentials, and a market-based weighted average cost of capital by operating area. Evaluating the reasonableness of management s significant inputs related to future commodity prices escalated by an inflationary rate after five years, adjusted for differentials, involved comparing the prices against observable market data and evaluating differentials through inspection of the underlying contracts. Evaluating future operating and development costs involved evaluating the reasonableness of the costs as compared to the past performance of the acquired business, comparing to the current performance of the Company, consistency with external market and industry data, and whether the significant inputs were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. The work of management s specialists was used in performing procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the recoverable reserves and production rates used in the discounted cash flow models. As a basis for using this work, the specialists qualifications were understood and the Company s relationship with the specialists was assessed. The procedures performed also included evaluating the methods and assumptions used by the specialists, testing the

of the voting shares of the Company outstanding following its emergence from bankruptcy and (ii) the reorganization value of our assets immediately prior to confirmation of the Plan of approximately billion was less than the post-petition liabilities and allowed claims of billion. 
 In accordance with ASC 852, with the application of fresh start accounting, the Company allocated its reorganization value to its individual assets based on their estimated fair value in conformity with FASB ASC Topic 820 - Fair Value Measurements and FASB ASC Topic 805 - Business Combinations . Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements after February 9, 2021 are not comparable with the consolidated financial statements as of or prior to that date. The Effective Date fair values of the Successor s assets and liabilities differ materially from their recorded values, as reflected on the historical balance sheet of the Predecessor. 
 Reorganization Value 
 Reorganization value is derived from an estimate of enterprise value, or fair value of the Company s interest-bearing debt and stockholders equity. Under ASC 852, reorganization value generally approximates fair value of the entity before considering liabilities and is intended to approximate the amount a willing buyer would pay for the assets immediately after the effects of a restructuring. As set forth in the disclosure statement, amended for updated pricing, and approved by the Bankruptcy Court, the enterprise value of the Successor was estimated to be between billion and billion. With the assistance of third-party valuation advisors, we determined the enterprise value and corresponding implied equity value of the Successor using various valuation approaches and methods, including: (i) income approach using a calculation of present value of future cash flows based on our financial projections, (ii) the market approach using selling prices of similar assets and (iii) the cost approach. For GAAP purposes, the Company valued the Successor s individual assets, liabilities and equity instruments and determined an estimate of the enterprise value within the estimated range. Management concluded that the best estimate of enterprise value was billion. Specific valuation approaches and key assumptions used to arrive at reorganization value, and the value of discrete assets and liabilities resulting from the application of fresh start accounting, are described below in greater detail within the valuation process. 
 The enterprise value and corresponding implied equity value are dependent upon achieving the future financial results set forth in our valuation using an asset-based methodology of estimated proved reserves, undeveloped properties, and other financial information, considerations and projections, applying a combination of the income, cost and market approaches as of the fresh start reporting date of February 9, 2021. All estimates, assumptions, valuations and financial projections, including the fair value adjustments, the financial projections, the enterprise value and equity value projections, are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and the resolution of contingencies beyond our control. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the estimates, assumptions, valuations or financial projections will be realized, and actual results could vary materially.

 Valuation Process 
 The fair values of our natural gas and oil properties, other property and equipment, other long-term assets, long-term debt, asset retirement obligations and warrants were estimated as of the Effective Date. 
 Natural gas and oil properties. The Company s principal assets are its natural gas and oil properties, which are accounted for under the successful efforts accounting method. The Company determined the fair value of its natural gas and oil properties based on the discounted future net cash flows expected to be generated from these assets. Discounted cash flow models by operating area were prepared using the estimated future revenues and operating costs for all proved developed properties and undeveloped properties comprising the proved and unproved reserves. Significant inputs associated with the calculation of discounted future net cash flows include estimates of (i) recoverable reserves, (ii) production rates, (iii) future operating and development costs, (iv) future commodity prices escalated by an inflationary rate after five years, adjusted for differentials, and (v) a market-based weighted average cost of capital by operating area. The Company utilized NYMEX strip pricing, adjusted for differentials, to value the reserves. The NYMEX strip pricing inputs used are classified as Level 1 fair value assumptions and all other inputs are classified as Level 3 fair value assumptions. The discount rates utilized were derived using a weighted average cost of capital computation, which included an estimated cost of debt and equity for market participants with similar geographies and asset development type by operating area. 
 Other property and equipment. The fair value of other property and equipment such as buildings, land, computer equipment, and other equipment was determined using the replacement cost method under the cost approach which considers historical acquisition costs for the assets adjusted for inflation, as well as factors in any potential obsolescence based on the current condition of the assets and the ability of those assets to generate cash flow. 
 Long-term debt. A market approach, based upon quotes from major financial institutions, was used to measure the fair value of the million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes and million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2029 (the 2029 Notes and, together with the 2026 Notes, the Notes ). The carrying value of borrowings under our Exit Credit Facility approximated fair value as the terms and interest rates were based on prevailing market rates. 
 Asset retirement obligations. The fair value of the Company s asset retirement obligations was revalued based upon estimated reclamation costs for our assets with reclamation obligations, an appropriate long-term inflation adjustment, and our revised credit adjusted risk-free rate. The credit adjusted risk-free rate was based on an evaluation of an interest rate that equates to a risk-free interest rate adjusted for the effect of our credit standing.

Natural Gas and Oil Properties 
 For the Marcellus Acquisition, we applied applicable guidance, under which an acquirer should recognize the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed on the acquisition date at fair value. The fair value estimate of proved and unproved natural gas and oil properties as of the acquisition date was based on estimated natural gas and oil reserves and related future net cash flows discounted using a weighted average cost of capital, including estimates of future production rates and future development costs. We utilized NYMEX strip pricing adjusted for inflation to value the reserves. We then applied various discount rates depending on the classification of reserves and other risk characteristics. Management utilized the assistance of a third-party valuation expert to estimate the value of the natural gas and oil properties acquired. Additionally, the fair value estimate of proved and unproved natural gas and oil properties was corroborated by utilizing a market approach, which considers recent comparable transactions for similar assets. 
 The inputs used to value natural gas and oil properties require significant judgment and estimates made by management and represent Level 3 inputs. 
 Marcellus Acquisition Revenues and Expenses Subsequent to Acquisition 
 We included in our consolidated statements of operations natural gas, oil and NGL revenues of million, marketing revenues of million, net losses on natural gas and oil derivatives of million, and direct operating expenses of million, including depreciation, depletion and amortization, related to the Marcellus Acquisition businesses for the period from March 10, 2022 (the date immediately following the completion of the Marcellus Acquisition) through December 31, 2022. 
 Vine Acquisition 
 On November 1, 2021, we acquired Vine, an energy company focused on the development of natural gas properties in the over-pressured stacked Haynesville and Mid-Bossier shale plays in Northwest Louisiana pursuant to a definitive agreement with Vine dated August 10, 2021, for total consideration of approximately billion, consisting of approximately million shares of our common stock and million in cash. In conjunction with the Vine Acquisition, Vine s Second Lien Term Loan was repaid and terminated for million inclusive of a million make whole premium with cash on hand due to the agreement containing a change in control provision making the term loan callable upon closing. Vine s reserve-based loan facility, which had borrowings as of November 1, 2021, was terminated at the time of the acquisition. Additionally, Vine s Senior Notes, with a principal amount of million were assumed by the Company. See Note 6 for additional discussion of the assumed debt.

 We had the option to settle conversions of the convertible senior notes due 2026 with cash, shares or common stock or any combination thereof. As the price of our common stock was below the conversion threshold level for any time during the conversion period, there was no impact to diluted earnings (loss) per share.

 New Credit Facility. In December 2022, we entered into a senior secured reserve-based credit agreement (the New Credit Agreement with the lenders and issuing banks party thereto (the Lenders ), and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent (in such capacity, the Administrative Agent ), providing for a reserve-based credit facility (the New Credit Facility with an initial borrowing base of billion and aggregate commitments of billion. The New Credit Facility matures in December 2027. The New Credit Facility provides for a million sublimit available for the issuance of letters of credit and a million sublimit available for swingline loans. 
 
 Initially, the obligations under the New Credit Facility are guaranteed by certain of Chesapeake s subsidiaries (the Guarantors ), and the New Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets owned by the Company and the Guarantors (subject to customary exceptions), including mortgages on not less than of the total PV-9 of the borrowing base properties evaluated in the most recent reserve report (where PV-9 is the net present value, discounted at per annum, of the estimated future net revenues). The borrowing base will be redetermined semi-annually on or around April 15 and October 15 of each year, with one interim wildcard redetermination available to each of the Company and the Administrative Agent, the latter at the direction of the Required Lenders (as defined in the New Credit Agreement), between scheduled redeterminations. The next scheduled redetermination will be on or about April 15, 2023. The New Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants that limit Chesapeake and its subsidiaries ability to, among other things but subject to exceptions customary to reserve-based credit facilities: (i) incur additional indebtedness, (ii) make investments, (iii) enter into mergers; (iv) make or declare dividends; (v) repurchase or redeem certain indebtedness; (vi) enter into certain hedges; (vii) incur liens; (viii) sell assets; and (ix) engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The New Credit Agreement requires Chesapeake to maintain compliance with the following financial ratios Financial Covenants beginning with the first quarter of 2023: (A) a current ratio, which is the ratio of Chesapeake s and its restricted subsidiaries consolidated current assets (including unused commitments under the New Credit Facility but excluding certain non-cash assets) to their consolidated current liabilities (excluding the current portion of long-term debt and certain non-cash liabilities), of not less than to 1.00; (B) a net leverage ratio, which is the ratio of total indebtedness (less unrestricted cash up to a specified threshold) to Consolidated EBITDAX (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters, of not greater than to 1.00 and (C) a PV-9 coverage ratio of the net present value, discounted at per annum, of the estimated future net revenues expected in the proved reserves to Chesapeake s and its restricted subsidiaries total indebtedness of not less than to 1.00 PV-9 Coverage Ratio ). 
 
 Borrowings under the New Credit Agreement may be alternate base rate loans or term SOFR loans, at our election. Interest is payable quarterly for alternate base rate loans and at the end of the applicable interest period for term SOFR loa ns. Term SOFR loans bear interest at term SOFR plus an applicable rate ranging from to basis points per annum, depending on the percentage of the commitments utilized, plus an additional basis points per annum credit spread adjustment. Alternate base rate loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greatest of: (i) the prime rate; (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus basis points; and (iii) the adjusted term SOFR rate for a one-month interest period plus basis points, plus an applicable margin ranging from to basis points per annum, depending on the percentage of the commitments utilized. Chesapeake also pays a commitment fee on unused commitment amounts under the Credit Facility ranging from to basis points per annum, depending on the percentage of the commitments utilized.

 billion. The aggregate initial elected commitments of the lenders under the Exit Credit Facility were billion of Tranche A Loans and million of fully funded Tranche B Loans. 
 The Exit Credit Facility provided for a million sublimit of the aggregate commitments that was available for the issuance of letters of credit. The Exit Credit Facility bore interest at the ABR (alternate base rate) or LIBOR, at our election, plus an applicable margin (ranging from per annum for ABR loans and per annum for LIBOR loans, subject to a LIBOR floor), depending on the percentage of the borrowing base then being utilized. The Tranche A Loans were due to mature after the Effective Date and the Tranche B Loans were due to mature after the Effective Date. The Company was required to pay a commitment fee of per annum on the average daily unused portion of the current aggregate commitments under the Tranche A Loans. 
 The Credit Agreement was subject to various financial and other covenants and also contained customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other things, as to compliance with laws (including environmental laws and anti-corruption laws), delivery of quarterly and annual financial statements, conduct of business, maintenance of property, maintenance of insurance, restrictions on the incurrence of liens, indebtedness, asset dispositions, fundamental changes, restricted payments, and other customary covenants. In December 2022, the Tranche A Loans and Tranche B Loans were both repaid and the Exit Credit Facility was terminated. 
 Borrowings under our credit agreements bore interest at an average interest rate of during the 2022 Successor Period. The Company has additional secured debt outstanding as of December 31, 2022. 
 Outstanding Senior Notes. On February 2, 2021, Chesapeake Escrow Issuer LLC, then an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, issued million aggregate principal amount of its 2026 Notes and million aggregate principal amount of its 2029 Notes. The Notes included a million premium to reflect fair value adjustments at the date of emergence. 
 The Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Company s subsidiaries that guaranteed the Exit Credit Facility. 
 The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of February 5, 2021, among the Issuer, the guarantor party thereto and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee. 
 Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually, on February 1 and August 1 of each year to holders of record on the immediately preceding January 15 and July 15.

 We recognize certain permanent book-to-tax differences relating to reorganization items such as differences in the treatment of the extinguishment of liabilities, differences due to the non-deductibility of certain expenses associated with administering the plan of reorganization, and the adjustment to deferred tax assets which are subject to expiration before they are utilizable. In the Successor Period, we recognized a difference due to the non-deductibility of certain transaction costs and other post-combination expenses. Our state income tax provision can fluctuate as a result of changing state apportionment factors and state tax rates. The 2021 Successor Period resulted in a state tax benefit before valuation allowance. The shift of our state profile towards a higher overall state tax rate as a consequence of the Vine Acquisition caused an increase to our state deferred tax assets. Such increase was offset in full by an increase to our valuation allowance. The Marcellus Acquisition during the 2022 Successor Period resulted in a similar, but lessened effect. 
 Deferred income taxes are provided to reflect temporary differences in the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.

 As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, we had deferred tax assets of billion and billion, respectively, upon which we had a valuation allowance of million and billion, respectively. Of the net change in the valuation allowance of billion, billion was attributable to the valuation allowance release during the fourth quarter of 2022 and million was associated primarily with pre-tax income for the year. 
 A valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, including NOL carryforwards and disallowed business interest carryforwards, is recognized when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit from the deferred tax assets will not be realized. To assess that likelihood, we use estimates and judgment regarding our future taxable income, and we consider the tax consequences in the jurisdiction where such taxable income is generated, to determine whether a valuation allowance is required. Such evidence can include our current financial position, our results of operations, both actual and forecasted, the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, as well as the current and forecasted business economics of our industry. Management assesses all available evidence, both positive and negative, to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of deferred tax assets. 
 
 For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based upon the conclusion that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would not be realized. An item of negative evidence consisted of the cumulative pre-tax book losses over rolling three-year periods, primarily due to recurring operational losses and billion of impairments of proved natural gas and oil properties recorded in the quarter ended March 31, 2020 (see Note 19 ). For the cumulative three-year period ended December 31, 2022, we are in a cumulative loss position, but given the magnitude of the 2020 losses rolling off relative to the 2021 and 2022 positive pre-tax book income, we anticipate a return to cumulative pre-tax income during 2023. The expectation of future earnings along with reversals of existing taxable timing differences provide us with sufficient positive evidence to conclude that billion of our federal and state deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. Accordingly, we have released the valuation allowance for this amount during 2022. We continue to maintain a partial valuation allowance of million against the portion of our federal and state deferred tax assets such as NOLs, credit carryovers, and capital losses, which may expire before we are able to utilize those due to the application of the limitations under Section 382 and the ordering in which such attributes may be applied.

 million. The limitation applies to our NOL carryforwards, disallowed business interest carryforwards and general business credits until such attributes expire or are fully utilized. As we were in an overall net unrealized built-in loss position at the Effective Date, the limitation also applies to any recognized built-in losses incurred for a period of five years but only to the extent of the overall net unrealized built-in loss. Recognized built-in losses include a portion of our tax depreciation, depletion, and amortization deductions along with a portion of our realized hedging losses. We incurred sufficient recognized built-in losses during the 2021 tax year such that we have no further restriction on the company s deduction for such items. Some states impose similar limitations on tax attribute utilization upon experiencing an Ownership Change. 
 In Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases, the cancellation of debt income CODI realized upon emergence from bankruptcy is excludible from taxable income but results in a reduction of tax attributes in accordance with the attribute reduction and ordering rules of Section 108 of the Code. The amount of our CODI was billion, all of which reduced our NOL carryforwards. As a result of the Section 382 limitation, million of federal NOLs remaining after the CODI reduction were estimated to expire before they would become utilizable and, as such, were removed from our deferred tax assets. The states we operate in generally have similar rules for attribute reduction and Section 382 limitation which resulted in the reduction of certain of our state NOL carryforwards. 
 On November 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Vine. For federal income tax purposes, the transaction qualified as a tax-free merger under Section 368 of the Code and, as a result, we acquired carryover tax basis in Vine s assets and liabilities. In the 2021 Successor Period, we recorded a million net deferred tax liability determined through business combination accounting. Upon the completion of Vine s tax returns in the 2022 Successor Period, the net deferred tax liability was adjusted to million. As a result of this adjustment to the deferred tax liability, we increased our valuation allowance and recorded million of income tax expense in the 2022 Successor Period. Additionally, we acquired NOL and interest expense carryforwards which are subject to a base annual Section 382 limitation of approximately million. The base annual limitation is estimated to be increased over the first five years for recognized built-in gains of approximately million per year resulting in approximately million per year of available utilization in those years. 
 The Marcellus Acquisition during the 2022 Successor Period was treated as a taxable asset acquisition with no tax carryovers acquired. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we have an income tax receivable of million included in other current assets within our consolidated balance sheets.

 We had state NOL carryforwards of approximately billion. Several states adopt the federal NOL carryforward period such that our more recent state NOLs do not expire. The state NOL carryforwards are subject to apportioned amounts of the federal Section 382 limitations. 
 On August 16, 2022, the President of the United States signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA which, among other things, includes provisions for a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax on book income for companies whose average book income exceeds 1 billion for any three consecutive years preceding the tax year and a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks. These changes are generally in effect for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. Based on our book income in the past three years, we do not believe we will be subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax in 2023. However, we may become subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax in future years. It is our policy that we view the alternative minimum tax as an excess tax over regular income tax and therefore, our deferred tax assets will continue to be assessed for realizability on the basis of whether they reduce a regular tax liability. Should we pay alternative minimum tax in the future and thus acquire credit carryovers related thereto, such deferred tax assets on these will be separately evaluated for valuation allowance purposes. 
 Accounting guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions requires a more likely than not threshold condition be met on a tax position, based solely on the technical merits of being sustained, before any benefit of the tax position can be recognized in the financial statements. Guidance is also provided regarding recognition, classification and disclosure of uncertain tax positions. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to NOL carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards, and tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was million and million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, million is related to state tax receivables not expected to be recovered, million is related to tax credit carryforwards, and the remainder is related to NOL carryforwards. As of December 31, 2021, million is related to state tax receivables not expected to be recovered and the remainder is related to NOL carryforwards. If recognized, million of the uncertain tax positions identified would have an effect on the effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, we had no amounts accrued for interest related to these uncertain tax positions. We recognize interest related to uncertain tax positions as a component of interest expense. Penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions would be recorded in other expenses. million of the state tax receivable relates to claims for refund of Pennsylvania income taxes. During the fourth quarter of 2021, a court case with similar claims as ours was decided in favor of the taxpayer. We considered this information and determined that we had no change to our assessment of the recognition and measurement of our position. Should the state exhaust its appeals so that the taxpayer ultimately prevails we may be successful in applying that precedent to our claims. As such, it is possible that we may reassess that refund claim in the next 12 months and ascertain it to be more likely than not to be sustained. Should this occur, we will record a current tax benefit and income tax receivable for the amount we determine we are likely to sustain.

See Note 2 3 for more details. 
 Natural Gas and Oil Derivatives 
 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our natural gas and oil derivative instruments consisted of the following types of instruments: 
 Swaps : We receive a fixed price and pay a floating market price to the counterparty for the hedged commodity. In exchange for higher fixed prices on certain of our swap trades, we may sell call options and swap options. 
 Options : We sell, and occasionally buy, call options in exchange for a premium. At the time of settlement, if the market price exceeds the fixed price of the call option, we pay the counterparty the excess on sold call options and we receive the excess on bought call options. If the market price settles below the fixed price of the call option, no payment is due from either party. 
 Collars : These instruments contain a fixed floor price (put) and ceiling price (call). If the market price exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price, we receive the fixed price and pay the market price. If the market price is between the put and the call strike prices, no payments are due from either party. Three-way collars include the sale by us of an additional put option in exchange for a more favorable strike price on the call option. This eliminates the counterparty s downside exposure below the second put option strike price. 
 Basis Protection Swaps : These instruments are arrangements that guarantee a fixed price differential to NYMEX from a specified delivery point. We receive the fixed price differential and pay the floating market price differential to the counterparty for the hedged commodity.

 Fair Value 
 The fair value of our derivatives is based on third-party pricing models, which utilize inputs that are either readily available in the public market, such as natural gas, oil and NGL forward curves and discount rates, or can be corroborated from active markets or broker quotes, and, as such, are classified as Level 2. These values are compared to the values given by our counterparties for reasonableness. Derivatives are also subject to the risk that either party to a contract will be unable to meet its obligations. We factor non-performance risk into the valuation of our derivatives using current published credit default swap rates. To date, this has not had a material impact on the values of our derivatives. 
 Credit Risk Considerations 
 Our derivative instruments expose us to our counterparties credit risk. To mitigate this risk, we enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are highly rated or deemed by us to have acceptable credit strength and deemed by management to be competent and competitive market-makers, and we attempt to limit our exposure to non-performance by any single counterparty. As of December 31, 2022, our natural gas and oil derivative instruments were spread among counterparties. 
 Hedging Arrangements 
 Certain of our hedging arrangements are with counterparties that were also lenders (or affiliates of lenders) under our New Credit Facility. The contracts entered into with these counterparties are secured by the same collateral that secures the revolving credit facility. The counterparties obligations must be secured by cash or letters of credit to the extent that any mark-to-market amounts owed to us exceed defined thresholds. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any cash or letters of credit posted as collateral for our commodity derivatives.

billion of impairments related to our natural gas and oil properties. In the 2020 Predecessor Period, the decrease in demand for crude oil primarily due to the combined impacts of COVID-19 and the OPEC+ production increases resulted in decreases in then current and then expected long-term crude oil and NGL sale prices. These conditions resulted in reductions to the market capitalization of peer companies in the energy industry. We determined these adverse market conditions represented a triggering event to perform an impairment assessment of our long-lived assets used in, and in support of, our operations, including proved natural gas and oil properties, and our sand mine assets. 
 
 Proved Gas and Oil Properties 
 Our impairment test involved a Step 1 assessment to determine if the net book value of our proved natural gas and oil properties was expected to be recovered from the estimated undiscounted future cash flows. 
 We calculated the expected undiscounted future net cash flows of our long-lived assets using management s assumptions and expectations of (i) commodity prices, which are based on the NYMEX strip pricing escalated by an inflationary rate (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials, (iii) operating costs, (iv) capital investment plans, (v) future production volumes, and (vi) estimated proved reserves. 
 
 Unprecedented volatility in the price of oil due to the decrease in demand led us to rely on NYMEX strip pricing, which represented a Level 1 input. 
 Certain natural gas and oil properties in our Eagle Ford , Powder River Basin, and Mid-Continent and other non-core operating areas failed the Step 1 assessment. For these assets, we used a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate fair value. The expected future net cash flows were discounted using a rate of , which we believe represents the estimated weighted average cost of capital of a theoretical market participant. Based on Step 2 of our long-lived assets impairment test, we recognized an billion impairment because the carrying value exceeded estimated fair market value as of March 31, 2020. 
 Significant inputs associated with the calculation of discounted future net cash flows include estimates of (i) recoverable reserves, (ii) production rates, (iii) future operating and development costs, (iv) future commodity prices escalated by an inflationary rate, adjusted for differentials, and (v) a market-based weighted average cost of capital. We utilized NYMEX strip pricing, adjusted for differentials, to value the reserves. The NYMEX strip pricing inputs used are classified as Level 1 fair value assumptions and all other inputs are classified as Level 3 fair value assumptions. 
 Impairments of Fixed Assets 
 In the 2020 Predecessor Period, we recorded a million impairment of our sand mine assets that support our Eagle Ford operating area for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the assets as well as a million impairment of compressor inventory due to a lack of a current market for compressors. 
 During the 2022 Successor Period, 2021 Successor Period and 2021 Predecessor Period, we did t have any material impairments of our natural gas and oil properties or fixed assets. 
 
 million were primarily the result of non-cash impairment charges in unproved properties of million, million of charges related to dry hole expense and million of geological and geophysical expense. We did not have material exploration expenses during the 2021 Successor Period or 2021 Predecessor Period. The exploration expense charges of million during the 2020 Predecessor Period were primarily the result of non-cash impairment charges in unproved properties of million, primarily in o ur Eagle Ford, Haynesville, Powder River Basin and Mid-Continent operating areas.

 Natural Gas, Oil and NGL Reserve Quantities 
 Our petroleum engineers and independent petroleum engineering firms estimated all of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Independent petroleum engineering firm Netherland, Sewell Associates, Inc. estimated an aggregate of of our estimated proved reserves (by volume) as of December 31, 2022. 
 Proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves are those quantities of natural gas, oil and NGL which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. Based on reserve reporting rules, the price is calculated using the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. A project to extract hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes: (i) the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and (ii) adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible natural gas or oil on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data. In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish a lower contact with reasonable certainty. Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated natural gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty. Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery

We recorded extensions and discoveries of bcfe following our emergence from bankruptcy on February 9, 2021, and certainty regarding our ability to finance the development of our proved reserves over a five-year period. We recorded bcfe of upward revisions of previous estimates, which consisted of bcfe due to lateral length adjustments, performance and updates to our five-year development plan and bcfe due to higher natural gas, oil and NGL prices in 2021. The natural gas, oil and NGL prices used in computing our reserves as of December 31, 2021, were per mcf, per bbl and per bbl, respectively, before basis differential adjustments. 
 During 2020, we recorded extensions and discoveries of bcfe primarily in the Marcellus and Haynesville primarily related to successfully drilled new well additions. We sold bcfe of proved reserves for approximately million primarily in the Mid-Continent. We recorded bcfe of downward revisions of previous estimates consisting of bcfe of downward revisions due to updates to our five-year development plan in contemplation of ongoing market conditions and uncertainty regarding our ability to finance the development of our proved reserves over a five-year period, downward revisions of bcfe due to lower natural gas, oil and NGL prices in 2020, and upward revisions of bcfe due to ongoing portfolio evaluation including performance adjustments. The natural gas, oil and NGL prices used in computing our reserves as of December 31, 2020, were per mcf, per bbl and per bbl, respectively, before basis differential adjustments. 
 Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows 
 Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932 prescribes guidelines for computing a standardized measure of future net cash flows and changes therein relating to estimated proved reserves. Chesapeake has followed these guidelines which are briefly discussed below. 
 Future cash inflows and future production and development costs as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were determined by applying the average of the first-day-of-the-month prices for the 12 months of the year and year-end costs to the estimated quantities of natural gas, oil and NGL to be produced. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs used. For each year, estimates are made of quantities of proved reserves and the future periods during which they are expected to be produced based on continuation of the economic conditions applied for that year. Estimated future income taxes are computed using current statutory income tax rates including consideration of the current tax basis of the properties and related carryforwards, giving effect to permanent differences and tax credits. The resulting future net cash flows are reduced to present value amounts by applying a 10 annual discount factor. 
 The assumptions used to compute the standardized measure are those prescribed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and do not necessarily reflect our expectations of actual revenue to be derived from those reserves nor their present worth. The limitations inherent in the reserve quantity estimation process, as discussed previously, are equally applicable to the standardized measure computations since these estimates reflect the valuation process.

 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 It is the responsibility of the management of Chesapeake Energy Corporation to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Management utilized the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission's Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) in conducting the required assessment of effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 Management has performed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and has determined the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which appears herein.

 Mr. Nick Penner 
 Chesapeake Energy Corporation 
 6100 North Western Avenue 
 Oklahoma City, OK 73118 
 
 Dear Mr. Penner 
 
 In accordance with your request, we have estimated the proved reserves and future revenue, as of December 31, 2022, to the Chesapeake Energy Corporation (Chesapeake) interest in certain oil and gas properties located in the United States. We completed our evaluation on or about the date of this letter. It is our understanding that the proved reserves estimated in this report constitute approximately 92.2 percent of all proved reserves owned by Chesapeake. The estimates in this report have been prepared in accordance with the definitions and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and, with the exception of the exclusion of future income taxes, conform to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Activities Oil and Gas. Definitions are presented immediately following this letter. This report has been prepared for Chesapeake's use in filing with the SEC in our opinion the assumptions, data, methods, and procedures used in the preparation of this report are appropriate for such purpose. 
 
 We estimate the net reserves and future net revenue to the Chesapeake interest in these properties, as of December 31, 2022, to be 
 
 Net Reserves Future Net Revenue (M Gas NGL Oil Present Worth Category (MMCF) (MBBL) (MBBL) Total at 10 Proved Developed Producing 6,926,825.9 54,022.7 150,055.6 41,738,653.7 22,074,507.1 Proved Undeveloped 3,830,669.2 0.0 0.0 15,199,196.0 8,816,181.6 Total Proved 10,757,495.1 54,022.7 150,055.6 56,937,849.7 30,890,688.8 
 
 Totals may not add because of rounding. 
 
 Gas volumes are expressed in millions of cubic feet (MMCF) at standard temperature and pressure bases. The oil volumes shown include crude oil and condensate. Oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) volumes are expressed in thousands of barrels (MBBL) a barrel is equivalent to 42 United States gallons. 
 
 Reserves categorization conveys the relative degree of certainty reserves subcategorization is based on development and production status. As requested, proved developed non-producing, probable, and possible reserves that may exist for these properties have not been included. The estimates of reserves and future revenue included herein have not been adjusted for risk. This report does not include any value that could be attributed to interests in undeveloped acreage beyond those tracts for which undeveloped reserves have been estimated. 
 
 Gross revenue is Chesapeake's share of the gross (100 percent) revenue from the properties prior to any deductions. Future net revenue is after deductions for Chesapeake's share of production taxes, ad valorem taxes, capital costs, abandonment costs, and operating expenses but before consideration of any income taxes. The future net revenue has been discounted at an annual rate of 10 percent to determine its present worth, which is shown to indicate the effect of time on the value of money. Future net revenue presented in this report, whether discounted or undiscounted, should not be construed as being the fair market value of the properties.

Prices used in this report are based on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month in the period January through December 2022. For gas volumes, the average Henry Hub spot price of 6.36 per MMBTU is adjusted for energy content, transportation fees, gathering fees, treating fees, and market differentials for certain properties, gas prices are negative after adjustments. For the Eagle Ford South Texas properties, the fees associated with Chesapeake's Minimum Volume Commitment contracts are not included at contract expiration, fees for gathering and treating, at current contract rates, are included in the gas price adjustments. For oil and NGL volumes, the average NYMEX West Texas Intermediate spot price of 93.67 per barrel is adjusted for quality, transportation fees, and market differentials. The average adjusted product prices weighted by production over the remaining lives of the properties are 5.022 per MCF of gas, 36.45 per barrel of NGL, and 92.72 per barrel of oil. 
 
 Operating costs used in this report are based on operating expense records of Chesapeake, the operator of the properties. As requested, operating costs are limited to direct lease- and field-level costs and Chesapeake's estimate of the portion of its headquarters general and administrative overhead expenses necessary to operate the properties. Operating costs have been divided into per-well costs and per-unit-of-production costs and are not escalated for inflation. 
 
 Capital costs used in this report were provided by Chesapeake and are based on authorizations for expenditure and actual costs from recent activity. Capital costs are included as required for tubing costs, new development wells, and production equipment. Based on our understanding of future development plans, a review of the records provided to us, and our knowledge of similar properties, we regard these estimated capital costs to be reasonable. Abandonment costs used in this report are Chesapeake's estimates of the costs to abandon the wells and production facilities, net of any salvage value. Capital costs and abandonment costs are not escalated for future inflation. 
 
 For the purposes of this report, we did not perform any field inspection of the properties, nor did we examine the mechanical operation or condition of the wells and facilities. We have not investigated possible environmental liability related to the properties therefore, our estimates do not include any costs due to such possible liability. 
 
 We have made no investigation of potential volume and value imbalances resulting from overdelivery or underdelivery to the Chesapeake interest. Therefore, our estimates of reserves and future revenue do not include adjustments for the settlement of any such imbalances our projections are based on Chesapeake receiving its net revenue interest share of estimated future gross production. 
 
 The reserves shown in this report are estimates only and should not be construed as exact quantities. Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of engineering and geoscience data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible probable and possible reserves are those additional reserves which are sequentially less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. Estimates of reserves may increase or decrease as a result of market conditions, future operations, changes in regulations, or actual reservoir performance. In addition to the primary economic assumptions discussed herein, our estimates are based on certain assumptions including, but not limited to, that the properties will be developed consistent with current development plans as provided to us by Chesapeake, that the properties will be operated in a prudent manner, that no governmental regulations or controls will be put in place that would impact the ability of the interest owner to recover the reserves, and that our projections of future production will prove consistent with actual performance. If the reserves are recovered, the revenues therefrom and the costs related thereto could be more or less than the estimated amounts. Because of governmental policies and uncertainties of supply and demand, the sales rates, prices received for the reserves, and costs incurred in recovering such reserves may vary from assumptions made while preparing this report. 
 
 For the purposes of this report, we used technical and economic data including, but not limited to, well logs, geologic maps, well test data, production data, historical price and cost information, and property ownership interests. The reserves in this report have been estimated using deterministic methods these estimates have been prepared in accordance with the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information 

promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE Standards). We used standard engineering and geoscience methods, or a combination of methods, including performance analysis, volumetric analysis, and analogy, that we considered to be appropriate and necessary to categorize and estimate reserves in accordance with SEC definitions and regulations. As in all aspects of oil and gas evaluation, there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of engineering and geoscience data therefore, our conclusions necessarily represent only informed professional judgment. 
 
 The data used in our estimates were obtained from Chesapeake, public data sources, and the nonconfidential files of Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (NSAI) and were accepted as accurate. Supporting work data are on file in our office. We have not examined the titles to the properties or independently confirmed the actual degree or type of interest owned. The technical persons primarily responsible for preparing the estimates presented herein meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity, and confidentiality set forth in the SPE Standards. James D. Berry, a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas, has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering at NSAI since 2014 and has over 6 years of prior industry experience. William J. Knights, a Licensed Professional Geoscientist in the State of Texas, has been practicing consulting petroleum geoscience at NSAI since 1991 and has over 10 years of prior industry experience. We are independent petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists, and petrophysicists we do not own an interest in these properties nor are we employed on a contingent basis.

DEFINITIONS OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES 
 Adapted from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Section 210.4-10(a) 

 The following definitions are set forth in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation S-X Section 210.4-10(a). Also included is supplemental information from (1) the 2018 Petroleum Resources Management System approved by the Society of Petroleum Engineers, (2) the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Activities Oil and Gas, and (3) the SEC's Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations. 
 
 (1) Acquisition of properties. Costs incurred to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire a property, including costs of lease bonuses and options to purchase or lease properties, the portion of costs applicable to minerals when land including mineral rights is purchased in fee, brokers' fees, recording fees, legal costs, and other costs incurred in acquiring properties. 
 
 (2) Analogous reservoir . Analogous reservoirs, as used in resources assessments, have similar rock and fluid properties, reservoir conditions (depth, temperature, and pressure) and drive mechanisms, but are typically at a more advanced stage of development than the reservoir of interest and thus may provide concepts to assist in the interpretation of more limited data and estimation of recovery. When used to support proved reserves, an analogous reservoir refers to a reservoir that shares the following characteristics with the reservoir of interest 
 (i) Same geological formation (but not necessarily in pressure communication with the reservoir of interest) 
 (ii) Same environment of deposition 
 (iii) Similar geological structure and 
 (iv) Same drive mechanism. 
 
 Instruction to paragraph (a)(2) Reservoir properties must, in the aggregate, be no more favorable in the analog than in the reservoir of interest. 
 
 (3) Bitumen . Bitumen, sometimes referred to as natural bitumen, is petroleum in a solid or semi-solid state in natural deposits with a viscosity greater than 10,000 centipoise measured at original temperature in the deposit and atmospheric pressure, on a gas free basis. In its natural state it usually contains sulfur, metals, and other non-hydrocarbons. 
 
 (4) Condensate . Condensate is a mixture of hydrocarbons that exists in the gaseous phase at original reservoir temperature and pressure, but that, when produced, is in the liquid phase at surface pressure and temperature. 
 
 (5) Deterministic estimate . The method of estimating reserves or resources is called deterministic when a single value for each parameter (from the geoscience, engineering, or economic data) in the reserves calculation is used in the reserves estimation procedure. 
 
 (6) Developed oil and gas reserves . Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered 
 (i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well and (ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. 
 Supplemental definitions from the 2018 Petroleum Resources Management System 
 Developed Producing Reserves Expected quantities to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and producing at the effective date of the estimate. Improved recovery Reserves are considered producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation. 
 Developed Non-Producing Reserves Shut-in and behind-pipe Reserves. Shut-in Reserves are expected to be recovered from (1) completion intervals that are open at the time of the estimate but which have not yet started producing, (2) wells which were shut-in for market conditions or pipeline connections, or (3) wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons. Behind-pipe Reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells that will require additional completion work or future re-completion before start of production with minor cost to access these reserves. In all cases, production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of drilling a new well. 
 
 (7) Development costs. Costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves and to provide facilities for extracting, treating, gathering and storing the oil and gas. More specifically, development costs, including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of development activities, are costs incurred to 
 (i) Gain access to and prepare well locations for drilling, including surveying well locations for the purpose of determining specific development drilling sites, clearing ground, draining, road building, and relocating public roads, gas lines, and power lines, to the extent necessary in developing the proved reserves. (ii) Drill and equip development wells, development-type stratigraphic test wells, and service wells, including the costs of platforms and of well equipment such as casing, tubing, pumping equipment, and the wellhead assembly. 
 Definitions - Page 1 of 6 

DEFINITIONS OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES 
 Adapted from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Section 210.4-10(a) 

 (iii) Acquire, construct, and install production facilities such as lease flow lines, separators, treaters, heaters, manifolds, measuring devices, and production storage tanks, natural gas cycling and processing plants, and central utility and waste disposal systems. (iv) Provide improved recovery systems. 
 (8) Development project . A development project is the means by which petroleum resources are brought to the status of economically producible. As examples, the development of a single reservoir or field, an incremental development in a producing field, or the integrated development of a group of several fields and associated facilities with a common ownership may constitute a development project. 
 
 (9) Development well . A well drilled within the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. 
 
 (10) Economically producible . The term economically producible, as it relates to a resource, means a resource which generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably expected to exceed, the costs of the operation. The value of the products that generate revenue shall be determined at the terminal point of oil and gas producing activities as defined in paragraph (a)(16) of this section. 
 
 (11) Estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) . Estimated ultimate recovery is the sum of reserves remaining as of a given date and cumulative production as of that date. 
 
 (12) Exploration costs . Costs incurred in identifying areas that may warrant examination and in examining specific areas that are considered to have prospects of containing oil and gas reserves, including costs of drilling exploratory wells and exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells. Exploration costs may be incurred both before acquiring the related property (sometimes referred to in part as prospecting costs) and after acquiring the property. Principal types of exploration costs, which include depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of exploration activities, are 
 (i) Costs of topographical, geographical and geophysical studies, rights of access to properties to conduct those studies, and salaries and other expenses of geologists, geophysical crews, and others conducting those studies. Collectively, these are sometimes referred to as geological and geophysical or G costs. (ii) Costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties, such as delay rentals, ad valorem taxes on properties, legal costs for title defense, and the maintenance of land and lease records. (iii) Dry hole contributions and bottom hole contributions. (iv) Costs of drilling and equipping exploratory wells. (v) Costs of drilling exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells. 
 (13) Exploratory well . An exploratory well is a well drilled to find a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or gas in another reservoir. Generally, an exploratory well is any well that is not a development well, an extension well, a service well, or a stratigraphic test well as those items are defined in this section. 
 
 (14) Extension well . An extension well is a well drilled to extend the limits of a known reservoir. 
 
 (15) Field . An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on or related to the same individual geological structural feature and or stratigraphic condition. There may be two or more reservoirs in a field which are separated vertically by intervening impervious strata, or laterally by local geologic barriers, or by both. Reservoirs that are associated by being in overlapping or adjacent fields may be treated as a single or common operational field. The geological terms structural feature and stratigraphic condition are intended to identify localized geological features as opposed to the broader terms of basins, trends, provinces, plays, areas-of-interest, etc. 
 
 (16) Oil and gas producing activities . 
 (i) Oil and gas producing activities include 
 (A) The search for crude oil, including condensate and natural gas liquids, or natural gas oil and gas in their natural states and original locations (B) The acquisition of property rights or properties for the purpose of further exploration or for the purpose of removing the oil or gas from such properties (C) The construction, drilling, and production activities necessary to retrieve oil and gas from their natural reservoirs, including the acquisition, construction, installation, and maintenance of field gathering and storage systems, such as 
 (1) Lifting the oil and gas to the surface and (2) Gathering, treating, and field processing (as in the case of processing gas to extract liquid hydrocarbons) and 
 Definitions - Page 2 of 6 

DEFINITIONS OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES 
 Adapted from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Section 210.4-10(a) 

 (D) Extraction of saleable hydrocarbons, in the solid, liquid, or gaseous state, from oil sands, shale, coalbeds, or other nonrenewable natural resources which are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas, and activities undertaken with a view to such extraction. 
 Instruction 1 to paragraph (a)(16)(i) The oil and gas production function shall be regarded as ending at a terminal point , which is the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank. If unusual physical or operational circumstances exist, it may be appropriate to regard the terminal point for the production function as 
 
 a. The first point at which oil, gas, or gas liquids, natural or synthetic, are delivered to a main pipeline, a common carrier, a refinery, or a marine terminal and 
 b. In the case of natural resources that are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas, if those natural resources are delivered to a purchaser prior to upgrading, the first point at which the natural resources are delivered to a main pipeline, a common carrier, a refinery, a marine terminal, or a facility which upgrades such natural resources into synthetic oil or gas. 
 
 Instruction 2 to paragraph (a)(16)(i) For purposes of this paragraph (a)(16), the term saleable hydrocarbons means hydrocarbons that are saleable in the state in which the hydrocarbons are delivered. 
 (ii) Oil and gas producing activities do not include (A) Transporting, refining, or marketing oil and gas (B) Processing of produced oil, gas, or natural resources that can be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas by a registrant that does not have the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in such production (C) Activities relating to the production of natural resources other than oil, gas, or natural resources from which synthetic oil and gas can be extracted or (D) Production of geothermal steam. 
 (17) Possible reserves. Possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves. 
 (i) When deterministic methods are used, the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 10 probability that the total quantities ultimately recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates. 
 (ii) Possible reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to probable reserves where data control and interpretations of available data are progressively less certain. Frequently, this will be in areas where geoscience and engineering data are unable to define clearly the area and vertical limits of commercial production from the reservoir by a defined project. (iii) Possible reserves also include incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than the recovery quantities assumed for probable reserves. 
 (iv) The proved plus probable and proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates must be based on reasonable alternative technical and commercial interpretations within the reservoir or subject project that are clearly documented, including comparisons to results in successful similar projects. (v) Possible reserves may be assigned where geoscience and engineering data identify directly adjacent portions of a reservoir within the same accumulation that may be separated from proved areas by faults with displacement less than formation thickness or other geological discontinuities and that have not been penetrated by a wellbore, and the registrant believes that such adjacent portions are in communication with the known (proved) reservoir. Possible reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher or lower than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir. 
 (vi) Pursuant to paragraph (a)(22)(iii) of this section, where direct observation has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves should be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir above the HKO only if the higher contact can be established with reasonable certainty through reliable technology. Portions of the reservoir that do not meet this reasonable certainty criterion may be assigned as probable and possible oil or gas based on reservoir fluid properties and pressure gradient interpretations. 
 
 (18) Probable reserves. Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. 
 (i) When deterministic methods are used, it is as likely as not that actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50 probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable reserves estimates. 
 
 Definitions - Page 3 of 6 

DEFINITIONS OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES 
 Adapted from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Section 210.4-10(a) 

 (ii) Probable reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to proved reserves where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain, even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonable certainty criterion. Probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir. 
 (iii) Probable reserves estimates also include potential incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves. 
 (iv) See also guidelines in paragraphs (a)(17)(iv) and (a)(17)(vi) of this section. 
 
 (19) Probabilistic estimate. The method of estimation of reserves or resources is called probabilistic when the full range of values that could reasonably occur for each unknown parameter (from the geoscience and engineering data) is used to generate a full range of possible outcomes and their associated probabilities of occurrence. 
 
 (20) Production costs . 
 (i) Costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and related equipment and facilities, including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of operating and maintaining those wells and related equipment and facilities. They become part of the cost of oil and gas produced. Examples of production costs (sometimes called lifting costs) are 
 (A) Costs of labor to operate the wells and related equipment and facilities. 
 (B) Repairs and maintenance. 
 (C) Materials, supplies, and fuel consumed and supplies utilized in operating the wells and related equipment and facilities. 
 (D) Property taxes and insurance applicable to proved properties and wells and related equipment and facilities. 
 (E) Severance taxes. 
 (ii) Some support equipment or facilities may serve two or more oil and gas producing activities and may also serve transportation, refining, and marketing activities. To the extent that the support equipment and facilities are used in oil and gas producing activities, their depreciation and applicable operating costs become exploration, development or production costs, as appropriate. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization of capitalized acquisition, exploration, and development costs are not production costs but also become part of the cost of oil and gas produced along with production (lifting) costs identified above. 
 
 (21) Proved area. The part of a property to which proved reserves have been specifically attributed. 
 
 (22) Proved oil and gas reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. 
 (i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes 
 (A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and 
 (B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data. 
 (ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty. 
 (iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty. 
 (iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when 
 (A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and 
 
 Definitions - Page 4 of 6 

DEFINITIONS OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES 
 Adapted from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Section 210.4-10(a) 

 (B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities. 
 (v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. 
 
 (23) Proved properties. Properties with proved reserves. 
 
 (24) Reasonable certainty. If deterministic methods are used, reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 90 probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. A high degree of confidence exists if the quantity is much more likely to be achieved than not, and, as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease. 
 
 (25) Reliable technology. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. 
 
 (26) Reserves. Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project. 
 
 Note to paragraph (a)(26) Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir (i.e., absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results). Such areas may contain prospective resources (i.e., potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations).

 932-235-50-30 A standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to an entity's interests in both of the following shall be disclosed as of the end of the year 
 a. Proved oil and gas reserves (see paragraphs 932-235-50-3 through 50-11B) 
 b. Oil and gas subject to purchase under long-term supply, purchase, or similar agreements and contracts in which the entity participates in the operation of the properties on which the oil or gas is located or otherwise serves as the producer of those reserves (see paragraph 932-235-50-7). 
 The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to those two types of interests in reserves may be combined for reporting purposes. 
 932-235-50-31 All of the following information shall be disclosed in the aggregate and for each geographic area for which reserve quantities are disclosed in accordance with paragraphs 932-235-50-3 through 50-11B 
 a. Future cash inflows. These shall be computed by applying prices used in estimating the entity's proved oil and gas reserves to the year-end quantities of those reserves. Future price changes shall be considered only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements in existence at year-end 
 b. Future development and production costs. These costs shall be computed by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the year, based on year-end costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions. If estimated development expenditures are significant, they shall be presented separately from estimated production costs. 
 c. Future income tax expenses. These expenses shall be computed by applying the appropriate year-end statutory tax rates, with consideration of future tax rates already legislated, to the future pretax net cash flows relating to the entity's proved oil and gas reserves, less the tax basis of the properties involved. The future income tax expenses shall give effect to tax deductions and tax credits and allowances relating to the entity's proved oil and gas reserves. 
 d. Future net cash flows. These amounts are the result of subtracting future development and production costs and future income tax expenses from future cash inflows.

 Adapted from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Section 210.4-10(a) 

 e. Discount. This amount shall be derived from using a discount rate of 10 percent a year to reflect the timing of the future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves. 
 f. Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. This amount is the future net cash flows less the computed discount. 
 
 (27) Reservoir. A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible oil and or gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs. 
 
 (28) Resources. Resources are quantities of oil and gas estimated to exist in naturally occurring accumulations. A portion of the resources may be estimated to be recoverable, and another portion may be considered to be unrecoverable. Resources include both discovered and undiscovered accumulations. 
 
 (29) Service well. A well drilled or completed for the purpose of supporting production in an existing field. Specific purposes of service wells include gas injection, water injection, steam injection, air injection, salt-water disposal, water supply for injection, observation, or injection for in-situ combustion. 
 
 (30) Stratigraphic test well. A stratigraphic test well is a drilling effort, geologically directed, to obtain information pertaining to a specific geologic condition. Such wells customarily are drilled without the intent of being completed for hydrocarbon production. The classification also includes tests identified as core tests and all types of expendable holes related to hydrocarbon exploration. Stratigraphic tests are classified as exploratory type if not drilled in a known area or development type if drilled in a known area. 
 
 (31) Undeveloped oil and gas reserves. Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. 
 (i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. 
 (ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time. 
 
 From the SEC's Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations (October 26, 2009) 
 Although several types of projects such as constructing offshore platforms and development in urban areas, remote locations or environmentally sensitive locations by their nature customarily take a longer time to develop and therefore often do justify longer time periods, this determination must always take into consideration all of the facts and circumstances. No particular type of project per se justifies a longer time period, and any extension beyond five years should be the exception, and not the rule. 
 Factors that a company should consider in determining whether or not circumstances justify recognizing reserves even though development may extend past five years include, but are not limited to, the following 
 The company's level of ongoing significant development activities in the area to be developed (for example, drilling only the minimum number of wells necessary to maintain the lease generally would not constitute significant development activities) 
 The company's historical record at completing development of comparable long-term projects 
 The amount of time in which the company has maintained the leases, or booked the reserves, without significant development activities 
 The extent to which the company has followed a previously adopted development plan (for example, if a company has changed its development plan several times without taking significant steps to implement any of those plans, recognizing proved undeveloped reserves typically would not be appropriate) and 
 The extent to which delays in development are caused by external factors related to the physical operating environment (for example, restrictions on development on Federal lands, but not obtaining government permits), rather than by internal factors (for example, shifting resources to develop properties with higher priority). 
 
 (iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty. 
 
 (32) Unproved properties. Properties with no proved reserves.
