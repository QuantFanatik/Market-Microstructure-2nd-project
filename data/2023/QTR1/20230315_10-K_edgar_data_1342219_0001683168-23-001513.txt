Background 

Namliong SkyCosmos, Inc. we or
the Company was incorporated on February 7, 2005, under the name Gemwood Productions, for the purpose of marketing
and selling day spa services to tourists at resort destinations throughout Mexico. On November 2, 2006, we changed our name to Kreido
Biofuels, Inc. in connection with the acquisition of Kreido Laboratories, Inc., a California corporation Kreido Labs ),
and the disposition of the Gemwood Leasco, Inc. subsidiary, through which entity the tourist business had been carried out. Kreido Labs
was founded to develop proprietary technology for building micro-composite materials for electronic applications, and developed technology
to improve the speed, completeness and efficiency of certain chemical reactions, including esterifications and transesterifications, in
the pharmaceutical and special chemical industries. In the first quarter of 2006, Kreido Labs elected to focus exclusively on the
biodiesel industry. This business was not successful, and we sold the technology and related assets to an unrelated party on March 5,
2009. After that disposition, we sought unsuccessfully for another acquisition until the present time. In November of 2019, the Company
discontinued operations of its subsidiary, Kreido Labs. On April 19, 2022, the Company changed its name to Namliong SkyCosmos, Inc. 

Our registration statement
on Form SB-2, file number 333-140718, became effective on June 28, 2007. Subsequent to the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2008, we continued to file annual and quarterly reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
a voluntary basis through the quarter ended September 30, 2009. On February 16, 2009, we elected to terminate our registration and
our election to file periodic reports. On March 2, 2018, we filed a registration statement on Form 10, and the registration statement
became effective on May 8, 2018. 

On November 10, 2017, the
Company issued 142,924,167 shares of common stock to Reed Petersen, its then officer and director in consideration of cash of 21,434
paid by him to satisfy accounts payable of the Company, and in conversion of 150,075 in accounts payable which he had acquired from the
owners of that debt. This transaction was exempt under section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 as one not involving any public solicitation
or public offering, and was also exempt under Section 4(5) as an offering solely to accredited investors not involving any public solicitation
or public offering. 

On June 5, 2018, the Company
and its sole officer and director, G. Reed Petersen, entered into that certain Stock Purchase Agreement (the Stock Purchase

stock of the Company (the Control Shares ), representing approximately 73 of the issued and outstanding stock of
the Company, for aggregate cash consideration of 420,000 in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Stock Purchase Agreement.
The sale of the Control Shares consummated on June 29, 2018. In connection with the sale of the Control Shares, G. Reed Petersen resigned

In connection with the foregoing
resignations, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed Cheng Hsing HSU, our current Chief Financial Officer and Director, to serve
as the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Secretary, effective May 31, 2022. 

Except as set forth in the
foregoing, none of the directors or executive officers has a direct family relationship with any of the Company s directors or executive
officers, or any person nominated or chosen by the Company to become a director or executive officer. All officers and directors will
serve in his or her positions without compensation. The Company hopes to enter into a compensatory arrangement with each officer in the
future. 

Business Focus 

Our current business
is to seek to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination
with one or more businesses. Our acquisition strategy is to assess a broad range of potential business combination targets and complete
a business combination. In doing so, we will evaluate the historical financial statements of the target, its management, and projected
future results. In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass,
among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review
of financial and other information that will be made available to us. 

We are in active
discussions with affiliates of our directors, officers and or significant shareholders to effect a business combination but have not yet
executed any definitive agreements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully effect a business combination with
such affiliates. 

We intend to effectuate
our business combination using only our capital stock, debt or a combination of stock and debt. The issuance of additional shares of our
stock in a business combination: 

may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors; 

may subordinate the rights of holders of common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our common
stock; 

could cause a change of control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock are issued, which may affect, among other
things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present
officers and directors; 

may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of a person
seeking to obtain control of us; and 

may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. 

5 

Similarly, if we issue debt
securities, it could result in: 

default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after a business combination are insufficient to repay our debt
obligations; 

acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach
certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; 

our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; 

our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain
such financing while the debt security is outstanding; 

our inability to pay dividends on our common stock; 

using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for
dividends on our common stock if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; 

limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; 

increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government
regulation; and 

limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements,
execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt. 

As indicated in the accompanying
financial statements, as at December 31, 2022, we had 0 in cash. Further, we expect to
incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans, which could be funded by advances from management. We cannot assure you
that our plans to raise capital or to complete our business combination will be successful.

future results. In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass,
among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review
of financial and other information that will be made available to us. 

ITEM
7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS . 

This
discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of the Company
and its subsidiary for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020. The discussion and analysis that follows should be read together
with the section entitled Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements and our consolidated financial statements
and the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. 

Except
for historical information, the matters discussed in this section are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties
and are based upon judgments concerning various factors that are beyond the Company s control. Consequently, and because forward-looking
statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and
outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us
in this report. 

Results of Operations 

Following is management s
discussion of the relevant items affecting results of operations for the years ended 2022 and 2021. 

Revenues. The Company
generated no revenues during the years ended December 31,2022 and 2021. 

Operating Expenses. Operating
expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were 69,066, consisting primarily of professional fees, compared to 437,966 for the year
ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was mainly due to the no stock-based compensation was incurred for the current year. 

We expect operating expenses
to increase as we continue our process of identifying prospective acquisition targets and hopefully successfully consummate such an acquisition. 

11 

Other Income (Expense) .
The Company had net other income of 0 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 43,149 during the year ended December 31, 2021.
The decrease is mainly due to gain from forgiveness of related party debts incurred during the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Net Loss . For
the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had a net loss of 69,066, as compared to 394,817 for the year ended December 31, 2021.
The decrease in net loss was due to the decrease in stock-based compensation incurred by the Company. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of December 31, 2022, our
primary source of liquidity consisted of 0 in cash and cash equivalents. Since inception, we have financed our operations through a combination
of short and long-term loans, and through the private placement of our common stock. 

Going Concern Uncertainties. 

We have sustained significant
net losses which have resulted in a total stockholders deficit as at December 31, 2022 of 69,821 and are currently experiencing
a substantial shortfall in operating capital which raises doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Until we successfully
consummate an acquisition with an operating company, we expect to continue to incur net losses. Depending upon the financial profile of
our acquired company, we may continue in our net loss position even after the acquisition of an operating company. With the expected cash
requirements for the coming months, without additional cash inflows from an increase in revenues combined with continued cost-cutting
or a receipt of cash from capital investment, there is substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue operations. 

There is presently no agreement
in place with any source of financing for the Company, and we cannot be assured that the Company will be able to raise any additional
funds, or that such funds will be available on acceptable terms. Funds raised through future equity financing will likely be substantially
dilutive to current shareholders. Lack of additional funds will materially affect the Company and its business and may cause us to cease
operations. Consequently, shareholders could incur a loss of their entire investment in the Company. 

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities. 

For the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash
used in operating activities was 53,821, which consisted primarily of a net loss of 69,066, and increase in accrued liabilities of 15,245. 

For the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash
used in operating activities was 51,000, which consisted primarily of a net loss of 394,817, 42,174 gain from the forgiveness of debts
and a decrease in account payable of 26,509, offsetting by stock based compensation expense of 412,500. 

Net Cash Used In/Provided By Investing Activities. 

There was no net cash used
in or provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Net Cash Provided By Financing Activities. 

For the year ended December
31, 2022, net cash provided by financing activities was 53,821, from advance from a director of 53,821. 

For the year ended December
31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was 51,000, from the issuance of promissory note. 

12 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance
sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 

Contractual Obligations 

As a smaller reporting
company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this information. 

Critical accounting policies 

The
preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments which are
based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of
their evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances. Our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in Note 2
 to our financial statements contained herein. 

Recent accounting pronouncements 

The recent accounting standards
that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not
expected to have a material impact on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements upon adoption.

Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm 

 To the shareholders and the board
of directors of Namliong Skycosmos, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of Namliong Skycosmos, Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022, and 2021 the related statements
of operations, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related notes
collectively referred to as the financial statements . 

In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

Substantial Doubt about the Company s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3, the Company incurred a net loss of (69,066)
and suffered from an accumulated deficit of (49,520,154) as of December 31, 2022. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans with regards to these matters are also described in Note 3 to the financial
statements. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We
are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

Critical audit matters are matters arising from
the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and
that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021 

We have not selected
any specific business combination target. Our sole officer and director presently has, and in the future may have additional, fiduciary
or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination
opportunity. Accordingly, if our officer and director becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity
to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations
to present such opportunity to such entity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officer/director
will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. 

Our executive officer
is not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating
management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combination targets and monitoring the related
due diligence. 

On December 14, 2021,
certain shareholders owning 13,099,243 of our common stock, representing a majority of issued and outstanding shares, agreed to sell their
shares to 6 shareholders. This constitutes a change in control of the Company. 

common shares, par value per share, and preferred shares, also par
value. There were shares of common stock outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There were preferred shares
outstanding during any periods presented. 

During the year ended December 31, 2021, a related
party forgave an outstanding balance of 33,621 and the forgiveness of related party debt was recorded in additional paid-in capital. 

On October 15, 2021, the Company issued 750,000
shares of its common stock to a third party for services rendered, at the current market value of 0.55 per share, totaling 412,500 as
stock-based compensation recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

In September 2021, the Company received a promissory
note of 51,000 in a term of 3 months with interest charge at 12 per annum. In December 2021, upon the maturity, the Company converted
the promissory note of 12,000 into 12,000,000 shares of its common stock and the corresponding outstanding balance and interest charge
was waived by the note holder. 

At December 31, 2022, the Company had net operating
loss carry forwards of approximately that may be offset against future taxable income. The Tax Act also changed the rules
on net operating loss carry forwards. The 20-year limitation was eliminated, giving the taxpayer the ability to carry forward losses indefinitely.
However, NOL carry forward arising after January 1, 2020, will now be limited to 80 percent of taxable income. 

No tax benefit has been reported in the December
31, 2022, the Company s financial statements since the potential tax benefit is offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount. 
Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax reporting
purposes are subject to annual limitations. A change in ownership may limit net operating loss carry forwards in future years. The
benefits of our deferred tax assets, including our NOLs, built-in losses and tax credits would be reduced or potentially eliminated if
we experienced an ownership change under Section 382.

ITEM 9 CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING
AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 

None. 

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Management s Evaluation on Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls
and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 , as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, to allow for timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

As of December 31, 2022, we
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, we concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Our board of directors has only one
member. We do not have a formal audit committee. 

Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

Management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our company. Our control system is designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that: 

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and disposition of our assets; 

provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures are being made only
with proper authorizations of management and directors; and 

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use
or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management, including our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the 2013 Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Guidance for Smaller Public Companies. 
Based on our assessment and those criteria, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective
as of December 31, 2022. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There have been no significant
changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal ended December 31, 2022, that have materially
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Board Committees and Audit Committee Financial
Expert 

As of the date of this Report,
our board of directors is comprised of 1 director: Mr. Cheng Hsing Hsu, none of whom are independent. We do not currently have a standing
audit, nominating or compensation committee of the board of directors, or any committee performing similar functions. Our board of directors
performs the functions of audit, nominating and compensation committees. As of the date of this report, no member of our board of directors
qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities
Act. We hope to attract a director who qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as our business operations mature. 

Our board of directors does
not have a policy with regards to the consideration of any director candidates recommended by our shareholders. Our board of directors
has determined that it is in the best position to evaluate our company s requirements as well as the qualifications of each candidate
when the board considers a nominee for a position on our board of directors. 

Code of Ethics 

We have not yet adopted a
code of ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer principal accounting officer or controller
in light of our Company s current stage of development. We expect to adopt a code of ethics in the near future.

ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 

Compensation Philosophy and Objectives 

Our executive compensation
philosophy is to create a long-term direct relationship between pay and our performance. Our executive compensation program is designed
to provide a balanced total compensation package over the executive s career with us. The compensation program objectives are to
attract, motivate and retain the qualified executives that help ensure our future success, to provide incentives for increasing our profits
by awarding executives when corporate goals are achieved and to align the interests of executives and long-term stockholders. The compensation
package of our named executive officers consists of two main elements: 

1. 
 base salary for our executives that is competitive relative to the market, and that reflects individual performance, retention and other relevant considerations; and 

2. 
 discretionary bonus awards payable in cash and tied to the satisfaction of corporate objectives. 

Process for Setting Executive Compensation 

Until such time as we establish
a Compensation Committee, our Board is responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of our philosophy with respect to
the compensation of executives and for monitoring the implementation and results of the compensation philosophy to ensure compensation
remains competitive, creates proper incentives to enhance stockholder value and rewards superior performance. We expect to annually review
and approve for each named executive officer, and particularly with regard to the Chief Executive Officer, all components of the executive s
compensation. We process and factors (including individual and corporate performance measures and actual performance versus such measures)
used by the Chief Executive Officer to recommend such awards. Additionally, we expect to review and approve the base salary, equity-incentive
awards (if any) and any other special or supplemental benefits of the named executive officers. 

The Chief Executive Officer
periodically provides the Board with an evaluation of each named executive officer s performance, based on the individual performance
goals and objectives developed by the Chief Executive Officer at the beginning of the year, as well as other factors. The Board provides
an evaluation for the Chief Executive Officer. These evaluations serve as the bases for bonus recommendations and changes in the compensation
arrangements of our named executives. 

Our Compensation Peer Group 

We currently engage in informal
market analysis in evaluating our executive compensation arrangements. As the Company and its businesses mature, we may retain compensation
consultants that will assist us in developing a formal benchmark and selecting a compensation peer group of companies similar to us in
size or business for the purpose of comparing executive compensation levels. 

Program Components 

Our executive compensation
program consists of the following elements: 

17 

Base Salary 

Our base salary structure
is designed to encourage internal growth, attract and retain new talent, and reward strong leadership that will sustain our growth and
profitability. The base salary for each named executive officer reflects our past and current operating profits, the named executive officer s
individual contribution to our success throughout his career, internal pay equity and informal market data regarding comparable positions
within similarly situated companies. In determining and setting base salary, the Board considers all of these factors, though it does
not assign specific weights to any factor. The Board generally reviews the base salary for each named executive officer on an annual basis.
For each of our named executive officers, we review base salary data internally obtained by the Company for comparable executive positions
in similarly situated companies to ensure that the base salary rate for each executive is competitive relative to the market. 

Discretionary Bonus 

The objectives of our bonus
awards are to encourage and reward our employees, including the named executive officers, who contribute to and participate in our success
by their ability, industry, leadership, loyalty or exceptional service and to recruit additional executives who will contribute to that
success.

Narrative disclosure to Summary Compensation

None of our officers or directors
received compensation for services in his capacity as an officer or director of the Company. 

Other than set out above and
below, there are no arrangements or plans in which we provide pension, retirement or similar benefits for directors or executive officers.
We expect to establish one or more incentive compensation plans in the future. Our directors and executive officers may receive securities
of the Company as incentive compensation at the discretion of our board of directors in the future. We do not have any material bonus
or profit sharing plans pursuant to which cash or non-cash compensation is or may be paid to our directors or executive officers. 

Equity Awards 

There are no unvested options,
warrants or convertible securities outstanding. 

At no time during the last
fiscal year with respect to any of any of our executive officers was there: 

any outstanding option or other equity-based award repriced or otherwise materially modified (such as by extension of exercise periods, the change of vesting or forfeiture conditions, the change or elimination of applicable performance criteria, or the change of the bases upon which returns are determined; 

any waiver or modification of any specified performance target, goal or condition to payout with respect to any amount included in non-stock incentive plan compensation or payouts; 

any option or equity grant; 

any non-equity incentive plan award made to a named executive officer; 

any nonqualified deferred compensation plans including nonqualified defined contribution plans; or 

any payment for any item to be included under All Other Compensation in the Summary Compensation Table. 

Compensation of Directors 

During our fiscal year ended
December 31, 2022, we did not provide compensation to any of our employee directors for serving as our director. We currently have no
formal plan for compensating our directors for their services in their capacity as directors, although we may elect to issue stock options
to such persons from time to time. Directors are entitled to reimbursement for reasonable travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred
in connection with attendance at meetings of our board of directors. Our board of directors may award special remuneration to any director
undertaking any special services on our behalf other than services ordinarily required of a director. 

Compensation Risk Management 

Our Board of directors and
human resources staff conducted an assessment of potential risks that may arise from our compensation programs. Based on this assessment,
we concluded that our policies and practices do not encourage excessive and unnecessary risk taking that would be reasonably likely to
have material adverse effect on the Company. The assessment included our cash incentive programs, which awards non-executives with cash
bonuses for punctuality. Our compensation programs are substantially identical among business units, corporate functions and global locations
(with modifications to comply with local regulations as appropriate). The risk-mitigating factors considered in this assessment included: 

the alignment of pay philosophy, peer group companies and compensation amounts relative to local competitive practices to support our business objectives; and 

effective balance of cash, short- and long-term performance periods, caps on performance-based award schedules and financial metrics with individual factors and Board and management discretion.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider
Participation 

We have not yet established
a Compensation Committee. Our Board of Directors performs the functions that would be performed by a compensation committee. During the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, none of our executive officers has served: (i) on the compensation committee (or other board committee
performing equivalent functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the entire board of directors) of another entity, one of whose
executive officers served on our board of directors; (ii) as a director of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on the
compensation committee (or other board committee performing equivalent functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the entire

functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the entire board of directors) of another entity, one of whose executive officers

ITEM 13 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR
INDEPENDENCE 

Other than as disclosed below,
there are no transactions during our two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2022, or any currently proposed
transaction, in which our Company was or to be a participant and the amount exceeds the lesser of 120,000 or one percent of the average
of our Company s total assets at year end for our last two completed years, and in which any of our directors, officers or principal
stockholders, or any other related person as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K, had or have any direct or indirect material interest. 

During the year ended December 31, 2021, a related
party forgave an outstanding balance of 33,621 and the forgiveness of related party debt was recorded in additional paid-in capital.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had a zero balance of related party payable. 

During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021,
the Company has been provided with free office space by its shareholders. The management determined that such cost is nominal and did
not recognize the rent expense in its financial statements. 

Director Independence 

Though not a listed company,
we intend to adhere to the corporate governance standards adopted by NASDAQ. NASDAQ rules require our Board to make an affirmative determination
as to the independence of each director. Consistent with these rules, our Board conducted its annual review of director independence.
During the review, our Board considered relationships and transactions since incorporation between each director or any member of her
immediate family, on the one hand, and us and our subsidiaries and affiliates, on the other hand. The purpose of this review was to determine
whether any such relationships or transactions were inconsistent with a determination that the director is independent. Based on this
review, our Board determined that none of the current members of our Board are independent directors under the criteria established by
NASDAQ and by our Board. 

ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES 

Olayinka Oyebola Co. Olayinka audited our financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

All audit work was performed
by the employees of Olayinka for the above mentioned fiscal years. Our board of directors does not have an audit committee. The functions
customarily delegated to an audit committee are performed by our full board of directors. Our board of directors approves in advance,
all services performed by Olayinka, but have not adopted pre-approval policies or procedures. Our board of directors has considered whether
the provision of non-audit services is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant s independence, and has approved such
services. 

The following table sets forth
fees billed by our auditors during the last two fiscal years for services rendered for the audit of our annual financial statements and
the review of our quarterly financial statements, services by our auditors that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit

 DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES

Exhibit 4.2 

DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES 

The following is a description
of the material provisions of our capital stock, as well as other material terms of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation
and Amended and Restated Bylaws. We refer you to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, and Amended and Restated
Bylaws, copies of which have been filed as exhibits to this report. 

Common Stock 

We are authorized, subject
to limitations prescribed by Nevada law, to issue up to 300,000,000 shares of common stock with a nominal par value of 0.001. 

Dividend Rights 

Subject to preferences that
may apply to shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of outstanding shares of our common stock are entitled to
receive dividends out of funds legally available if our board of directors, in its discretion, determines to issue dividends and only
then at the times and in the amounts that our board of directors may determine. 

Voting Rights 

Each holder of common stock
is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Under our articles
of incorporation, stockholders do not have the right to cumulate votes for the election of directors. 

No Preemptive or Similar Rights 

Our common stock is not entitled
to preemptive rights and is not subject to conversion, redemption or sinking fund provisions. 

Right to Receive Liquidation Distributions 

Upon our dissolution, liquidation
or winding-up, the assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders are distributable ratably among the holders of our common
stock, subject to prior satisfaction of all outstanding debt and liabilities and the preferential rights and payment of liquidation preferences,
if any, on any outstanding shares of preferred stock. 

Preferred Stock 

We are authorized to issue
up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a nominal par value of 0.001. We may amend our Amended Articles of Incorporation
in the future to allow our board of directors to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could
adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing
flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of delaying,
deferring or preventing a change in control of our company and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting
and other rights of the holders of common stock. We have no current plan to issue any shares of preferred stock. 

1 

Anti-takeover Provisions 

Some of the provisions of
Nevada law, our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring
or discouraging another person from acquiring control of our company or removing our incumbent officers and directors. These provisions,
summarized below, are expected to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These
provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our board of directors. 
We believe that the benefits of increased protection against an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us outweigh
the disadvantages of discouraging such proposals. Among other things, negotiation of such proposals could result in an improvement of
their terms. 

Our Amended Articles of Incorporation or Amended
and Restated Bylaws provide that: 

Board of Directors Vacancies . Our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws authorize only our board of directors to fill vacant directorships, including newly created seats (unless a vacancy created by the removal of a director by the shareholders shall be filled by the shareholders at the meeting at which the removal was effected). In addition, the number of directors constituting our board of directors is permitted to be set only by a resolution adopted by a majority vote of our entire board of directors. These provisions would prevent a stockholder from increasing the size of our board of directors and then gaining control of our board of directors by filling the resulting vacancies with its own nominees. This makes it more difficult to change the composition of our board of directors but promotes continuity of management. 

Director Removals . Our Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that directors can be removed with or without cause by holders holding in the aggregate at least two-thirds (2/3) of the outstanding shares of the Corporation and may be removed for cause by the Board. This makes it more difficult to change the composition of the Board. 

Stockholder Action; Special Meeting of Stockholders . Our bylaws provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called by the President or the Secretary at the written request holders or more than fifty percent (50 of the shares entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders, a majority of our board of directors, or the President. 

No Cumulative Voting . Our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws do not provide for cumulative voting. 

Issuance of Blank Check Preferred Stock . Our board of directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by our board of directors. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock enables our board of directors to render more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest, or otherwise; 

Bylaws Amendments Without Stockholder Approval . Our Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that a majority of the authorized number of directors will generally have the power to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws without stockholder approval; 

Broad Indemnity . We are permitted to indemnify directors and officers against losses that they may incur in investigations and legal proceedings resulting from their services to us, which may include services in connection with takeover defense measures. This provision may make it more difficult to remove directors and officers and delay a change in control of our management.

These provisions of our Amended Articles of Incorporation
and Bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging another person or entity from acquiring control of us. 

The amendment to our Articles
of Incorporation to elect not to be governed by the Interested Shareholder Combination Statutes will not have any immediate effect on
the rights of existing stockholders. To the extent that we qualify as a resident domestic corporation in the future, the Board will be
able to enter into acquisitions and combinations with entities affiliated with its executive officer, directors and control shareholders
with greater ease, including without limitation, without the requirement of obtaining the approval of the stockholders in certain instances. 

Anti-Takeover Provisions
of the NRS 

NRS Sections 78.411 to 78.444
inclusive apply to combinations between resident domestic corporations (defined as a Nevada domestic corporation that has 200 or more
stockholders of record) and certain affiliated stockholders (collectively, the Interested Shareholder Combination Statutes ).
The Nevada Interested Shareholder Combination Statutes generally prohibit a Nevada corporation, with shares registered under section 12
of the Exchange Act and with 200 or more stockholders of record, from engaging in a combination (defined in the statute to include a variety
of transactions, including mergers, asset sales, issuance of stock and other actions resulting in a financial benefit to the Interested
Stockholder) with an Interested Stockholder (defined in the statute generally as a person that is the beneficial owner of 10 or more
of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares), for a period of three years following the date that such person became an Interested
Stockholder unless the board of directors of the corporation first approved either the combination or the transaction that resulted in
the stockholder's becoming an Interested Stockholder. If this approval is not obtained, the combination may be consummated after the three
year period expires if either (a) (1) the board of directors of the corporation approved the combination or the purchase of the shares
by the Interested Stockholder before the date that the person became an Interested Stockholder, (2) the transaction by which the person
became an Interested Stockholder was approved by the board of directors of the corporation before the person became an interested stockholder,
or (3) the combination is approved by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of voting power not beneficially owned by the Interested
Stockholder at a meeting called no earlier than three years after the date the Interested Stockholder became such; or (b) the aggregate
amount of cash and the market value of consideration other than cash to be received by all holders of common stock and holders of any
other class or series of shares not beneficially owned by an Interested Stockholder meets the minimum requirements set forth in NRS Sections
78.441 through 78.444. 

A Nevada corporation may adopt
an amendment to its articles of incorporation expressly electing not to be governed by these provisions of the NRS, if such amendment
is approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested shares entitled to vote; provided, however, such vote by disinterested
stockholders is not required to the extent the Nevada corporation is not subject to such provisions. Such an amendment to the articles
of incorporation does not become effective until 18 months after the vote of the disinterested stockholders and does not apply to any
combination with an Interested Stockholder whose date of acquiring shares is on or before the effective date of the amendment. Our Articles
of Incorporation provide that we have elected NOT to be governed by NRS Sections 78.411 to 78.444 inclusive. 

Sections 78.378-78.3793 of
the NRS also limits the acquisition of a controlling interest in a Nevada corporation with 200 or more stockholders of record, at least
100 of who have Nevada addresses appearing on the stock ledger of the corporation, and that does business in Nevada directly or through
an affiliated corporation. According to the NRS, an acquiring person who acquires a controlling interest in an issuing corporation may
not exercise voting rights on any control shares unless such voting rights are conferred by a majority vote of the disinterested stockholders
of the issuing corporation at a special or annual meeting of the stockholders. In the event that the control shares are accorded full
voting rights and the acquiring person acquires control shares with a majority or more of all the voting power, any stockholder, other
than the acquiring person, who does not vote in favor of authorizing voting rights for the control shares is entitled to demand payment
for the fair value of such person's shares. 

Under the NRS, a controlling
interest means the ownership of outstanding voting shares of an issuing corporation sufficient to enable the acquiring person, individually
or in association with others, directly or indirectly, to exercise (1) one-fifth or more but less than one-third, (2) one-third or more
but less than a majority, or (3) a majority or more of the voting power of the issuing corporation in the election of directors. Outstanding
voting shares of an issuing corporation that an acquiring person acquires or offers to acquire in an acquisition and acquires within 90
days immediately preceding the date when the acquiring person became an acquiring person are referred to as control shares. 

The control share provisions
of the NRS do not apply if the corporation opts-out of such provisions in the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation in
effect on the tenth day following the acquisition of a controlling interest by an acquiring person. Our Articles of Incorporation provide
that we have elected NOT to be governed by NRS Sections 78.378-78.3792 inclusive.
