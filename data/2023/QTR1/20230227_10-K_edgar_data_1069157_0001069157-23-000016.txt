 East West has a commercial business operating license in China through its subsidiary, East West Bank (China) Limited, which makes it unique among U.S.-based regional banks. This license allows the Bank to open branches, make loans and collect deposits in the country. The Bank continues to develop its international banking presence with its network of overseas branches and representative offices. The latest expansion is the Singapore representative office, which opened in January 2023. In addition to facilitating traditional letters of credit and trade financing to businesses, these representative offices allow the Bank to assist existing clients and to develop new business relationships.

 Competition 
 
 The Bank operates in a highly competitive environment. The Company faces intense competition from domestic and foreign lending institutions, numerous other financial services providers and other entities, including as a result of emerging technologies. Competition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer service and convenience, quality and range of products and services offered, reputation, fees, interest rates on loans and deposits and lending limits. Competition also varies based on the types of customers and locations served. The Company is a leader of banking market share in the Asian American community; and maintains a differentiated presence within selected markets by providing cross-border commercial banking expertise to customers between the U.S. and Asia. 
 
 While the Company believes it is well positioned within a highly competitive industry, the industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory, economic, and technological changes, as well as continuing consolidation. 

Human Capital 
 
 As a company that delivers relationship-driven financial solutions to a diverse customer base, we believe the strength of our workforce is one of the most significant contributors to our success. Our key human capital objectives are to attract, develop and retain quality talent who reflect our values and enable us to serve our customers. To achieve these objectives, our human resource programs have been designed based on our core values and the attributes we seek to foster, which include absolute integrity, customer orientation, creativity, respect, teamwork and selflessness. We use these core values to better service our customers and prepare our employees for leadership positions and to advance their careers. We are committed to promoting diversity in employment and advancement.

 Diversity and Inclusion 
 
 East West Bank was founded in 1973 in Chinatown, Los Angeles, California as a savings loan association for immigrants who were underserved by mainstream banks. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank was the largest FDIC-insured, minority-operated depository institution headquartered in the U.S., serving communities with diverse ethnicities and socio-economic backgrounds in eight states across the nation. Our operations are concentrated in areas that include larger numbers of immigrants and minorities. We proudly offer home loans and other products and services that support low-to-moderate income, minority and immigrant communities. We also provide community development loans, and partner with a diverse list of nonprofit and community-based organizations to promote wealth generation and entrepreneurship in underserved communities. Our focus on basic, fair-priced products and alternative credit criteria supports the under-banked, which is part of our founding mission. In addition, given our diverse customer base and the diversity of the communities that we serve, our retail bankers are able to assist customers in English and in over 10 other languages. 
 
 Promoting diversity and inclusion in our workforce and executive leadership is critical to our continued growth and success, and is at the core of our history and guiding principles. Our commitment to this mission is reflected in the composition of our employees. In addition, we have adopted an Environmental and Social Policy Framework that governs our mission to support diversity, and formed two employee resource groups focused on cultural awareness and empowering women to pursue leadership development and opportunities. As of December 31, 2022, the composition of our workforce was as follows:

 To put our diversity in context, minorities made up 46 of the workforce and 18 of the managers of FDIC-regulated institutions, according to the most recently available 2020 Diversity Self-Assessment from the FDIC s Financial Institution Diversity Self-Assessment program. Our organizational commitment to diversity, under the leadership and oversight of our Board of Directors, is further reflected by the composition of our ten-member Board, which is presented in the following table as of December 31, 2022. This commitment to diversity was acknowledged in Bank Director s 2022 RankingBanking study, in which we received the Best Board ranking due to our strong corporate governance practices, and the diversity and expertise of our directors.

Talent Acquisition, Development and Promotion 
 
 An experienced and well qualified workforce is essential to delivering high quality and reliable banking services to our customers and to managing the Company in a safe and sound manner. We endeavor to attract, develop, and retain diverse, motivated talent as part of our ongoing commitment to building a stronger workforce to serve our customers and communities. 
 
 The focus on leadership development and promoting from within is a critical part of our succession planning for key roles throughout the organization and fostering organizational stability. We recognize the importance of employee development and career growth in fostering retention of our employees, which is one of the Company's strategic objectives. In 2022, 20 of our employees advanced their careers within the Bank through over 600 internal promotions or new opportunities. We provide a variety of resources to help all employees grow in their current roles and build new skills for future advancement, including the encouragement of continuing education and providing benefits such as tuition reimbursement. 
 
 Fair and Equitable Compensation 
 
 Our compensation and benefits program provides both short- and long-term awards, incentivizing performance, and aligning employee and stockholder interests. Employee compensation packages include a competitive base salary and, subject to Company and individual performance, may include an annual cash and stock incentive bonus. We are committed to fair and equitable compensation programs, and regularly assess the current business environment and labor markets to review our compensation and benefits programs for pay equity. We sponsor a 401(k) plan for U.S. employees, provide a Company matching contribution, and maintain other defined contribution retirement plans. As of December 31, 2022, 94 of employees participated in our 401(k) plan. 
 
 To foster a strong sense of ownership and to align the interests of our employees with our stockholders, restricted stock units are awarded to eligible employees under our stock incentive programs. W e also award stock grants under our Spirit of Ownership program to all of our employees, regardless of job title or part-time/full-time status. The program allows each employee to share directly in the success they help create. The fact that all our employees are also owners is a source of pride for us. In 2022, the Company granted over 500 thousand restricted stock units as part of its stock compensation programs. 
 
 Wellness and Safety 
 
 We are committed to supporting our employees well-being by offering flexible and competitive benefits. Comprehensive health insurance coverage (medical, dental and vision) is offered to employees working at least 30 hours each week. We offer paid time off, life insurance, disability insurance, parental leave, wellness and benefits programs designed to assist employees in maintaining a healthy work-life balance. We also offer an Employee Assistance Program which aids benefits-eligible employees and their household members with personal and professional issues. We apply a consistent approach towards employee policies, opportunities, benefits, and protections to all employees regardless of their locations, except if there are contradictions between individual state laws. We took a wide variety of measures to protect the health and well-being of our employees and customers during the COVID-19 pandemic and are now supporting employees in returning to the office and/or shifting to new working arrangements. 
 
 New Ways of Working 
 
 The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated our capabilities with respect to flexible work. We introduced a hybrid schedule and work-from-home arrangements to better support managers and employees as they adapt to new ways of working that embrace flexibility, promote inclusion and enhance productivity. 
 
 Commitment to Community 
 
 We are committed to making positive and lasting impacts in our communities through our business activities and our volunteer and charitable efforts. We aim to enhance the quality of life in our communities by engaging in meaningful and effective programs that help increase homeownership, preserve affordable housing, promote wealth building, enable more inclusive access to banking services and help alleviate homelessness. We are a vital part of the communities in which we live and work, and we encourage our employees to engage with our local communities by leading or participating in events to foster community development.

As a bank holding company, East West is subject to primary regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act. The Bank is regulated, supervised, and examined by the Federal Reserve, the DFPI, and, with respect to consumer laws, the CFPB. As the insurer of the Bank s deposits, the FDIC has back-up examination authority of the Bank as well. In addition, the Bank is regulated by foreign regulatory agencies in international jurisdictions where we have a presence, including China, Hong Kong and Singapore. East West also has a wholly-owned nonbank subsidiary, East West Markets, LLC ("East West Markets"), which is an SEC-registered broker-dealer and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA"). East West Markets is subject to regulatory requirements from several regulatory bodies, including the SEC, FINRA, and state securities regulators. 
 
 The Company is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, as amended, both as administered by the SEC. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol EWBC and subject to Nasdaq rules for listed companies. 
 
 Described below are certain provisions of selected laws and regulations applicable to East West and the Bank. The descriptions are not intended to be complete, nor are they meant to fully address the statutes and regulations effects and potential effects on East West and the Bank, and the descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations. A change in applicable statutes, regulations or regulatory policies may have a material effect on the Company s business. 
 
 East West 
 
 As a bank holding company and pursuant to its election of financial holding company status, East West is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act. The BHC Act provides a federal framework for the regulation and supervision of bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries. The BHC Act and other federal statutes grant the Federal Reserve authority to, among other things: 
 
 require periodic reports and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require in its discretion; 
 9 

require bank holding companies to maintain certain levels of capital and, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ), limit the ability of bank holding companies to pay dividends or bonuses unless their capital levels exceed the capital conservation buffer (see the section captioned Regulatory Capital Requirements included elsewhere under this item); 
 require bank holding companies to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to subsidiary banks and commit resources, as necessary, to support each subsidiary bank, including at times when bank holding companies may not be inclined to do so, and the failure to do so generally may be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and a violation of Federal Reserve regulations; 
 restrict dividends and other distributions from subsidiary banks to their parent bank holding companies; 
 require bank holding companies to terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest certain nonbank subsidiaries, affiliates or investments if the Federal Reserve believes that the activity, ownership, or control of the nonbank subsidiary or affiliate constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of the bank holding company, or if the activity, ownership, or control is inconsistent with the purposes of the BHC Act; 
 regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt, including by imposing interest ceilings and reserve requirements and requiring a bank holding company to obtain prior approval to purchase or redeem its securities in certain situations; 
 approve in advance senior executive officer or director changes and prohibit certain golden parachute payments to officers and employees, including change in control agreements and new employment agreements that are contingent upon termination; and 
 approve in advance the acquisitions of and mergers with bank holding companies, banks and other financial companies, and consider certain competitive, management, financial, financial stability and other factors in granting these approvals. DFPI approval may also be required for certain acquisitions and mergers involving a California state-chartered bank such as the Bank. 
 
 East West s election to be a financial holding company as permitted under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 GLBA generally allows East West to engage in any activity that the Federal Reserve has determined to be financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any such activity, without prior Federal Reserve approval. Activities that are considered financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance agency and underwriting, merchant banking activities and activities that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity. To maintain financial holding company status and continue to be able to engage in new activities or investments that are financial in nature, a financial holding company and all its depository institution subsidiaries must be well capitalized and well managed, and the financial holding company s depository institution subsidiaries must have Community Reinvestment Act CRA ratings of at least Satisfactory. A depository institution subsidiary is considered well capitalized if it satisfies the requirements for this status discussed in the sections captioned Regulatory Capital Requirements and Prompt Corrective Action , included elsewhere under this item. A depository institution subsidiary is considered well managed if it received a composite rating and a management rating of at least Satisfactory in its most recent examination. See the section captioned Community Reinvestment Act included elsewhere under this item. 
 
 The Bank and its Subsidiaries 
 
 East West Bank is a California state-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured by the FDIC. The Bank s operations in the U.S. are primarily regulated and supervised by the Federal Reserve and the DFPI, and its activities outside the U.S. are regulated and supervised by its U.S. regulators and the applicable regulatory authority in the host country in which each overseas office is located. Specific federal and state laws and regulations that are applicable to banks monitor, among other things, their regulatory capital levels, the scope of their business, their investments, their reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, and the nature and amount of collateral for certain loans. Bank regulatory agencies also have extensive discretion to impose various restrictions on management or operations and to issue policies and guidance in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies. California law permits state-chartered commercial banks to engage in any activity permissible for national banks, unless such activity is expressly prohibited by state law. The Bank may also form subsidiaries to engage in many activities commonly conducted by national banks in operating subsidiaries. Further, pursuant to the GLBA, the Bank may conduct certain financial activities in a subsidiary to the same extent permitted for a national bank, provided the Bank is well capitalized and well managed and has a CRA rating of at least Satisfactory. 
 
 10 

Regulation of Foreign Subsidiaries and Branches 
 
 The Bank s foreign subsidiary, East West Bank (China) Limited, is subject to applicable foreign laws and regulations, such as those implemented by the CBIRC. East West Bank s Hong Kong branch is subject to applicable foreign laws and regulations, such as those implemented by the HKMA and the HKSFC. The Singapore representative office, which opened in January 2023, is subject to applicable foreign laws and regulations, such as those implemented by the MAS. 
 
 Regulatory Capital Requirements 
 
 The federal banking agencies have imposed capital adequacy requirements, known as the Basel III Capital Rules, intended to ensure that banking organizations maintain capital that is commensurate with the degree of risk associated with their operations. The Basel III Capital Rules define the components of regulatory capital, including Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 ), Tier 1 and 2 capital, and set forth minimum capital adequacy ratios of capital to risk-weighted assets and total assets. The Basel III Capital Rules also prescribe a standardized approach for risk-weighting assets and include a number of risk- weighting categories that affect the denominator in banking institutions regulatory capital ratios. 
 
 Under the Basel III Capital Rules, to be considered adequately capitalized, standardized approach banking organizations, such as the Company and the Bank are required to maintain minimum capital ratios of at least 4.5 CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets, 6.0 Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, 8.0 total risk-based capital (i.e., Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets and a 4.0 Tier 1 leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets. The Basel III Capital Rules also include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 on top of each of the minimum risk-based capital ratios. Banking institutions with a risk-based capital ratio that meets or exceeds the minimum requirement but does not exceed the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary bonus payments based on the amount of the shortfall. As of December 31, 2022, the Company s and the Bank s capital ratios exceeded the minimum capital adequacy requirements of the federal banking agencies, including the capital conservation buffer, and the Company and the Bank were classified as well capitalized. For additional discussion and disclosure see Item 7. MD A Regulatory Capital and Ratios and Note 16 Regulatory Requirements and Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 
 
 The Bank is also subject to additional capital requirements under the Prompt Corrective Action PCA regulations that implement Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act FDIA ), as discussed below under the Prompt Corrective Action section. 
 
 Regulatory Capital-Related Developments 
 
 From time to time, the regulatory agencies propose changes and amendments to, and issue interpretations of, risk-based capital requirements and related reporting instructions. Such proposals and interpretations could, if implemented in the future, affect our regulatory capital requirements and reported capital ratios. 
 
 In March 2020, the United States federal banking agencies adopted a rule that allowed banking organizations to elect to delay the estimated effects of adopting the current expected credit loss accounting standard CECL on regulatory capital until January 2022, and subsequently to phase in the effects through January 2025 (i.e., a five-year transition, in total). The Company adopted the five-year transition in 2020. As a result, the effects of CECL on the Company s and the Bank s regulatory capital were delayed through the year 2021, after which the effects are being phased-in over a three-year period from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. For additional discussion and disclosure on CECL, see Item 7. MD A Regulatory Capital and Ratios and Note 16 Regulatory Requirements and Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 
 
 11 

Prompt Corrective Action 
 
 The FDIA, as amended, requires federal banking agencies to take PCA with respect to insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA includes the following five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. A depository institution s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulations. The capital tiers in the PCA framework do not apply directly to bank holding companies (such as the Company). Under the federal banking agencies regulations implementing the PCA provisions of the FDIA, an insured depository institution (such as the Bank) generally is classified in the following categories based on the capital measures indicated: 
 PCA Category Risk-Based Capital Ratios Total Capital Tier 1 Capital CET1 Capital Tier 1 Leverage Well capitalized (1) 
 10 8 6.5 5 Adequately capitalized 8 6 4.5 4 Undercapitalized 
 An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios, if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. A bank s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying PCA regulations and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes. 
 
 The FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of any dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company, if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to several requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks and/or restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits. Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. The FDIA also generally permits only well capitalized insured depository institutions to accept brokered deposits, although an adequately capitalized institution may apply to the FDIC for a waiver of this restriction. 
 
 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act and Stress Testing 
 
 In May 2018, the enactment of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act EGRRCPA amended certain provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act and other statutes administered by the Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies. The EGRRCPA lifted the asset size threshold for many of the Dodd-Frank Act enhanced prudential standards that had previously applied to banks and bank holding companies with total consolidated assets between 50 billion and 100 billion, except for the requirement to maintain a risk committee. The EGRRCPA also raised the asset size threshold for required company-run stress testing at banks and bank holding companies from 10 billion to 250 billion. Additionally, based on authority provided in the EGRRCPA, the Federal Reserve raised the asset size threshold for required supervisory stress testing at bank holding companies from 50 billion to 100 billion. Although the Company and the Bank are not required to conduct company-run or supervisory stress tests, we continue to conduct annual capital and quarterly liquidity stress tests. 
 
 12 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Supervision 
 
 The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which has the authority to implement, examine and enforce compliance with federal consumer financial laws that apply to banking institutions with total consolidated assets exceeding 10 billion (such as the Bank) and their affiliates. The CFPB focuses its supervisory, examination, and enforcement efforts on, among other things: 
 risks to consumers and compliance with federal consumer financial laws when evaluating the policies and practices of a financial institution; 
 unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices; 
 rulemaking to implement various federal consumer statutes such as the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Electronic Fund Transfer Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Fair Credit Billing Act, and the Consumer Financial Protection Act; and 
 the markets in which firms operate and risks to consumers posed by activities in those markets. 
 
 The statutes and regulations that the CFPB enforces mandate certain disclosure and other requirements, and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with consumers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting payments on loans, and providing other services. The CFPB s rulemaking, examination and enforcement authority has affected and will continue to impact financial institutions that provide consumer financial products and services, including the Company and the Bank. These regulatory activities may limit the types of financial services and products the Company may offer. Failure to comply with federal and state laws prohibiting unfair, abusive, or fraudulent business practices, untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition, can subject the Bank to various penalties, including, but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines or criminal penalties, punitive damages, restitution to consumers, and the loss of certain contractual rights or business opportunities and may also result in significant reputational harm. 
 
 Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve s Reserve Requirements 
 
 The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB of San Francisco. As an FHLB member, the Bank is required to own a certain amount of capital stock in the FHLB. The Bank may also access the FHLB for both short-term and long-term secured credit. 
 
 The Federal Reserve requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts either in the form of vault cash or an interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve Bank, or a pass-through account as defined by the Federal Reserve. Effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent, eliminating the reserve requirement for all depository institutions, an action that provides liquidity in the banking system to support lending to households and businesses. The Bank is a member bank and stockholder of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco FRBSF ). 
 
 Dividends and Other Transfers of Funds 
 
 The principal source of liquidity of East West is dividends received from the Bank. The Bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends. In addition, the banking agencies may prohibit or limit the Bank from paying dividends, depending upon the Bank s financial condition, if such payment is deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Furthermore, under the federal PCA regime, the Federal Reserve or FDIC may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company s bank subsidiary is classified as significantly undercapitalized or, in some circumstances, undercapitalized. It is the Federal Reserve s policy that a bank holding company should generally pay dividends on common stock only if the company s net income available to common stockholders over the past four quarters, net of distributions, would be sufficient to fully fund the dividends, and if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the company s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. It is also the Federal Reserve s policy that a bank holding company should not maintain dividend levels that undermine the company s ability to be a financial source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve requires bank holding companies to continuously review their dividend policy in light of their organizations financial condition and compliance with regulatory capital requirements, and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels, unless both asset quality and capital are strong. 
 
 13 

Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders 
 
 Pursuant to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, as implemented by the Federal Reserve s Regulation W, banks are subject to restrictions that limit their ability to engage in transactions with their affiliates, including their parent bank holding companies. Regulation W limits the types, terms and amounts of these transactions and generally requires the transactions to be on an arm s-length basis. In general, Regulation W requires that covered transactions, which include a bank s extension of credit to or purchase of assets from an affiliate, be limited to 10 of the bank s capital and surplus with respect to any one affiliate, and 20 of the bank s capital and surplus with respect to the aggregate of all covered transactions with all affiliates. In addition, a bank generally may not extend credit to an affiliate unless the extension of credit is secured by specified amounts of collateral. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions, including by treating derivative transactions resulting in a bank s credit exposure to an affiliate as covered transactions. In addition, the Volcker Rule under the Dodd-Frank Act establishes certain prohibitions, restrictions and requirements (known as Super 23A and Super 23B on transactions between a covered fund and a banking entity that serves as an investment manager, investment adviser, organizer and offeror, or sponsor with respect to that covered fund, regardless of whether the banking entity has an ownership interest in the fund. 
 
 Federal law also limits a bank s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and principal stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons (collectively, insiders ). Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. The terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the bank s capital. 
 
 Community Reinvestment Act 
 
 Under the CRA, an insured depository institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation to help serve the credit needs of its communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers and neighborhoods. The Federal Reserve periodically evaluates a state member bank s performance under applicable performance criteria and assign a rating of outstanding, satisfactory, needs to improve or substantial noncompliance. The Federal Reserve takes this performance into account when reviewing applications by banks and their parent companies to expand branches, relocate, add subsidiaries and affiliates, expand into new financial activities and merge with or acquire other financial institutions. Unsatisfactory CRA performance may result in the denial of such applications. Based on the most recent CRA examination as of March 8, 2021, the Bank was rated outstanding . On May 5, 2022, the federal banking agencies issued a joint Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that requested comment on substantial revisions to the methods used to evaluate an insured institution s record of satisfying the credit needs of its entire communities, including low- and moderate-income individuals and neighborhoods, under the CRA. The changes that the agencies have proposed could make it more challenging and costly for the Bank and other insured depository institutions to receive an outstanding or satisfactory rating, but the impact on the Company will ultimately depend on whether and how such changes are implemented and applied. 
 
 FDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments 
 
 The FDIC insures the Bank s customer deposits through the DIF up to 250,000 for each depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, for each account ownership category. The DIF is funded mainly through quarterly insurance assessments on insured banks based on their assessment base. The Dodd-Frank Act revised the FDIC s fund management authority by establishing a minimum Designated Reserve Ratio of 1.35 percent of total estimated insured deposits and redefining the assessment base to be calculated as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. The Bank s DIF quarterly assessment is calculated by multiplying its assessment base by the applicable assessment rate. The assessment rate is calculated based on an institution s risk profile, including capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk ratings, certain financial measures to assess an institution s ability to withstand asset related stress and funding related stress, and a measure of loss severity that estimates the relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of the Bank s failure. 
 
 Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, extraordinary growth in insured deposits caused the DIF reserve ratio to fall below the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent. This growth was primarily due to U.S. monetary policy action, direct government assistance to consumers and businesses, and an overall reduction in spending. The FDIC adopted a restoration plan in September 2020, which it amended in June 2022, to restore the DIF reserve ratio to at least 1.35 percent by September 30, 2028. 
 
 14 

In October 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule to increase the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly for insured depository institutions by two basis points bps ), beginning in the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The new assessment rate schedules will remain in effect unless and until the reserve ratio meets or exceeds two percent. As a result of the adoption of the assessment rate schedules, the FDIC insurance costs of the Bank will likely increase but not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
 
 The FDIC may terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound, that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, or that the institution has violated any applicable rule, regulation, condition, or order imposed by the FDIC. 
 
 Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering 
 
 The Bank Secrecy Act BSA ), USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 PATRIOT Act ), and other federal laws and regulations impose obligations on U.S. financial institutions to implement and maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls, which are reasonably designed to prevent, detect and report instances of money laundering, the financing of terrorism and to comply with recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Regulatory agencies require that the Bank have an effective governance structure for the program that includes effective oversight by our Board of Directors and management. We regularly evaluate and continue to enhance our systems and procedures to comply with the BSA, the PATRIOT Act and other anti-money laundering AML initiatives. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate BSA/AML programs, or to comply with all applicable laws or regulations, could have serious legal, compliance, financial and reputational consequences for the institution. 
 
 The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 AML Act was enacted in January 2021 and includes the most substantial changes to U.S. AML law since the PATRIOT Act. Among other changes, the AML Act imposes new beneficial ownership reporting requirements for certain entities doing business in the U.S.; requires the U.S. Treasury s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network FinCEN to establish government-wide priorities for AML and countering the financing of terrorism; increases AML whistleblower awards and expands whistleblower protections; modernizes the statutory definition of financial institution to include value that substitutes for currency enhances penalties for BSA and AML violations; streamlines and modernizes BSA and AML requirements; and improves coordination and cooperation among international, federal, state, and tribal AML law enforcement agencies. The Bank regularly evaluates and seeks to continue to enhance its systems and procedures as needed to ensure compliance with BSA/AML laws and regulations. 
 
 Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation 
 
 The U.S. Department of the Treasury s Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. financial institutions do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various executive orders and Acts of Congress. Federal banking regulators also examine banks for compliance with regulations administered by the OFAC for economic sanctions against designated foreign countries, designated nationals, and others. OFAC publishes lists of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. Generally, if a bank identifies a transaction or account relating to a person or entity on an OFAC list, it must freeze the account or block the transaction, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal, strategic, and reputational consequences, and result in civil monetary penalties on the Company and the Bank. 
 
 Privacy and Cybersecurity 
 
 Federal statutes and regulations require banking organizations to take certain actions to protect nonpublic consumer financial information. The Bank has a privacy policy that it must disclose to consumers annually. In some cases, the Bank must obtain a consumer s consent before sharing information with an unaffiliated third party, and the Bank must allow a consumer to opt out of the Bank s sharing of information with its affiliates for marketing and certain other purposes. These additional conditions affect the Bank s information exchanges with credit reporting agencies. The Bank s privacy practices and the effectiveness of its systems to protect consumer privacy are subjects covered in the Federal Reserve s periodic compliance examinations. 
 
 15 

The Federal Reserve pays close attention to the cybersecurity practices of state member banks and their holding companies and affiliates. The interagency council of the federal banking agencies, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council FFIEC ), has issued several policy statements and other guidance for banks in light of the growing risk posed by cybersecurity threats. The FFIEC has recently focused on such matters as compromised customer credentials, cyber resilience and business continuity planning. Examinations by the banking agencies now include review of an institution s information technology and its ability to thwart or mitigate cyber-attacks. The federal banking agencies require banking organizations to notify their primary federal regulator of significant computer security incidents within 36 hours of determining that such an incident has occurred. 
 
 Consumer data privacy and data protection are also the subject of state laws. For example, the Bank is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA ). This statute grants consumers several rights, including the right to request disclosure of information collected about them and whether that information has been sold or shared with others, the right to request correction of information, the right to request deletion of personal information (subject to certain exceptions), and the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information. However, a consumer does not have these rights with respect to information that is collected, processed, sold, or disclosed pursuant to the GLBA or the California Financial Information Privacy Act. The CCPA was amended in November 2020, when California voters passed Proposition 24, the California Privacy Rights Act CPRA ). The CPRA, which amends existing CCPA requirements effective January 1, 2023, with a one-year look back period, includes limitations on the sharing of personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising and the use of sensitive personal information, creates a new correction right, and establishes a new agency to enforce California privacy law. The California Attorney General has adopted regulations to implement the CCPA and has drafted regulations to implement the CPRA. 
 
 There has also been significant development of new privacy laws and regulations in China. For example, the Standing Committee of China s National People s Congress passed the Personal Information Protection Law PIPL ), effective November 1, 2021. The PIPL establishes guiding principles on protection of a Chinese citizen s personal information and applies to entities operating in China, foreign organizations, and individuals processing personal information outside China. Failure to comply with the PIPL requirements and other applicable international protection laws and regulations can result in monetary penalties, entities or individuals being placed on government s banned list, or potential termination of future business activities in China, and potentially impact our Hong Kong and China operations. 
 
 Climate-Related Risk Management 
 
 In recent years, the federal banking agencies have increased their focus on climate-related risks affecting the operations of banks, the communities they serve and the broader financial system. The agencies have begun to enhance their supervisory expectations regarding banks climate risk management practices, including by proposing guidance that would encourage banking organizations to, among other things: evaluate the potential impact of climate-related risks on the bank s financial condition, operations and business objectives as part of its strategic planning process; account for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systemic risk assessments; revise expectations for credit portfolio concentrations based on climate-related factors; and prepare for the transition risks to the bank associated with the adjustment to a low-carbon economy and related changes in laws, regulations, governmental policies, technology, and consumer behavior and expectations. While the agencies efforts to-date have focused on banking organizations with 100 billion or more in total assets, their supervisory expectations on climate risk management practices ultimately may apply to smaller banking organizations such as the Bank. 
 
 In addition, states, such as California, are considering taking similar actions on climate-related financial risks. To the extent that federal and state regulators adopt climate-related supervisory expectations and requirements that apply to East West and the Bank, we may be required to incur compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs to conform to such expectations and requirements. 
 
 16 

Future Legislation, Regulation and Supervision Activities 
 
 New statutes, regulations and policies that contain wide-ranging proposals for altering the structures, regulations and competitive relationships of financial institutions and public companies operating in the U.S. are regularly adopted. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA enacted in August 2022, contains certain tax measures, including a corporate alternative minimum tax on large U.S. corporations, an excise tax on corporate stock buy-backs, and certain clean-energy tax provisions, which may apply to the Company. Changes to applicable statutes, regulations, and policies may change the Company s operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways, increase the Company s cost of conducting business, impede the efficiency of internal business processes, subject the Company to increased supervision activities and disclosure and reporting requirements, and restrict or expand the activities in which the Company may engage. Accordingly, such changes may have a significant influence on our operations and activities, financial condition, results of operations, growth plans or future prospects, and the overall growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits. We cannot predict whether or in what form any statute, regulation or policy will be proposed or adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by any new statute, regulation or policy.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 We are exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent to the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to our business. Our enterprise risk management ERM program incorporates risk management throughout the organization in identifying, managing, monitoring, and reporting risks. Our ERM program identifies the major risk categories in our business as: capital; market; liquidity; credit; operational; compliance; legal; strategic; and reputational. 
 
 The discussion below addresses material factors, of which we are currently aware, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. These risk factors and other forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-K relate to future events, expectations, trends, and operating periods, and involve certain factors that are subject to change, and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties should not be considered a complete discussion of all the risks and uncertainties that we might face, but are intended to highlight risks that we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and an investment in our securities. Although these risks are organized by headings and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. In addition, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition that are not presently known, that are not currently believed to be significant, or that are common to all businesses. 
 
 17 

Risks Related to Geopolitical Uncertainties 
 
 Unfavorable general economic, market, political or industry conditions, either domestically or internationally, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 Our business and results of operations are affected by the financial markets and general economic conditions globally, particularly in the U.S. and Asia, including factors such as the level and volatility of short- and long-term interest rates, inflation, deflation, home prices, collateral asset prices, unemployment and under-employment levels, market or supply chain disruption, labor shortages, bankruptcies, household income, consumer behavior, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies, liquidity of the global financial markets, the availability and cost of capital and credit, government spending and the federal debt ceiling, investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets, and sustainability of economic growth in the U.S. and Asia. The deterioration of any of these conditions could adversely affect our consumer and commercial business, securities and derivatives portfolios, the level of charge-offs and provision for credit losses, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, capital levels, liquidity, and results of operations. In addition, because our operations and the collateral securing our real estate lending portfolio are primarily concentrated in California, we may be particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in California. Any unfavorable economic, market, political, or industry conditions in California and other regions where we operate could lead to the following outcomes, among others: 
 greater than expected losses in our credit exposure due to unforeseen economic conditions, which may, in turn, adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition; 
 failure of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, or a decrease in the value of real estate collateral securing the payment of such loans, which could result in credit losses, delinquencies, foreclosures and customer bankruptcies, and in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition; 
 a decrease in deposit balances and in the demand for loans and other products and services; 
 disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including adverse actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations, which may result in an inability to borrow on favorable terms or at all from other financial institutions; 
 an adverse effect on the value of the debt securities portfolio as a result of debt defaults; and 
 a loss of confidence in the financial services industry, our market sector and the equity markets by investors, placing pressure on our stock price. 
 
 Changes in the economic and political relations between the U.S. and China, including trade policies and the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, may adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 Economic trade and political tensions, including tariffs and other punitive trade policies and disputes, between the U.S. and China pose a risk to our business and customers. The imposition of tariffs, retaliatory tariffs, or other trade restrictions on products and materials that our customers import or export could cause the prices of their products to increase, possibly reduce demand, and hence may negatively impact our customers margins and their ability to service debt. We may also experience a decrease in the demand for loans and other financial products or experience a deterioration in the credit quality of the loans extended to the customer in industry sectors that are most sensitive to the tariffs. 
 
 We face risks associated with international operations. 
 
 A substantial number of our customers have economic and cultural ties to Asia. The Bank s international presence includes four full-service branches in Hong Kong and China and five representative offices in China and Singapore. Our presence in Asia carries certain risks, including risks arising from the uncertainty regarding our ability to generate revenues from foreign operations, risks associated with leveraging and conducting business on an international basis, including among others, legal, regulatory, and tax requirements and restrictions, cross-border trade restrictions or tariffs, uncertainties regarding liability, trade barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, political and economic risks, financial risks including currency and payment risks. Further, volatility in the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges and/or a potential fall in real estate prices in China, among other things, may negatively impact asset values and the profitability and liquidity of our customers operating in this region. These risks could adversely affect the success of our international operations and could have a material adverse effect on our overall business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, we face risks that our employees and affiliates may fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing our international operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, anti-corruption laws, and other U.S. and foreign laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could, among other things, result in enforcement actions and fines against us, as well as limitations on our conduct, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 18 

Natural disasters and geopolitical events beyond our control could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 Natural disasters such as wildfires, earthquakes, extreme weather conditions, hurricanes, floods, droughts, widespread health emergencies or pandemics, and other acts of nature and geopolitical events involving political unrest, terrorism, or military conflicts could adversely affect our business operations and those of our customers and cause substantial damage and loss to real and personal property. Natural disasters and geopolitical events could impair borrowers ability to service their loans, decrease the level and duration of deposits by customers, erode the value of loan collateral, result in an increase in the amount of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, and provision for credit losses, and otherwise cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Although the primary effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have subsided, our business may continue to experience materially adverse impacts as a result of macroeconomic challenges related to the pandemic, including supply-demand imbalances, volatile energy prices, tightening monetary policy and inflation. The extent of the continuing impact of COVID-19 and any future outbreaks or other public health crises on our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. 
 
 Additionally, Russia s invasion of Ukraine has heightened geopolitical tensions, which continue to disrupt the global supply chain, and increase inflationary pressures. Instability in global economic conditions and geopolitical matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 The effects of climate change could adversely impact our operations, business and customers . 
 
 The risks of climate change can be divided into physical and transition risks. The physical risks of climate change include discrete weather events, changing climate patterns and other disruptions caused by climate change affecting the regions, countries and locations in which we or our customers have operations or other interests. Cl imate change concerns could result in transition risk. Transition risks arise from the process of adjusting to a low-carbon economy, including changes in climate policy or in the regulation of financial institutions with respect to risks posed by climate change. Transition risks could also negatively affect our customers in certain industries, which may increase our credit risk and reduce the demand by these customers for our products and services. These climate-related physical and transition risks could have a direct financial impact on our business and operations. Material adverse impacts to our customers, including declines in asset values, reduced availability of insurance, significant interruptions to business operations, and negative consequences to business models and the need to make changes in responses to those consequences could also affect us. The risks of regulatory changes and compliance and disclosure requirements related to climate change may impose operational burdens and increased compliance costs, capital requirements, or the risk of litigation, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Risks Related to Financial Matters 
 
 A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate and at a higher degree of risk from a downturn in real estate markets. 
 
 Since many of our loans are secured by real estate, a decline in the real estate markets could impact our business and financial condition. Real estate values and real estate markets are generally affected by changes in general economic conditions, fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers, changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes, regulations and policies, and natural disasters, such as wildfires and earthquakes, which are particularly prevalent in California, where a significant portion of our real estate collateral is located. If real estate values decline, the value of real estate collateral securing our loans could be significantly reduced. Our ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral would be further diminished, and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans. Furthermore, commercial real estate CRE and multifamily residential loans typically involve larger balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Since payments on these loans are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties, as well as the business and financial condition of the borrowers, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market, adverse economic conditions, or changes in applicable government regulations. Borrowers inability to repay such loans may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 19 

Our business is subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. 
 
 Our financial results depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on interest-earning assets and the interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets primarily include loans extended, securities held in our investment portfolio, and excess cash held to manage short-term liquidity. We fund our assets using deposits and borrowings. We offer interest-bearing deposit products, and a portion of our deposit balances are from noninterest-bearing products. We also enter into interest rate derivatives to manage interest rate risk exposure. The interest rates we receive on our interest-earning assets and pay on our interest-bearing liabilities could be affected by various factors, including macroeconomic challenges, Federal Reserve policies, market interest rate changes in response to inflation, competition, regulatory requirements and a change in our product mix. Changes in key variable market interest rates, such as the Federal Funds, National Prime, or Treasury rates generally impact our interest rate spread. Because of the differences in maturities and repricing characteristics of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Rising interest rates may cause our funding costs to increase at a faster pace than the yield we earn from our assets, ultimately causing our net interest margin to decrease. Higher interest rates may also result in lower loan production and increased charge-offs in certain segments of the loan portfolio. Declining interest rates could lead to higher loan refinancing activity, which, in turn, would increase the likelihood of prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities. Accordingly, changes in levels of interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest income, net interest margin, cost of deposits, loan origination volume, average loan portfolio balance, asset quality, liquidity, and overall profitability. 
 
 Inflation can have an adverse impact on our business and on our customers. 
 
 Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be worth less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. In 2022, there was a pronounced rise in inflation. Russia s invasion of Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic have led to continued global supply and demand imbalances for goods, creating upward pressure on inflation and leading the Federal Reserve to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to combat inflation. From March 2022 through December 2022, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate on seven separate occasions and signaled that it anticipates additional increases in the target range will be appropriate to lower inflation. As inflation increases, the value of our investment securities, particularly those with longer maturities, decreases, although this effect is less pronounced for floating rate instruments. Moreover, our customers are also affected by inflation and the rising costs of goods and services used in their households and businesses, which could have a negative impact on their ability to repay their loans. Further adverse changes in inflation and interest rates could negatively impact consumer and business confidence, and adversely affect the economy as well as our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Reforms to and uncertainty regarding LIBOR may adversely affect our business. 
 
 We continue to manage the transition from LIBOR to ARRs and reduce the volume of LIBOR-based products that we hold. We offer loans based on ARRs, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR and the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index, and ceased offering new loans or loan renewals based on LIBOR on January 1, 2022. We continue to actively engage with customers to modify remaining LIBOR-based product contracts and transition to a benchmark replacement prior to June 30, 2023. For additional information on the discontinuation of LIBOR, refer to Item 7. MD A Overview. 
 
 The transition from LIBOR to a new benchmark rate could result in increased operational, legal, regulatory and reputational risk. ARRs, including forms of SOFR, are relatively new and will require appropriate adjustments to systems, processes, pricing and hedging determination, legal contracts, and employee and customer education. Inadequate program oversight and investment in these areas can result in adverse performance of existing and future financial contracts and result in reduced revenue and increased operational and funding costs. 
 
 20 

Although existing LIBOR loan contracts may include fallback language that addresses what would happen if LIBOR were discontinued, customers may challenge the interpretation of the language. If unresolved, legacy LIBOR loan contracts could lead to legal action between the parties which could cause negative impacts to our revenue and reputation and increase regulatory scrutiny. Transitioned LIBOR loan contracts may result in higher or lower interest payments throughout the life of each contract as compared to under LIBOR even if transitioned under industry and federal legislative guidelines which aim for minimal economic effect on the parties. In addition, the transition from LIBOR to an ARR could adversely impact other floating-rate obligations including derivatives, debt securities, assets purchased under resale agreements resale agreements ), junior subordinated debt and assets sold under repurchase agreements repurchase agreements that were indexed to LIBOR, ultimately leading to an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We continue to monitor the risks and impacts of this transition. 
 
 The monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings. 
 
 The Federal Reserve Board regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. Its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and affect the return earned on those loans and investments, both of which in turn affect our net interest margin. They can also materially decrease the value of financial assets we hold. Federal Reserve policies may also adversely affect borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans, or could adversely create asset bubbles resulting from prolonged periods of accommodative policy. This, in turn, may result in volatile markets and rapidly declining collateral values. Changes in Federal Reserve policies are beyond our control. Consequently, the impact of these changes on our business and results of operations is difficult to predict. 
 
 Further downgrades of the U.S. credit rating, potential automatic spending cuts or a government shutdown could negatively impact our business, results of operation and financial condition. 
 
 Over the past few years, U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns have increased the possibility of additional credit rating downgrades and economic slowdowns, or a recession in the U.S. Although U.S. lawmakers have passed legislation to raise the federal debt ceiling on prior occasions, there is risk that they may not be able to come to agreement again and ratings agencies have lowered or threatened to lower the long-term sovereign credit rating on the U.S. The impact of this or any further downgrades to the U.S. government s sovereign credit rating or its perceived creditworthiness could adversely affect the U.S. and global financial markets and economic conditions. In addition, disagreement over the federal budget has caused and may cause again the U.S. federal government to essentially shut down for periods of time. Continued adverse political and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. 
 
 We are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 
 Our foreign currency translation exposure relates primarily to our China subsidiary that has its functional currency denominated in Chinese Renminbi RMB ). In addition, as we continue to expand our cross-border business, we have a higher volume of customer transactions in foreign currencies. Although we have entered into derivative instruments to offset some of the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, given the volatility of exchange rates, there is no assurance that we will be able to effectively manage foreign currency translation risk. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material unfavorable impact on our net income, therefore adversely affecting our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Capital Resources and Liquidity 
 
 As a regulated entity, we are subject to capital requirements, and a failure to meet these standards could adversely affect our financial condition. 
 
 We and the Bank are subject to certain capital and liquidity rules, including the Basel III Capital Rules, which establish the minimum capital adequacy requirements and may require us to increase our regulatory capital or liquidity targets, increase regulatory capital ratios, or change how we calculate regulatory capital. We may be required to increase our capital levels, even in the absence of actual adverse economic conditions or forecasts, and enhance capital planning based on hypothetical future adverse economic scenarios. As of December 31, 2022, we met the requirements of the Basel III Capital Rules, including the capital conservation buffer. Compliance with capital requirements may limit capital-intensive operations and increase operational costs, and we may be limited or prohibited from distributing dividends or repurchasing our stock. This could adversely affect our ability to expand or maintain present business levels, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additional information on the regulatory capital requirements applicable to us and the Bank is set forth in Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation Regulatory Capital Requirements in this Form 10-K. 
 
 21 

Our dependence on dividends from the Bank could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends. 
 
 East West is dependent on the Bank for dividends, distributions, and other payments. Our principal source of cash flows, including cash flows to pay dividends to our stockholders and principal and interest on our outstanding debt, is dividends received from the Bank. The Bank s ability to pay dividends to East West is limited by federal and California law. Subject to the Bank meeting or exceeding regulatory capital requirements, regulatory approval is required under federal law if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year would exceed the sum of the Bank s net income for that year and its retained earnings for the preceding two years. 
 
 Federal law also prohibits the Bank from paying dividends that would be greater than its undivided profits, unless the Bank has received prior approval of the Federal Reserve and of at least two-thirds of the stockholders of each class of stock. California law imposes its own limitations on capital distributions by California-charted banks that could require the Bank to obtain the approval of the DFPI prior to making a distribution to East West. In addition, Federal Reserve guidance sets forth the supervisory expectation that bank holding companies will inform and consult with the Federal Reserve in advance of issuing a dividend that exceeds earnings for the quarter and should not pay dividends in a rolling four quarter period in an amount that exceeds net income, net of distributions, for the period. Further description of regulatory requirements applicable to dividends by us and the Bank is set forth in Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation Dividends and Other Transfers of Funds in this Form 10-K. 
 
 We are subject to liquidity risk, which could negatively affect our funding levels. 
 
 Market conditions or other events could negatively affect the level of or cost of funding, which in turn could affect our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, or fund asset growth and new business initiatives at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences. Although we have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated changes in assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet commitments under various economic conditions, a substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If the cost effectiveness or the availability of supply in the credit markets is reduced for a prolonged period of time, our funding needs may require us to access funding and manage liquidity by other means. These alternatives may include generating client deposits, securitizing or selling loans, and further managing loan growth and investment opportunities. These alternative means of funding may not be available under stressed market conditions or realized in a timely fashion. 
 
 Any downgrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, cost of funding, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Credit rating agencies evaluate us regularly, and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength, capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality and ability to generate earnings. Some of these factors are not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry as a whole. Severe downgrades in credit ratings could impact our business and reduce our profitability in different ways, including a reduction in our access to capital markets, triggering additional collateral or funding obligations which could negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, our counterparties, as well as our clients, rely on our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us, on a regular basis. If we experience a decline in our credit ratings, this could result in a decrease in the number of counterparties and clients who may be willing to transact with us. Our borrowing costs may also be affected by various external factors, including market volatility and concerns or perceptions about the financial services industry. There can be no assurance that we can maintain our credit ratings nor that they will not be changed in the future.

Risks Related to Credit Matters 
 
 Our allowance for credit losses level may not be adequate to cover actual losses. 
 
 In accordance with the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP ), we establish an allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. Our allowance for loan losses is based on our evaluation of risks associated with our loans held-for-investment portfolio, including historical loss experience, current borrower characteristics, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, delinquencies, performing status, the size and composition of the loan portfolio, and concentrations within the portfolio. The allowance estimation process requires subjective and complex judgments, including analysis of economic conditions and how these economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. Current economic conditions in the U.S. and in the international markets could further deteriorate, which could result in, among other things, greater than expected deterioration in credit quality of our loan portfolio or in the value of collateral securing these loans. Our allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to absorb actual credit losses, and future provisions for credit losses could materially and adversely affect our operating results. The amount of future losses is influenced by changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates that may be beyond our control, and such losses may exceed current estimates. 
 
 Additionally, in order to maximize the collection of loan balances, we sometimes modify loan terms. If such modifications ultimately are less effective at mitigating loan losses than we expect, we may incur losses in excess of the specific amount of allowance for loan losses associated with a modified loan, which would result in additional provision for loan losses. In addition, we establish a reserve for losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments. The level of the allowance for unfunded credit commitments is determined by following a methodology similar to that used to establish our allowance for loan losses in our loans held-for-investment portfolio. There can be no assurance that our allowance for unfunded credit commitments will be adequate to provide for the actual losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments. An increase in the allowance for unfunded credit commitments in any period may result in a charge to earnings and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 We may be subject to increased credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral. 
 
 Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans are concentrated in borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities, industries, or geographies or to borrowers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions, which could result in materially higher credit losses. For example, the Bank has a concentration of real estate loans in California. Potential deterioration in the California commercial or residential real estate markets or economic conditions could result in additional loan charge-offs and provision for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If any industry or market sector were to experience economic difficulties, loan collectability from customers operating in those industries or sectors may deteriorate, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Operations 
 
 A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third-party vendors, could disrupt our business, and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and liquidity, as well as damage our reputation. 
 
 We face risks of loss resulting from, but not limited to, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirement, the risk of fraud by employees or third parties, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, business continuation, and disaster recovery. In the event of such operational failures, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action, and suffer damage to our reputation. 
 
 23 

The potential for operational loss exposure exists throughout our organization and among our interactions with third parties. Our operational, security systems, and infrastructure, as well as those of third-party vendors, are integral to our performance. We have taken measures to implement backup systems and safeguards to support our operations, but our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or our vendors. Our operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or may become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide certain services. These factors include, and are not limited to, electrical, telecommunications, or other major physical infrastructure outages, disease pandemics, natural disasters such as wildfires, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and floods, and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts. Furthermore, we frequently update these systems to support our operations and growth, requiring significant costs and creating risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. 
 
 Third parties that facilitate our business activities could also be sources of operational and security risks to us. Our ability to implement backup systems or other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is limited. Furthermore, an attack on or failure of a third-party system may not be revealed to us in a timely manner, which could compromise our ability to respond effectively. Some of these third parties may engage vendors of their own, which introduces the risk that these fourth parties could be the source of operational and security failures. In addition, if a third party or fourth party obtains access to the customer account data on our systems, and that party experiences a breach or misappropriates such data, we and our customers could suffer material harm, including heightened risk of fraudulent transactions, losses from fraudulent transactions, increased operational costs to remediate any security breach, and reputational harm. 
 
 Our business and many of our customers may have experienced, and may experience again in the future, losses incurred due to fraud or theft related to customers, employees, or third parties. These losses may be material and negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition, reputation or prospects. Increased use of the internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and operations, coupled with the increased sophistication and activities of threat actors increases our security risks. 
 
 These operational risk exposures, if realized, could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and liquidity, and may result in loss of confidence, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation. These risks are expected to continue to increase as we expand our interconnectivity with our customers and other third parties. 
 
 A cyber-attack, information or security breach, or a technology failure of our systems or of a third party s systems could adversely affect our ability to conduct business, manage our exposure to risk or expand our business, and could also result in the misuse of confidential information, increase our costs to maintain and update our operational and security systems and infrastructure, and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, as well as cause reputational harm. 
 
 Our business is highly dependent on the security and efficacy of our infrastructure, computer and data management systems, as well as those of third parties with which we interact. Cyber security risks, including ransomware and malware attacks, for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunication technologies to conduct financial transactions, the significant increased use of remote workstations by employees due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, and other threat actors. Our business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary, and other information in our computer email and data management systems and networks, including those of our third party vendors. Although we employ a combination of preventative and detective controls to safeguard against cyber-attacks and have not experienced any known cyber-attacks on our systems resulting in material system failures or breaches to date, we can provide no assurance that all of our security measures will be effective, especially since the industry has seen an increase in ransomware attacks, data breaches, social engineering, phishing attacks, and internet scams that have placed the Bank, employees, our customers, and third party vendors at heightened risk levels. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our digital product offerings and expand our internal usage of cloud-based products and applications. In addition, our customers often use their own devices to make payments and manage their accounts, and are subject to cyber-attacks. We have limited ability to assure the safety and security of our customers transactions with us to the extent they are using their own devices. 
 
 Failure to mitigate breaches of security, or to comply with frequent imposition of increasingly demanding new and changing industry standards and regulatory requirements, could result in violation of applicable privacy laws, reputational damage, regulatory fines, litigation exposure, increased security compliance costs, adversely affect our ability to offer and grow the online services, and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 24 

Failure to keep pace with technological change could adversely affect our business. We may face risks associated with the utilization of information technology systems to support our operations effectively. 
 
 The financial services industry is continuously undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services, including financial technology and non-banking entities. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological solutions. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we do not implement systems effectively or if our outsourcing business partners do not perform their functions properly, there could be an adverse effect on us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively maintain or improve our systems and processes, or utilize outsourced talent, to meet our business needs successfully. Any such failure could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation. 
 
 We could face material legal and reputational harm if we fail to safeguard personal information. 
 
 We are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations, both inside and outside the U.S., governing the privacy and protection of personal information. Individuals whose personal information may be protected by law can include our customers (and in some cases our customers customers), prospective customers, job applicants, employees, and the employees of our suppliers, and third parties. Complying with laws and regulations applicable to our collection, use, transfer, and storage of personal information can increase operating costs, impact the development and marketing of new products or services, and reduce operational efficiency. Any mishandling or misuse of personal information by us or a third party affiliated with us could expose us to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. 
 
 The actions and soundness of other financial institutions could affect us. 
 
 Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We execute transactions with various counterparties in the financial industry, including broker-dealers, commercial banks, and investment banks. Defaults by financial services institutions and uncertainty in the financial services industry in general could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and may expose us to credit risk. Further, our credit risk may increase when the underlying collateral held cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. Any such losses could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 Our controls and procedures could fail or be circumvented. 
 
 Management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurances of the effectiveness of these systems and controls, and that the objectives of these controls have been met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures, and any failure to comply with regulations or supervisory expectations related to controls and procedures could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 We are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects. 
 
 Competition for qualified personnel in the banking industry is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of, and experience in, the regional banking industry, especially in the West Coast markets, and in international banking operations, especially in Asia. The process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our strategies is often lengthy. Our success depends, to a significant degree, on our ability to attract and retain qualified management, loan origination, finance, administrative, marketing, and technical personnel, as well as the continued contributions of those individuals. In particular, our success has been and continues to be highly dependent upon the abilities of certain key executives. Accordingly, we believe that our future success is dependent upon the development and, when needed, implementation of adequate succession plans. Although both the Board of Directors and management monitor our succession planning for our senior management team, unexpected departures of key personnel or disruptions in future leadership transitions could negatively impact our business and prospects. 
 25 

We face strong competition in the financial services industry, and we could lose business or suffer margin declines as a result. 
 
 We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors include, but are not limited to, commercial banks, savings and loan associations, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banks, nonbank financial institutions, and other regional, national, and global financial institutions. Some of our major competitors include multinational financial service companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Areas of competition include interest rates on loans and deposits, customer services, and range of price and quality of products and services, including new technology-driven products and services. Ongoing or increased competition may put pressure on the pricing for our products and services or may cause us to lose market share, particularly with respect to traditional banking products such as loans and deposits. Failure to attract and retain banking customers may adversely impact our loan and deposit growth and in turn, our revenues. 
 
 We have engaged in and may continue to engage in further expansion through acquisitions, which could cause disruption to our business and may dilute existing stockholders interests. 
 
 There are risks associated with expanding through acquisitions. These risks include, among others, incorrectly assessing the asset quality of a bank acquired in a particular transaction, incurring greater than anticipated costs in integrating acquired business, failing to retain customers or employees, and the inability to profitably deploy assets acquired or realize synergies from a transaction. Additional country or region-specific risks are associated with transactions outside the U.S., including in China. To the extent we issue capital stock in connection with additional transactions, these transactions and related stock issuances may have a dilutive effect on earnings per share and share ownership. 
 
 Our investments in certain tax-advantaged projects may not generate returns as anticipated and may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 
 
 We invest in certain tax-advantaged investments that support qualified affordable housing projects, community development, and renewable energy resources. Our investments in these projects are designed to generate a return in part through the realization of federal and state income tax credits, and other tax benefits, over specified time periods. We are subject to the risk that previously recorded tax credits, which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at the project level, may fail to meet certain government compliance requirements and may not be able to be realized. The risk of not being able to realize, or of subsequently incurring a recapture of, the tax credits and other tax benefits depends on various factors, some of which are outside of our control, including changes in the applicable tax code, as well as the continued economic viability of the project and project operator. The possible inability to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits would have a negative impact on our financial results. 
 
 Risks Related to Regulatory, Compliance and Legal Matters 
 
 Changes in regulation may require us to change our business practices, increase costs, limit our ability to make investments and generate revenue, or otherwise adversely affect business operations and/or competitiveness. 
 
 We are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws, as well as supervision and examination by the DFPI, FDIC, Federal Reserve, SEC, CFPB in the U.S. and foreign regulators and other government authorities. We are also subject to enforcement oversight by the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general. In addition, we face certain legal, reputational, and financial risks as a result of serving customers in new or evolving industries that are subject to changing, and at times conflicting laws, such as digital currency and cannabis related businesses. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, or policies could affect the manner in which we conduct business. Such changes could also subject us to additional costs and may limit the types of financial services and products we offer, and the investments we make. 
 
 26 

Given that banks operate in an extensively regulated environment under federal and state law, good standing with our regulators is of fundamental importance to the continuation and growth of our business. In the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties, the U.S. federal and state regulators, and non-U.S. regulators, have significant discretion and power to initiate enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations, and unsafe and unsound practices. Further, regulators and bank supervisors continue to exercise qualitative supervision of our industry and specific business operations and related matters. Violations of laws and regulations or deemed deficiencies in risk management or other qualitative practices also may be incorporated into our bank supervisory ratings. A downgrade in these ratings, or other enforcement actions or supervisory criticisms, could limit our ability to pursue acquisitions or conduct other expansionary activities and require new or additional regulatory approvals before engaging in certain other business activities, as well as result in civil monetary penalties, other sanctions, and damage to our reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. 
 
 Failure to comply with laws, regulations, or policies could result in civil or criminal sanctions by U.S. federal and state, and non-U.S. agencies, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of our banking charter, civil or criminal monetary penalties, and/or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We continue to adjust our business and operations, capital, policies, procedures, and controls to comply with these laws and regulations, final rulemaking, and interpretations from the regulatory authorities. See Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation in this Form 10-K for more information about the regulations to which we are subject. 
 
 Changes to fiscal policies and tax legislation may adversely affect our business. 
 
 From time to time, the U.S. government may introduce new fiscal policies and tax laws or make substantial changes to existing tax legislation. These changes could have a material impact on our business and our customers business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our positions or our actions taken prior to such changes, may be compromised by such changes. In addition, our actions taken in response to, or in reliance upon, such changes in the tax laws may impact our tax position in a manner that may result in an adverse financial condition. We also provide for current and deferred taxes in our financial statements, based on our results of operations and financial condition. We may take tax return filing positions for which the final determination of tax is uncertain, and our income tax expense could be increased if a federal, state, or local authority were to assess additional taxes that have not been provided for in our consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that we will achieve our anticipated effective tax rate. The U.S. government could further introduce new tax legislation or amend current tax laws in a manner that would adversely affect us. In addition, the U.S. President s proposed budget, negotiations with Congress over the details of the budget, and the terms of the approved budget could create uncertainty about the U.S. economy, ultimately having an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 Complying with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering and sanctions statutes and regulations can increase our compliance costs and risks. 
 
 The BSA, the PATRIOT Act, and other laws and regulations require us and other financial institutions to institute and maintain an effective AML program and file suspicious activity reports and currency transaction reports when appropriate. We may provide banking services to customers considered to be higher risk customers, which subjects us to greater enforcement risk under the BSA and requires us to ensure our third-party vendors adhere to the BSA and related regulations. FinCEN may impose significant civil monetary penalties for violations of those requirements and has been engaging in coordinated enforcement efforts with the federal and state banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Internal Revenue Service. 
 
 We are also required to comply with the U.S. economic and trade sanctions administered by the OFAC regarding, among other things, the prohibition of transacting business with, and the need to freeze assets of, certain persons and organizations identified as a threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the U.S. A violation of any AML or OFAC-related law or regulation could subject us to significant civil and criminal penalties as well as regulatory enforcement actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including any acquisition plans. Any of these violations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, reputation, and future prospects. 
 
 27 

We are subject to significant financial and reputational risk arising from lawsuits and other legal proceedings. 
 
 We operate in a heavily regulated industry and face significant risk from lawsuits and claims brought by consumers, borrowers, and counterparties. These actions include claims for monetary damages, penalties, and fines, as well as demands for injunctive relief. If these lawsuits or claims, whether founded or unfounded, are not resolved in a favorable manner to us, they could lead to significant financial obligations for us, as well as restrictions or changes to how we conduct our business. Although we establish accruals for legal matters when and as required by U.S. GAAP and certain expenses and liabilities in connection with such matters may or may not be covered by insurance, the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher than the amounts accrued and/or insured. Substantial legal liability could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, we may suffer significant reputational harm as a result of lawsuits and claims, adversely impacting our ability to attract and retain customers and investors. Moreover, it may be difficult to predict the outcome of certain legal proceedings, which may present additional uncertainty to our business prospects. 
 
 General Risk Factors 
 
 Changes in accounting standards or changes in how the accounting standards are interpreted or applied could materially impact our financial statements. 
 
 The preparation of our financial statements is based on accounting standards established by the FASB and the SEC. From time to time, these accounting standards may change, and such changes may have a material impact on our financial statements. In addition, the FASB, SEC, banking regulators, and our independent registered public accounting firm may amend or reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various standards should be applied. These changes may be difficult to predict and could impact how we prepare and report our financial statements. In some cases, we could be required to adopt a new or revised standard retroactively, potentially resulting in restatements to a prior period s financial statements. 
 
 Our consolidated financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which, if incorrect, could cause unexpected losses in the future. 
 
 Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including in determining the allowance for credit loss, accrued liability for litigation, and the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, among other items. Our assumptions and estimates may be inaccurate or subjective, particularly in times of market stress or under unforeseen circumstances. Inaccurate assumptions or inadequate design of our forecasting models could result in incorrect or misleading information, and in turn could lead to inappropriate business decisions, such as an inadequate reserve for credit losses, and adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our significant accounting policies and use of estimates are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. Some accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. In addition, some significant accounting policies require significant judgments in applying complex accounting principles to individual transactions and determining the most appropriate treatment. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. For a description of these policies, refer to Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7. MD A Critical Accounting Estimates in this Form 10-K. 
 
 Impairment of goodwill could result in a charge against earnings and thus a reduction in stockholders equity. 
 
 We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently, if necessary. A significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a material change in interest rates, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates, or a significant or sustained decline in the price of our common stock may necessitate taking future charges related to the impairment of goodwill. If we determine that a future write-down of goodwill is necessary, the amount of such impairment charge could be significant and could adversely affect earnings as well as capital. 
 
 28 

Anti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our stockholders. 
 
 Provisions of Delaware and California law and of our certificate of incorporation, as amended, and bylaws, as amended and restated, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or could have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. For example, our certificate of incorporation, as amended, requires the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of voting stock to approve certain business combinations. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which would make it more difficult for another party to acquire us without the approval of the Board of Directors. Additionally, our certificate of incorporation, as amended, authorizes the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock which could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal. 
 
 Additionally, prior approval of the Federal Reserve and the DFPI is required for any person to acquire control of us, and control for these purposes may be presumed to exist when a person owns 10 or more of our outstanding common stock. Federal Reserve approval is also required for a bank holding company to acquire more than 5 of our outstanding common stock. These and other provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of the stockholders. 
 
 Managing reputational risk is important to attracting and maintaining customers, investors, and employees. 
 
 Threats to our reputation can come from many sources, including unethical practices, employee misconduct, failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality, compliance deficiencies, and questionable or fraudulent activities of our customers. We have policies and procedures, including our Code of Conduct, in place to govern the personal conduct, action and work relationship of our employees with customers, fellow employees, competitors, governmental officials, and suppliers under both official and unofficial situations, in which employees may reasonably be perceived by others as acting as representatives of us. In addition, employees who fail to comply with the Code of Conduct may be subject to disciplinary action, termination of employment, and/or prosecution. However, these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Negative publicity regarding our business, employees or customers, with or without merit, may result in the loss of customers, investors and employees, costly litigation, a decline in revenues and increased governmental scrutiny. 
 
 Increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations may expose us to additional costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on our business. 
 
 Regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance ESG practices relating to business, including climate change, human rights, health and safety, diversity, and labor conditions. Any failure to comply with regulatory requirements, or to meet evolving investor or stakeholder expectations and standards, could result in legal and regulatory proceedings and negatively impact our business, reputation, results of operations, financial conditions, and stock price. New government regulations could also cause new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosures. 
 
 The price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline. 
 
 The price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to various factors, some of which are outside our control. These factors include the risk factors discussed herein, as well as: 
 actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition; 
 changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts and rating agencies; 
 speculation in the press or investment community; 
 strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings; 
 actions by institutional stockholders; 
 addition or departure of key personnel; 
 fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors; 
 general market conditions and, in particular, market conditions in the financial services industry; 
 proposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments; 
 cyclical fluctuations; 
 trading volume of our common stock; and 
 anticipated or pending investigations, proceedings or litigation that involve or affect us. 
 
 29 

Industry factors, general economic and political conditions and events, such as cyber or terrorist attacks, economic downturn or recessions, interest rate changes, credit default trends, currency fluctuations, changes to fiscal, monetary or trade policies, or public health issues could also cause our stock price to decline regardless of our operating results. A significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for stockholders.

Overview 
 
 The following discussion provides information about the results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of the Company, and its subsidiaries, including its subsidiary bank, East West Bank. This information is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the Company s results of operations and financial condition. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

 Current Developments 
 
 Economic Developments 
 
 Heightened inflationary concerns continue to weigh on the economy. The Federal Reserve s tight monetary policy has included multiple interest rate hikes to slow the pace of inflation, which boosted the value of the USD. Meanwhile, global supply chain disruptions persist due to a variety of factors, including Russia s invasion of Ukraine and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The combination of higher interest rates, depressed global equity prices, elevated market volatility and a slowdown in global economies have led to concerns of a potential recession. The Company continues to closely monitor the economy and its effects on its business, customers, employees, communities and markets. 
 
 Further discussion of the potential impacts on the Company s business due to interest rate hikes have been provided in Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Financial Matters in this Form 10-K. 
 
 LIBOR Transition 
 
 LIBOR was a widely referenced benchmark rate intended to reflect the rate at which banks could borrow wholesale funds from other banks on an unsecured and short-term basis. In March 2021, the United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority and Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration announced that the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR settings and non-USD LIBOR settings would cease to be published after December 31, 2021. The publication of the overnight, one-, three-, six- and 12-month USD LIBOR settings has been extended through June 30, 2023. 
 
 In March 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the LIBOR Act was signed into law. The LIBOR Act provides a uniform, nationwide solution for so-called tough legacy contracts that do not have clear and practicable provisions for replacing LIBOR after June 30, 2023. The LIBOR Act also establishes a litigation safe harbor for lenders that have the discretion to select a LIBOR replacement under certain situations, including the use of a Federal Reserve-selected replacement rate based on SOFR. On December 16, 2022, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule that implements the LIBOR Act by identifying benchmark rates based on SOFR that will replace LIBOR in certain financial contracts after June 30, 2023. 
 
 The Company holds a significant volume of LIBOR-based products that are indexed to tenors that will cease to be published after June 30, 2023. The volume of these products continues to decrease as the Company works through the transition. A cross-functional team was created to manage this transition and communicate with both internal and external stakeholders. The Company developed and updated business and legal processes, contract language, and models, as well as invested in analytical tools and information and operational systems to facilitate the transition of legacy LIBOR products to ARRs. 
 
 34 

The Company offers loans based on ARRs, such as SOFR and the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index. The Company ceased offering new loans or loan renewals based on LIBOR on January 1, 2022. The Company continues to engage with customers to proactively modify the remaining LIBOR-based product contracts and transition to a benchmark replacement prior to June 30, 2023. The Company will leverage relevant contractual and statutory solutions, if necessary, including the LIBOR Act and other relevant legislation, to transition any residual LIBOR-based product exposures maturing after June 2023 to appropriate benchmark replacements. The Company s LIBOR transition is anticipated to continue through June 30, 2023. 
 
 The Company will continue to monitor the risks and impacts of this transition. For additional information related to the potential impact surrounding the transition from LIBOR on the Company s business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Financial Matters in this Form 10-K. 

Our MD A analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of the Company for 2022 and 2021. Some tables include additional periods to comply with disclosure requirements or to illustrate trends in greater depth. When reading the discussion in the MD A, readers should also refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in this Form 10-K. The page locations of specific sections that we refer to are presented in the table of contents. To review our financial condition and results of operations for 2021 and a comparison between 2021 and 2020 results, see Item 7. MD A of our 2021 Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on February 28, 2022.

 (2) Efficiency ratio is calculated as noninterest expense divided by total revenue . 
 
 The Company s 2022 net income was 1.13 billion, an increase of 255.1 million, or 29 , from 2021 net income of 873.0 million. The increase was primarily due to higher net interest income, partially offset by increases in the provision for credit losses and income tax expense. Noteworthy items about the Company s performance for 2022 included: 
 
 Net interest income growth and net interest margin expansion. Year-over-year net interest income before provision for (reversal of) credit losses grew by 514.3 million or 34 to 2.05 billion in 2022, from 1.53 billion in 2021. Full year 2022 net interest margin was 3.45 , up 73 bps year-over-year. 
 
 Expanding profitability. The Company s 2022 ROA, ROE and tangible return on average tangible equity of 1.80 , 19.51 and 21.29 , respectively, all expanded year-over-year by 33 bps, 381 bps and 405 bps, respectively. Tangible return on average tangible equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. For additional details, see the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures presented under Item 7. MD A Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-K.

Improved efficiency. Efficiency ratio of 36.65 and adjusted efficiency ratio of 31.74 in 2022 both improved year-over-year. Adjusted efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure. For additional details, see the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures presented under Item 7. MD A Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-K. 
 
 Asset growth. Total assets reached 64.11 billion, growing 3.24 billion or 5 year-over-year, primarily driven by loan growth. 
 
 Loan growth. Total loans were 48.23 billion as of December 31, 2022, a year-over-year increase of 6.53 billion or 16 from 41.69 billion. This was primarily driven by well-balanced growth in the CRE, residential mortgage and commercial and industrial C I loan segments. 
 
 Deposit growth. Total deposits were 55.97 billion as of December 31, 2022, a year-over-year increase of 2.62 billion or 5 from 53.35 billion, primarily driven by growth in time deposits, partially offset by decreases in noninterest-bearing demand and money market deposits.

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income 
 
 The Company s primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the interest income earned on interest-earning assets less interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average interest-earning assets. Net interest income and net interest margin are impacted by several factors, including changes in average balances and the composition of interest-earning assets and funding sources, market interest rate fluctuations and the slope of the yield curve, repricing characteristics and maturity of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the volume of noninterest-bearing sources of funds and asset quality. 

Net interest income before provision for (reversal of) credit losses in 2022 was 2.05 billion, an increase of 514.3 million or 34 , compared with 1.53 billion in 2021. Net interest margin was 3.45 in 2022, an increase of 73 bps from 2.72 in 2021. The year-over-year changes in net interest income and net interest margin primarily reflected higher interest-earning asset yields and strong loan growth, partially offset by a higher average cost of deposits. The changes in yields and rates reflected rising benchmark interest rates. 
 37 

Average interest-earning assets were 59.31 billion in 2022, an increase of 3.05 billion or 5 from 56.26 billion in 2021. The increase in average interest-earning assets primarily reflected growth in loans and debt securities, partially offset by a decrease in interest-bearing cash and deposits with banks. 
 
 The yield on average interest-earning assets was 3.91 in 2022, an increase of 103 bps from 2.88 in 2021. The year-over-year increase in the yield on average interest-earning assets primarily resulted from rising benchmark interest rates. 

The average loan yield was 4.52 in 2022, an increase of 93 bps from 3.59 in 2021. The year-over-year change in the average loan yield reflected the loan portfolio s sensitivity to rising benchmark interest rates. Approximately 62 and 66 of loans held-for-investment were variable-rate or hybrid loans in their adjustable-rate period as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

38 

Deposits are an important source of funds and impact both net interest income and net interest margin. Average deposits were 54.30 billion in 2022, an increase of 2.82 billion or 5 from 51.48 billion in 2021. Average noninterest-bearing deposits were 22.78 billion, an increase of 1.51 billion or 7 from 21.27 billion in 2021. Average noninterest-bearing deposits made up 42 and 41 of average deposits for 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 The average cost of deposits was 0.46 in 2022, an increase of 33 bps from 0.13 in 2021. The year-over-year increase reflected higher rates paid on money market and time deposits in response to the rising interest rate environment. 
 
 The average cost of funds calculation includes deposits, FHLB advances, repurchase agreements, long-term debt and short-term borrowings. In 2022, the average cost of funds was 0.50 , an increase of 33 bps from 0.17 in 2021. The year-over-year increase was mainly driven by the change in the average cost of deposits discussed above. 
 
 The Company utilizes various tools to manage interest rate risk. Refer to the Interest Rate Risk Management section of Item 7. MD A Risk Management Market Risk Management for details.

Noninterest Income 
 
 The following table presents the components of noninterest income for the periods indicated: 
 in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change from 2021 2020 Lending fees 79,208 77,704 2 74,842 Deposit account fees 88,435 71,261 24 48,148 Interest rate contracts and other derivative income 29,057 22,913 27 31,685 Foreign exchange income 48,158 48,977 (2) 22,370 Wealth management fees 27,565 25,751 7 17,494 Net gains on sales of loans 6,411 8,909 (28) 4,501 Gains on sales of AFS debt securities 1,306 1,568 (17) 12,299 Other investment income 7,037 16,852 (58) 10,641 Other income 11,489 11,960 (4) 13,567 Total noninterest income 298,666 285,895 4 235,547 
 
 Noninterest income comprised 13 and 16 of total revenue in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Noninterest income for 2022 was 298.7 million, an increase of 12.8 million or 4 , compared with 285.9 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to growth in deposit account fees, and interest rate contracts and other derivative income, partially offset by a decrease in other investment income. 
 41 

Deposit account fees were 88.4 million in 2022, an increase of 17.2 million or 24 , compared with 71.3 million in 2021. This growth was primarily driven by higher treasury management and deposit-related fees from commercial deposits. 
 
 Interest rate contracts and other derivative income was 29.1 million in 2022, an increase of 6.1 million or 27 , compared with 22.9 million in 2021. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to favorable credit valuation adjustments and higher transaction volume, which drove growth in interest rate contract premiums. 
 
 Other investment income was 7.0 million in 2022, a decrease of 9.8 million or 58 , compared with 16.9 million in 2021. The decrease primarily reflected unfavorable equity valuation adjustments in the Company s CRA investments in 2022, compared with the prior year. 

Noninterest Expense 
 
 The following table presents the components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated: 
 Year Ended December 31, in thousands) 2022 2021 Change from 2021 2020 Compensation and employee benefits 477,635 433,728 10 404,071 Occupancy and equipment expense 62,501 62,996 (1) 66,489 Deposit insurance premiums and regulatory assessments 19,449 17,563 11 15,128 Deposit account expense 25,508 16,152 58 13,530 Data processing 14,517 16,263 (11) 16,603 Computer software expense 28,259 30,600 (8) 29,033 Other operating expense 118,166 96,330 23 92,646 Amortization of tax credit and other investments 113,358 122,457 (7) 70,082 Repurchase agreements extinguishment cost 8,740 Total noninterest expense 859,393 796,089 8 716,322 
 
 Noninterest expense was 859.4 million in 2022, an increase of 63.3 million or 8 , compared with 796.1 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits, other operating expense, and deposit account expense, partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of tax credit and other investments. 
 
 Compensation and employee benefits were 477.6 million in 2022, an increase of 43.9 million or 10 , compared with 433.7 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher average compensation. 
 
 Other operating expense was 118.2 million in 2022, an increase of 21.8 million or 23 , compared with 96.3 million in 2021. This increase was primarily due to higher interest expense on cash collateral, foreclosure and travel-related expenses, and miscellaneous operating losses, partially offset by lower legal expenses. 
 
 Deposit account expense was 25.5 million in 2022, an increase of 9.4 million or 58 , compared with 16.2 million in 2021. The increase primarily reflected higher deposit referral fees and commercial customer account expenses. 
 
 Amortization of tax credit and other investments was 113.4 million in 2022, a decrease of 9.1 million or 7 , compared with 122.5 million in 2021. The year-over-year change largely reflected investments that close in a given period and the mix of tax credits being recognized, all of which have differing amortization periods.

Income Taxes 
 
 The following table presents the income before income taxes, income tax expense and effective tax rate for the periods indicated: 
 in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Income before income taxes 1,411,654 1,056,377 685,765 Income tax expense 283,571 183,396 117,968 Effective tax rate 20.1 17.4 17.2 
 
 Income tax expense was 283.6 million in 2022, compared with 183.4 million in 2021, resulting in an effective tax rate of 20.1 and 17.4 , respectively. The increase in the income tax expense was primarily related to an increase in pre-tax net income and a decrease in tax credits. The differences between the 2022 and 2021 effective tax rates from the federal statutory rate of 21 were primarily due to tax credits associated with renewable energy, historic and new market tax credit related projects and state taxes as described in Note 11 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

Operating Segment Results 
 
 The Company organizes its operations into three reportable operating segments: (1) Consumer and Business Banking; (2) Commercial Banking; and (3) Other.

 Consumer and Business Banking segment net income increased 299.5 million or 97 year-over-year to 608.1 million in 2022, due to revenue growth, partially offset by higher income tax expense, noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. Net interest income before provision for credit losses increased 473.7 million or 68 year-over-year to 1.17 billion. The increase was primarily driven by higher deposit fund transfer pricing credits due to noninterest-bearing deposit growth, and higher loan interest income, mainly from growth in residential mortgage loans. Noninterest income increased 16.0 million or 17 to 110.1 million, primarily driven by higher deposit account fees and foreign exchange income. Provision for credit losses increased 32.2 million, or 644 , year-over-year to 27.2 million, primarily driven by changes to the macroeconomic outlook and mortgage loan growth. Noninterest expense increased 33.2 million, or 9 , to 397.9 million, primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits and allocated corporate overhead expenses . 
 
 Commercial Banking 
 
 The Commercial Banking segment primarily generates commercial loan and deposit products. Commercial loan products include CRE lending, construction finance, commercial business lending, working capital lines of credit, trade finance, letters of credit, affordable housing lending, asset-based lending, asset-backed finance, project finance and equipment financing. Commercial deposit products and other financial services include treasury management, foreign exchange services and interest rate and commodity risk hedging.

 44 

Commercial Banking segment net income increased 18.2 million, or 4 , year-over-year to 507.5 million in 2022. This increase reflected revenue growth, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. Net interest income before provision for credit losses increased 126.2 million, or 16 , to 892.4 million, driven by higher loan interest income from commercial loan growth. Noninterest income increased 15.5 million, or 9 , to 179.2 million, primarily driven by higher interest rate contracts and other derivative income, deposit account fees and foreign exchange income. Provision for credit losses increased 76.3 million, or 254 , year-over-year to 46.3 million, primarily driven by changes to the macroeconomic outlook and commercial loan growth. Noninterest expense increased 38.5 million, or 14 , to 314.2 million, primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits, other operating expenses and allocated corporate overhead expenses. 
 
 Other 
 
 Centralized functions, including the corporate treasury activities of the Company and eliminations of inter-segment amounts, have been aggregated and included in the Other segment, which provides broad administrative support to the two core segments, namely the Consumer and Business Banking and the Commercial Banking segments. 
 
 The following table presents additional financial information for the Other segment for the periods indicated: 
 in thousands) Year Ended December 31, Change from 2021 2022 2021 2020 Net interest (loss) income (17,355) 68,268 (85,623) (125) 140,078 Noninterest income 9,279 28,002 (18,723) (67) 29,095 Total (loss) revenue (8,076) 96,270 (104,346) (108) 169,173 Noninterest expense 147,326 155,805 (8,479) (5) 117,649 Segment loss before income taxes (155,402) (59,535) (95,867) 161 51,524 Income tax benefit (167,898) (134,653) (33,245) 25 (62,015) Segment net income 12,496 75,118 (62,622) (83) 113,539 Average deposits 3,744,822 2,681,097 1,063,725 40 2,750,134 
 
 The Other segment reported segment loss before income taxes of 155.4 million and segment net income of 12.5 million, reflecting an income tax benefit of 167.9 million in 2022. The increase in segment loss before income taxes was primarily driven by lower revenue. The 85.6 million year-over-year decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by lower FTP spread income absorbed by the Other segment, partially offset by an increase in interest income from investments due to a higher debt securities yield in 2022. 
 
 The income tax expense or benefit in the Other segment consists of the remaining unallocated income tax expense or benefit after allocating income tax expense to the two core segments, and reflects the impact of tax credit investment activity. Income tax expense is allocated to the Consumer and Business Banking and the Commercial Banking segments by applying statutory income tax rates to the segment income before income taxes. Tax credit investment amortization is allocated to the Other segment. 

Balance Sheet Analysis 

Debt Securities 
 
 The Company maintains a portfolio of high quality and liquid debt securities with a moderate duration profile. It closely manages the overall portfolio interest rate and liquidity risks. The Company s debt securities provide: 
 interest income for earnings and yield enhancement; 
 availability for funding needs arising during the normal course of business; 
 the ability to execute interest rate risk management strategies in response to changes in economic or market conditions; and 
 collateral to support pledging agreements as required and/or to enhance the Company s borrowing capacity. 
 
 While the Company does not intend to sell its debt securities, it may sell AFS securities in response to changes in the balance sheet and related interest rate risk to meet liquidity, regulatory and strategic requirements.

 (1) Credit ratings express opinions about the credit quality of a debt security. The Company determines the credit rating of a security according to the lowest credit rating made available by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations NRSROs ). Debt securities rated investment grade, which are those with ratings similar to BBB- or above (as defined by NRSROs), are generally considered by the rating agencies and market participants to be low credit risk. Ratings percentages are allocated based on fair value. 
 (2) For debt securities not rated by NRSROs, the Company uses other factors which include but are not limited to the priority in collections within the securitization structure, and whether the contractual payments have historically been on time. 
 
 As of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, 98 of the carrying value of the Company s debt securities portfolio was rated investment grade by NRSROs. 
 
 The Company s AFS and HTM debt securities portfolio had an effective duration, defined as the sensitivity of the value of the portfolio to interest rate changes, of 5.2 as of December 31, 2022. This increased from 5.0 as of December 31, 2021, primarily due to the upshifting of the yield curve while the portfolio has seasoned. 
 
 Available-for-Sale Debt Securities 
 
 The fair value of AFS debt securities totaled 6.03 billion as of December 31, 2022, a decrease of 3.93 billion or 39 from 9.97 billion as of December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the Company s transfer of 3.01 billion of AFS securities to HTM securities during the first quarter of 2022, and a decline in the portfolio valuation within the rising interest rate environment. For further discussion regarding the transfer, refer to the Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities section below. The Company s AFS debt securities are carried at fair value with non-credit related unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in Other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Pre-tax net unrealized losses on AFS debt securities were 844.2 million as of December 31, 2022, compared with 121.8 million as of December 31, 2021. 
 
 46 

As of December 31, 2022, 97 of the carrying value of the AFS debt securities portfolio was rated investment grade by NRSROs, compared with 98 as of December 31, 2021. Of the AFS debt securities with gross unrealized losses, substantially all were rated investment grade as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021. There was no allowance for credit losses provided against the AFS debt securities as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021. Additionally, there were no credit losses recognized in earnings for both 2022 and 2021. 
 
 Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities 
 
 During the first quarter of 2022, the Company transferred 3.01 billion in aggregate fair value of U.S. Treasury, government agency and government-sponsored enterprise debt and mortgage-backed securities, and municipal securities from AFS to HTM. In comparison, there were no HTM debt securities as of December 31, 2021. The Company s HTM debt securities are carried at amortized cost. The unrealized gains or losses at the date of transfer of these securities continue to be reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) AOCI ), net of tax on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are amortized over the remaining life of the securities. 
 
 All HTM debt securities were issued, guaranteed, or supported by the U.S. government or government-sponsored enterprises. Accordingly, the Company applied a zero credit loss assumption for these securities and no allowance for credit loss was recorded as of December 31, 2022. For additional discussion on the allowance for credit losses, see Note 4 Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

 Because 71 and 75 of total CRE loans were concentrated in California as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, changes in California s economy and real estate values could have a significant impact on the collectability of these loans and the required level of allowance for loan losses.

 Consumer Single-Family Residential Loans. Single-family residential loans totaled 11.22 billion or 23 of total loans held-for-investment as of December 31, 2022, compared with 9.09 billion or 22 of total loans held-for-investment as of December 31, 2021. Year-over-year, single-family residential loans increased 2.13 billion or 23 , primarily driven by growth in mortgages on residential properties in California and New York. The Company was in a first lien position for all of its single-family residential loans as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021. Many of these loans are reduced documentation loans, for which a substantial down payment is required, resulting in a low LTV ratio at origination, typically 65 or less. The weighted-average LTV ratio was 53 and 52 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These loans have historically experienced low delinquency and loss rates. The Company offers a variety of single-family residential first lien mortgage loan programs, including fixed- and variable-rate loans, as well as hybrid loans with interest rates that adjust on a regular basis, typically annually, after an initial fixed rate period.

The increase in the Company s stockholders equity was primarily due to 2022 net income of 1.13 billion, partially offset by a negative change in AOCI of 675.2 million, cash dividends declared of 229.2 million, and common stock repurchases of 100.0 million. The negative change in AOCI was primarily due to increased unrealized losses in AFS debt securities. For other factors that contributed to the changes in stockholders equity, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity in this Form 10-K. 
 
 Book value was 42.46 per common share as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 3 from 41.13 per common share as of December 31, 2021, primarily due to the factors described above. Tangible equity per common share was 39.10 as of December 31, 2022, compared with 37.79 as of December 31, 2021. For additional details, see the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures presented under Item 7. MD A Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Form 10-K.

The dividend was paid on February 21, 2023, to stockholders of record as of February 6, 2023. 

Deposits and Other Sources of Funding 
 
 Deposits are the Company s primary source of funding, the cost of which has a significant impact on the Company s net interest income and net interest margin. Additional funding may be provided by short- and long-term borrowings, and long-term debt. See Item 7. MD A Risk Management Liquidity Risk Management Liquidity in this Form 10-K for a discussion of the Company s liquidity management. The following table summarizes the Company s sources of funds as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: 
 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Change in thousands) Amount Amount Deposits: Noninterest-bearing demand 21,051,090 38 22,845,464 43 (1,794,374) (8) Interest-bearing checking 6,672,165 12 6,524,721 12 147,444 2 Money market 12,265,024 22 13,130,300 25 (865,276) (7) Savings 2,649,037 4 2,888,065 5 (239,028) (8) Time deposits 13,330,533 24 7,961,982 15 5,368,551 67 Total deposits 55,967,849 100 53,350,532 100 2,617,317 5 Other Funds: FHLB advances 249,331 36 (249,331) (100) Repurchase agreements 300,000 67 300,000 43 Long-term debt 147,950 33 147,658 21 292 0 Total other funds 447,950 100 696,989 100 (249,039) (36) Total sources of funds 56,415,799 54,047,521 2,368,278 4 
 
 Deposits 
 
 The Company offers a wide variety of deposit products to consumer and commercial customers. To provide a stable and low-cost source of funding and liquidity, the Company s strategy is to grow and retain relationship-based deposits. Total deposits reached 55.97 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 2.62 billion or 5 from 53.35 billion as of December 31, 2021. Deposit growth was driven by time deposits, which increased 5.37 billion or 67 year-over-year, partially offset by decreases in noninterest-bearing demand and money market deposits. The balance shift to time deposits was largely driven by continued increases in benchmark interest rates and a successful branch-based CD campaign. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits comprised 38 and 43 of total deposits as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in noninterest-bearing demand deposits reflects customer utilization of excess balances and a shift to interest-earning options, in response to higher interest rates. Additional information regarding the impact of deposits on net interest income, with a comparison of average deposit balances and rates, is provided in Item 7 MD A Results of Operations Net Interest Income in this Form 10-K. 
 55 

As of December 31, 2022, customer deposits of 52.92 billion, 1.47 billion, and 1.58 billion were held in the Company s domestic offices, the subsidiary bank in China and the branch in Hong Kong, respectively. D epositors domiciled in non-U.S. countries and territories made up 11.79 billion or 22 of the deposits held in domestic offices as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, 6.26 billion or 30 of total noninterest-bearing demand deposits as of December 31, 2022, were from depositors domiciled in non-U.S. countries and territories. 
 
 Customer deposit accounts in the domestic offices are insured by the FDIC for up to 250,000. The deposits in the Company s subsidiary bank in China and the branch in Hong Kong are insured by each jurisdiction s deposit insurance authority for up to 500,000 RMB and 500,000 HKD, respectively. The amounts disclosed below are derived using the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting requirements. The following table presents total uninsured deposits by location as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:

Other Sources of Funding 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, all previously outstanding FHLB advances had matured, compared with 249.3 million of FHLB advances outstanding as of December 31, 2021. 
 
 Gross repurchase agreements were 300.0 million as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021. As of December 31, 2022, the interest rates ranged from 6.63 to 6.95 . Repurchase agreements of 200.0 million have an original maturity of 10.0 years, whereas repurchase agreements of 100.0 million have an original maturity of 8.5 years. All repurchase agreements will mature in 2023. 
 
 Repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and recorded as liabilities based on the values at which the assets are sold. To ensure the market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient, the Company monitors the fair value of collateral pledged relative to the principal amounts borrowed under the repurchase agreements. The Company manages liquidity risks related to the repurchase agreements by sourcing funds from a diverse group of counterparties, and entering into repurchase agreements with longer durations, when appropriate. For additional details, see Note 3 Assets Purchased under Resale Agreements and Sold under Repurchase Agreements to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 
 
 The Company uses long-term debt to provide funding to acquire interest-earning assets, and to enhance liquidity and regulatory capital adequacy. Long-term debt totaled 148.0 million and 147.7 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining maturities ranged between 11.9 years and 14.7 years. Long-term debt consists of junior subordinated debt, which qualifies as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes. For additional details, see Note 10 Federal Home Loan Bank Advances and Long-Term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 
 
 56 

Regulatory Capital and Ratios 
 
 The federal banking agencies have risk-based capital adequacy requirements intended to ensure that banking organizations maintain capital that is commensurate with the degree of risk associated with their operations. The Company and the Bank are each subject to these regulatory capital adequacy requirements. See Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation Regulatory Capital Requirements and Regulatory Capital-Related Development in this Form 10-K for additional details. 
 
 The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, which requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on management s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Company s relevant financial assets. The Company has elected the phase-in option provided by a final rule that delays an estimate of the CECL effect on regulatory capital for two years and phases in the impact over three years. The rule permits certain banking organizations to exclude from regulatory capital the initial adoption impact of CECL, plus 25 of the cumulative changes in the allowance for credit losses under CECL for each period until December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year phase-out period in which the aggregate benefit is reduced by 25 in 2022, 50 in 2023 and 75 in 2024. Accordingly, our capital ratios as of December 31, 2022 reflect a delay of 75 of the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital. 
 
 The following table presents the Company s and the Bank s capital ratios as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 under the Basel III Capital Rules, and those required by regulatory agencies for capital adequacy and well-capitalized classification purposes: 
 Basel III Capital Rules December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Company East West Bank Company East West Bank Minimum Regulatory Requirements Minimum Regulatory Requirements including Capital Conservation Buffer Well- Capitalized Requirements Risk-based capital ratios: CET 1 capital 12.7 12.5 12.8 12.3 4.5 7.0 6.5 Tier 1 capital (1)

 9.8 9.7 9.0 8.6 4.0 4.0 5.0 
 (1) The Tier 1 leverage well-capitalized requirement applies only to the Bank since there is no Tier 1 leverage ratio component in the definition of a well-capitalized bank holding company. The minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio requirement for the Company to be considered well-capitalized is 6 . 
 
 The Company is committed to maintaining strong capital levels to assure the Company s investors, customers and regulators that the Company and the Bank are financially sound. As of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company and the Bank continued to exceed all well-capitalized capital requirements and the required minimum capital requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules. Total risk-weighted assets were 50.04 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 6.45 billion or 15 from 43.59 billion as of December 31, 2021. The increase in risk-weighted assets was primarily due to loan growth. 

Risk Management 
 
 Overview 
 
 In the normal course of conducting its business, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent to the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to the Company s business. The Company operates under a Board-approved ERM framework, which outlines the company-wide approach to risk management and oversight, and describes the structures and practices employed to manage the current and emerging risks inherent to the Company. The Company s ERM program incorporates risk management throughout the organization in identifying, managing, monitoring and reporting risks. It identifies the Company s major risk categories as: credit, liquidity, capital, market, operational, compliance, legal, strategic and reputational. 
 
 57 

The Risk Oversight Committee of the Board of Directors monitors the ERM program through established risk categories and provides oversight of the Company s risk appetite and control environment. The Risk Oversight Committee provides focused oversight of the Company s identified enterprise risk categories on behalf of the full Board of Directors. Under the direction of the Risk Oversight Committee, management committees apply targeted strategies to reduce the risks to which the Company s operations are exposed. 
 
 The Company s ERM program is executed along the three lines of defense model, which provides for a consistent and standardized risk management control environment across the enterprise. The first line of defense is comprised of production, operational, and support units. The second line of defense is comprised of various risk management and control functions charged with monitoring and managing specific major risk categories and/or risk subcategories. The third line of defense is comprised of the Internal Audit function and Independent Asset Review IAR ). Internal Audit and IAR provide assurance and evaluate the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes as established by the Company. Reporting directly to the Board s Audit Committee, Internal Audit maintains organizational independence and objectivity. Further discussion and analysis of the primary risk areas are detailed in the following subsections of Risk Management. 

Credit Risk Management 
 
 Credit risk is the risk that a borrower or a counterparty will fail to perform according to the terms and conditions of a loan or investment and expose the Company to loss. Credit risk exists with many of the Company s assets and exposures such as loans, debt securities and certain derivatives. The majority of the Company s credit risk is associated with lending activities. 
 
 The Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility for identified enterprise risk categories including credit risk. The Risk Oversight Committee monitors management s assessment of asset quality, credit risk trends, credit quality administration, underwriting standards, and portfolio credit risk management strategies and processes, such as diversification and concentration limits, all of which enable management to control credit risk. At the management level, the Credit Risk Management Committee has primary oversight responsibility for credit risk. The Senior Credit Supervision function manages credit policy for the line of business transactional credit risk, assuring that all exposure is risk-rated according to the requirements of the credit risk rating policy. The Senior Credit Supervision function evaluates and reports the overall credit risk exposure to senior management and the Risk Oversight Committee. Reporting directly to the Board s Risk Oversight Committee, the IAR function provides additional support to the Company s strong credit risk management culture by providing an independent and objective assessment of underwriting and documentation quality. A key focus of our credit risk management is adherence to a well-controlled underwriting process. 
 
 The Company assesses the overall credit quality performance of the loans held-for-investment portfolio through an integrated analysis of specific performance ratios. This approach forms the basis of the discussion in the sections immediately following: Nonperforming Assets, Troubled Debt Restructurings TDRs and Allowance for Credit Losses. 

Credit Quality 
 
 The Company utilizes a credit risk rating system to assist in monitoring credit quality. Loans are evaluated using the Company s internal credit risk rating of 1 through 10. For more information on the Company s credit quality indicators and internal credit risk ratings, refer to Note 6 Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

Nonperforming Assets 
 
 Nonperforming assets are comprised of nonaccrual loans, other real estate owned OREO ), and other nonperforming assets. Other nonperforming assets and OREO are repossessed assets and properties, respectively, acquired through foreclosure, or through full or partial satisfaction of loans held-for-investment. Nonperforming assets were 99.8 million or 0.16 of total assets as of December 31, 2022, a decrease of 3.7 million or 4 , compared with 103.5 million or 0.17 of total assets as of December 31, 2021.

 Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due or when the full collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain regardless of the length of past due status. Collectability is generally assessed based on economic and business conditions, the borrower s financial condition and the adequacy of collateral, if any. For additional details regarding the Company s nonaccrual loan policy, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Significant Accounting Policies Loans Held-for-Investment to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 
 
 Nonaccrual loans were 99.5 million as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 6.3 million or 7 from 93.2 million as of December 31, 2021. This increase was predominantly due to an increase in CRE nonaccrual loans, partially offset by charge-offs and paydowns of commercial loans. As of December 31, 2022, 68.3 million or 69 of nonaccrual loans were less than 90 days delinquent. In comparison, 54.2 million or 58 of nonaccrual loans were less than 90 days delinquent as of December 31, 2021.

 Troubled Debt Restructurings 
 
 TDRs are loans for which contractual terms have been modified by the Company for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties, and for which a concession to the borrower was granted that the Company would not otherwise consider. The Company s loan modifications are handled on a case-by-case basis and are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan collectability and meet the borrower s financial needs. A modification typically may include rate reduction, principal forgiveness, extension of loan terms, and delay of payment, and is intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. At the time of restructuring, if a portion of the loan is deemed to be uncollectible, a charge-off may be recorded. Alternatively, if a charge-off has already been recorded in a previous period then no charge-off is required at the time of modification. 
 
 The following table presents the performing and nonperforming TDRs by loan portfolio segments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The allowance for loan losses for total TDRs was 17.7 million as of December 31, 2022, and 4.8 million as of December 31, 2021.

Performing TDRs were 75.9 million as of December 31, 2022, a decrease of 37.9 million or 33 from 113.8 million as of December 31, 2021. This decrease reflected payoffs and paydowns of performing C I, single-family residential and multifamily residential TDR loans, partially offset by one newly designated performing C I TDR loan. Over 93 and 94 of the performing TDR loans were current as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 Nonperforming TDRs were 43.8 million as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 13.4 million or 44 from 30.4 million as of December 31, 2021. This increase primarily reflected newly designated nonperforming C I TDR loans, partially offset by payoffs and paydowns of nonperforming C I TDR loans. 
 
 Existing TDRs that were subsequently modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be classified as TDRs. Customers who require further assistance upon exiting from the COVID-19 deferral programs may receive further modifications which may be classified as TDRs. As of December 31, 2022, there were no TDRs that were modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the amount of TDRs that were modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic were insignificant as of December 31, 2021. 
 
 Loan Modifications Due to COVID-19 Pandemic 
 
 The Company granted a range of commercial and consumer loan accommodations to borrowers experiencing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 related loan modifications, which occurred between March 1, 2020 through January 1, 2022, that met the loan modification criteria under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act or under the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised), were generally not categorized as TDRs during the relief period which expired on January 1, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no loans under payment deferral and forbearance programs, compared with 363.1 million of loans under payment deferral and forbearance programs as of December 31, 2021. Loans that exited the modification program were substantially all current as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 The allowance for credit losses represents management s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Company s relevant financial assets. The allowance for credit losses estimate uses various models and estimation techniques based on historical loss experience, current borrower characteristics, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and other relevant factors. 
 
 In addition to the allowance for loan losses, the Company maintains an allowance for unfunded credit commitments. The Company has three general areas for which it provides the allowance for unfunded credit commitments: (1) recourse obligations for loans sold, (2) letters of credit, and (3) unfunded lending commitments. The Company s methodology for determining the allowance calculation for unfunded lending commitments uses the lifetime loss rates of the on-balance sheet commitment. Recourse obligations for loans sold and letters of credit use the weighted loss rates for the applicable segment of the individual credit. 
 
 For loans and securities, allowance for credit losses are contra-asset valuation accounts that are deducted from the amortized cost basis of these assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. For unfunded credit commitments, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account that is reported as a component of Accrued expenses and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
 The Company is committed to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at a level that is commensurate with the estimated inherent losses in the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit facilities. While the Company believes that the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2022 was appropriate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio and in unfunded credit commitments based on the information available, future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to, accounting standard and regulatory changes, loan growth, portfolio performance and general economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires numerous estimates and judgements. For a description of the policies, methodologies and judgments used to determine the allowance for credit losses, see Item 7. MD A Critical Accounting Estimates, Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6 Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

Liquidity Risk Management 

Liquidity 
 
 Liquidity is a financial institution s capacity to meet its deposit and obligations to other counterparties as they come due, or to obtain adequate funding at a reasonable cost to meet those obligations. The objective of liquidity management is to manage the potential mismatch of asset and liability cash flows. Maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on the institution s ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash flows, and collateral needs without adversely affecting daily operations or the financial condition of the institution. To achieve this objective, the Company analyzes its liquidity risk, maintains readily available liquid assets and utilizes diverse funding sources including its stable core deposit base. 
 
 The Board of Directors Risk Oversight Committee has primary oversight responsibility over liquidity risk management. At the management level, the Company s Asset/Liability Committee ALCO establishes the liquidity guidelines that govern the day-to-day active management of the Company s liquidity position by requiring sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines are established and monitored for both the Bank and East West, on a stand-alone basis to ensure that the Company can serve as a source of strength for its subsidiaries. The ALCO regularly monitors the Company s liquidity status and related management processes, providing regular reports to the Board of Directors. The Company s liquidity management practices have been effective under normal operating and stressed market conditions. 
 
 63 

Liquidity Risk Liquidity Sources. The Company s primary source of funding is from deposits, generated by its banking business, which we believe is a relatively stable and low-cost source of funding. A substantial portion of our loans were funded by our deposits, which amounted to 55.97 billion and 53.35 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company s loan-to-deposit ratio was 86 as of December 31, 2022, compared with 78 as of December 31, 2021. 
 
 In addition to deposits, the Company has access to various sources of wholesale financing, including borrowing capacity with the FHLB and FRBSF, unsecured federal funds lines of credit with various correspondent banks, and several master repurchase agreements with major brokerage companies to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands and allow management flexibility to execute its business strategy. Economic conditions and the stability of capital markets impact the Company s access to and the cost of wholesale financing. The Company s access to capital markets is also affected by the ratings received from various credit rating agencies. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had available borrowing capacity of 22.90 billion. The available borrowing capacity included secured borrowing lines of 12.77 billion with the FHLB and 2.05 billion with the FRBSF, unsecured federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks of 1.14 billion, and borrowing capacity from unpledged debt securities of 6.94 billion. Unencumbered loans and/or debt securities were pledged to the FHLB and the FRBSF discount window as collateral. The Company has established operational procedures to enable borrowing against these assets, including regular monitoring of the total pool of loans and debt securities eligible as collateral. Eligibility of collateral is defined in guidelines from the FHLB and FRBSF and is subject to change at their discretion. See Item 7. MD A Balance Sheet Analysis Deposits and Other Sources of Funding in this Form 10-K for further detail related to the Company s funding sources. The Company believes its available borrowing capacity and liquid asset pool described below provide sufficient liquidity above its expected cash needs. 
 
 The Company maintains a certain level of liquid assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing deposits with banks, short-term resale agreements, and unencumbered high-quality and liquid AFS debt securities. The following table presents the Company s liquid assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: 
 in thousands) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Cash and cash equivalents 3,481,784 3,912,935 Interest-bearing deposits with banks 139,021 736,492 Resale agreements due to mature in one year 307,192 1,818,503 AFS debt securities: U.S. Treasury, and U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise debt securities 1,067,810 2,334,652 U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities 2,262,464 4,157,263 Foreign government bonds 227,053 257,733 Municipal securities 257,099 523,158 Non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and CLOs 1,694,293 2,042,882 Corporate debt securities 526,274 649,665 Less: pledged securities (531,233) (803,896) Total 9,431,757 15,629,387 
 
 Unencumbered liquid assets totaled 9.43 billion as of December 31, 2022, compared with 15.63 billion as of December 31, 2021. The decrease in liquid assets was primarily related to the transfer of 3.01 billion of debt securities from the AFS portfolio to the HTM portfolio during the first quarter of 2022, a decrease in the fair value of AFS debt securities primarily due to interest rate increases and net cash usage due to higher net growth in loans than deposits. 
 
 AFS debt securities, included as part of liquidity sources, consist of high quality and liquid securities with moderate durations to minimize overall interest rate and liquidity risks. The Company believes these AFS debt securities provide quick sources of liquidity to obtain financing, regardless of market conditions, through sale or pledging. We also hold additional debt securities within our HTM portfolio, which are not intended for sale but may be pledged to obtain additional liquidity. In addition, the Company may use debt and equity issuances when costs are deemed attractive, should longer term needs arise. 
 
 64 

Liquidity Risk Cash Requirements. In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters contractual obligations that require future cash payments, including funding for customer deposit withdrawals, repayments for short- and long-term borrowings and other cash commitments. For additional information on these obligations, see the following Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K: 
 
 Note 3 Assets Purchased under Resale Agreements and Sold under Repurchase Agreements 
 Note 7 Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Partnerships, Tax Credit and Other Investments, Net and Variable Interest Entities 
 Note 9 Deposits 
 Note 10 Federal Home Loan Bank Advances and Long-Term Debt 
 
 The Company also has off-balance sheet arrangements, which represent transactions that are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company s off-balance sheet arrangements include (1) commitments to extend credit, such as loan commitments, commercial letters of credit for foreign and domestic trade, standby letters of credit SBLCs ), and financial guarantees, to meet the financing needs of its customers, (2) future interest obligations related to customer deposits and the Company s borrowings, and (3) transactions with unconsolidated entities that provide financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the Company, or engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with the Company. Because many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future funding requirements. Information about the Company s loan commitments, commercial letters of credit and SBLCs is provided in Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 
 
 The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows summarizes the Company s sources and uses of cash by type of activities in 2022, 2021 and 2020. Excess cash generated by operating and investing activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets. 
 
 Liquidity Risk Liquidity for East West. In addition to bank level liquidity management, the Company manages liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including payment of dividends, repurchases of common stock, principal and interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions, and additional investments in its subsidiaries. East West s primary source of liquidity is from cash dividends distributed by its subsidiary, East West Bank. The Bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends as discussed in Item 1 . Business Supervision and Regulation Dividends and Other Transfers of Funds in this Form 10-K. East West held 228.5 million and 345.0 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Management believes that East West has sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet the projected cash obligations for the coming year. 
 
 Liquidity Risk Liquidity Stress Testing. The Company utilizes liquidity stress analysis to determine the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the Company, foreign subsidiary and foreign branch to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. Scenario analyses include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources, market triggers, potential uses of funding and economic conditions in certain countries. In addition, Company specific events are incorporated into the stress testing. Liquidity stress tests are conducted to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons, both immediate and longer term, and over a variety of stressed conditions. Given the range of potential stresses, the Company maintains contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities. 
 
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company believes it has adequate liquidity resources to conduct operations and meet other needs in the ordinary course of business, and is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources or operations. Given the uncertain and rapidly changing market and economic conditions, the Company will continue to actively evaluate the impact on its business and financial position. For more information on how economic conditions may impact our liquidity, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Form 10-K. 

Market Risk Management 
 
 Market risk refers to the risk of potential loss due to adverse movements in market risk factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and credit spreads. The Company is primarily exposed to interest rate risk through its core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. The Risk Oversight Committee of the Company s Board of Directors has primary oversight responsibility and has given the ALCO the task of market risk management. The ALCO establishes guidelines, risk measures and limits, and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market risk management activities. 
 
 65 

Interest Rate Risk Management 
 
 Interest rate risk results primarily from the Company s traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans, which are the primary areas of market risk for the Company. Interest rate risk is comprised of repricing risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and options risk. Repricing risk arises from differences in the cash flow or repricing between asset and liability portfolios. Basis risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different market rate indices, which do not always change by the same amount. Yield curve risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different maturities on a given yield curve; when the yield curve changes shape, the risk position is altered. Options risk arises from embedded options within asset and liability products. For example, loan prepayments and early withdrawals of certificates of deposits could increase or decrease in response to interest rate fluctuation. 
 
 The ALCO coordinates the overall management of the Company s interest rate risk, meets regularly to review the Company s open market positions and establishes policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk. Interest rate risk management is carried out primarily through strategies involving the Company s debt securities portfolio, loan portfolio, available funding channels and capital market activities. In addition, the Company s policies permit the use of derivative instruments to assist in managing interest rate risk. 
 
 The interest rate risk exposure is measured and monitored through various risk management tools, which include a simulation model that performs interest rate sensitivity analyses under multiple interest rate scenarios against a baseline. The simulation model incorporates the market s forward rate expectations and the Company s earning assets and liabilities. The Company uses both a static balance sheet and a forward growth balance sheet to perform the interest rate sensitivity analyses. The simulated interest rate scenarios include an instantaneous non-parallel shift in the yield curve and a gradual non-parallel shift in the yield curve rate ramp over a static balance sheet. In addition, the Company also performs simulations using other alternative interest rate scenarios, including various permutations of the yield curve flattening, steepening or inverting. Results of these various simulations are used to formulate and gauge strategies to achieve a desired risk profile within the Company s capital and liquidity guidelines. 
 
 The net interest income simulation model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of the Company s interest rate sensitive assets, liabilities and related derivative contracts. It also incorporates various assumptions, which management believes to be reasonable but may have a significant impact on the results. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates, the yield curve evolution and shape, the correlation between various interest rate indices, financial instruments future repricing characteristics and spread relative to benchmark rates, and the effect of interest rate floors and caps. The modeled results are highly sensitive to deposit decay and deposit beta assumptions, which are derived from a regression analysis of the Company s historical deposit data. Deposit beta commonly refers to the correlation of the changes in interest rates paid on deposits to changes in the benchmark interest rates. The Company used full-through-the-cycle betas with each incremental rate increase in the rate ramp scenarios, and did not assume lags in repricing. The model is also sensitive to the loan and investment prepayment assumptions that are based on an independent model and the Company s historical prepayment data, which consider anticipated prepayments under different interest rate environments. 
 
 Simulation results are highly dependent on input assumptions. To the extent the actual behavior is different from the assumptions used in the models, there could be material changes in interest rate sensitivity results. The assumptions applied in the model are documented, supported, and periodically back-tested to assess the reasonableness and effectiveness. The Company also regularly monitors the sensitivity of the other important modeling assumptions, such as loan and security prepayments and early withdrawal on fixed-rate customer liabilities. The Company makes appropriate calibrations to the model as needed and continually validates the model, methodology and results. Changes to key model assumptions are reviewed by the ALCO. Scenario results do not reflect strategies that the management could employ to limit the impact of changing interest rate expectations. The simulation does not represent a forecast of the Company s net interest income but is a tool utilized to assess the risk of the impact of changing market interest rate across a range of interest rate environments. 
 
 In March 2022, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the fed funds rate to 0.25 to 0.50 to address concerns about inflation, which reflected supply and demand imbalances due to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. The Federal Reserve continued its aggressive approach in responding to inflation throughout 2022 by incrementally raising the target range for the fed funds rate, which by year-end had increased to a range of 4.25 to 4.50 , and which was subsequently increased to a range of 4.50 to 4.75 in February 2023. The market estimates that interest rates are likely to continue rising, potentially reaching 5.00 or higher by March 2023. However, increased uncertainty regarding a potential recession has also led to the expectation of rate cuts potentially occurring by the end of 2023.

Twelve-Month Net Interest Income Simulation 
 
 Net interest income simulation modeling measures interest rate risk through earnings volatility. The simulation projects the cash flow changes in interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities, expressed in terms of net interest income, over a specified time horizon for defined interest rate scenarios. Net interest income simulations provide insight into the impact of market rate changes on earnings, which help guide risk management decisions. The Company assesses interest rate risk by comparing the changes of net interest income in different interest rate scenarios. 
 
 The following table presents the Company s net interest income sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates by 100 and 200 bps as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 based on a static balance sheet as of the date of the analysis. 
 Change in Interest Rates (in bps) Net Interest Income Volatility (1) 
 December 31, 2022 2021 +200 11.6 19.5 +100 5.9 9.4 -100 (5.3) NM -200 (8.6) NM 
 NM Not meaningful. 
 (1) The percentage change represents net interest income change over a 12-month period in a stable interest rate environment versus in the various interest rate scenarios. 
 
 The composition of the Company s loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movement due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floating-rate loan portfolio versus deposit products. In the table above, net interest income volatility is expressed in relation to base-case net interest income, which decreased year-over year as a result of interest rate hedging activities, changes in the funding mix, decreases in cash and cash equivalents, resale agreements, short-term investments, and growth in fixed-rate loans. 
 
 While an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates was used in the simulation model described in the preceding paragraph, the Company also models scenarios based on gradual shifts in interest rates and assesses the corresponding impacts. These interest rate scenarios provide additional information to estimate the Company s underlying interest rate risk. The rate ramp table below shows the net interest income volatility under a gradual non-parallel shift of the yield curve, in even monthly increments over the first 12 months, followed by rates held constant thereafter based on a static balance sheet as of the date of the analysis. Actual results will vary based on the timing and pace of interest rate changes, as well as changes in the balance sheet. 
 Change in Interest Rates (in bps) Net Interest Income Volatility December 31, 2022 2021 +200 Rate ramp 6.3 9.2 +100 Rate ramp 3.4 4.1 -100 Rate ramp (2.4) NM -200 Rate ramp (4.9) NM 
 NM Not meaningful. 
 
 67 

As of December 31, 2022, the Company s net interest income profile reflects an asset sensitive position. Net interest income is expected to increase when interest rates rise as the Company has a large share of variable rate loans, primarily linked to Prime, LIBOR, and Term SOFR indices. The Company s interest income is sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. The Company added 3.25 billion of interest rate hedges during 2022, which reduced the net interest income volatility by approximately 1 of the base net interest income for every 100 bps change in interest rates. The Company s deposit portfolio is primarily composed of non-maturity deposits, which are not directly tied to short-term interest rate indices, but are, nevertheless, sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. The modeled results are highly sensitive to reinvestment yield and deposit beta assumptions. Actual results in terms of net interest income growth during a period of rising interest rates will also reflect earning asset growth and deposit mix changes based on customer preferences relative to the interest rate environment. During a period of declining interest rates, balance sheet growth could offset headwinds to net interest income from yield compression. 
 
 Economic Value of Equity at Risk 
 
 Economic value of equity EVE is a cash flow calculation that takes the present value of all asset cash flows and subtracts the present value of all liability cash flows. This calculation is used for asset/liability management and measures changes in the economic value of the bank. The economic value approach provides a comparatively broader scope than the net interest income volatility approach since it captures all anticipated cash flows. 
 
 The EVE simulation reflects the sensitivity of the EVE to interest rate changes across the full maturity spectrum of the Company s assets and liabilities. It identifies risks arising from repricing, prepayment and maturity gaps between assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, as well as from off-balance sheet derivative exposure. The simulation provides long-term economic perspective into the Company s interest rate risk profile, which allows the Company to manage anticipated negative effects of interest rate fluctuations. 
 
 The following table presents the Company s EVE sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained non-parallel shift in market interest rates by 100 and 200 bps as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:

 (1) The percentage change represents net portfolio value change of the Company in a stable interest rate environment versus in the various interest rate scenarios. 
 
 The Company s EVE sensitivity for the upward interest rate scenarios shifted from a positive to a negative change as of December 31, 2022, compared with the results as of December 31, 2021. The change in EVE sensitivity was primarily due to updates to non-maturity deposit behavior, which were assumed to run-off faster in the higher interest rate environment, as well as interest rate hedging activities that were executed during the year. 
 
 The Company s EVE profile as of December 31, 2022, reflects a liability sensitive EVE position. Since the EVE profile represents the discounted present value of cash flows over the expected life of the instruments, the change in EVE does not reflect the degree of earnings that would be impacted over a short time horizon. Additionally, EVE does not account for factors such as balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, product spreads, and yield curve relationships that could reduce or increase the impact of changes in interest rates. Given the uncertainty of the magnitude, timing and direction of future interest rate movements, and the shape of the yield curve, actual results may vary from those predicted by the Company s model.

Derivatives 
 
 It is the Company s policy not to speculate on the future direction of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. However, the Company periodically enters into derivative transactions in order to manage its exposure to market risk, primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The Company believes these derivative transactions, when properly structured and managed, provides a hedge against inherent risk in certain assets and liabilities or against risk in specific transactions. Hedging transactions may be implemented using a variety of derivative instruments such as swaps, forwards, options and collars. The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in interest payments received on certain floating-rate commercial loans and interest payments paid on certain floating-rate borrowings. Foreign exchange derivatives are used in net investment hedging strategies to mitigate the risk of changes in the USD equivalent value of a designated monetary amount of the Company s net investment in East West Bank (China) Limited. Prior to entering into any accounting hedge activities, the Company analyzes the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to alternative strategies. The Company also repositions its hedging derivatives portfolio based on the current assessment of economic and financial conditions, including the interest rate and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and trends, and the relative mix of its cash and derivative positions. 
 
 In addition, the Company enters into derivative transactions in order to accommodate its customers with their business needs or to assist customers with their risk management objectives, such as managing exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodity prices. To economically hedge against the derivative contracts entered into with the Company s customers, the Company enters into offsetting derivative contracts with third-party financial institutions, some of which are cleared through central clearing organizations. The exposures from derivative transactions are collateralized by cash and/or eligible securities based on limits as set forth in the respective agreements between the Company and counterparty financial institutions. The changes in fair values of the derivative contracts traded with third-party financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the derivative transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts, except for the credit valuation adjustment component in the contracts and the spread variances between the customer derivatives and the offsetting financial counterparty positions. The Company also utilizes foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the economic effect of fluctuations in certain foreign currency on-balance sheet assets and liabilities, primarily foreign currency denominated deposits offered to its customers. 
 
 The Company is subject to credit risk associated with the counterparties to the derivative contracts. This counterparty credit risk is a multi-dimensional form of risk, affected by both the exposure and credit quality of the counterparty, both of which are sensitive to market-induced changes. The Company s Credit Risk Management Committee provides oversight of credit risk and the Company has guidelines in place to manage counterparty concentration, tenor limits and collateral. The Company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties, by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements and by requiring collateral arrangements, where possible. The Company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to institutional third parties through the use of credit risk participation agreements. Certain derivative contracts are required to be cleared through central clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk, where variation margin is applied daily as settlement to the fair value of the derivative contracts. Additionally, the Company incorporates credit value adjustments and other market standard methodologies to appropriately reflect the counterparty s and its own nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement of its derivatives. As of December 31, 2022, the Company anticipates performance by its counterparties and has not incurred any related credit losses.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Certain of these policies include critical accounting estimates, which are subject to valuation assumptions, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and it is likely that materially different amounts could be reported under different assumptions and conditions. The Company has procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. The following is a brief description of the Company s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments. 
 
 Allowance for Loan Losses and Unfunded Credit Commitments 
 
 The Company s allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Company s financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loans and certain lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters including development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of historical loss experience, assessment of key credit risk characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination of remaining expected life. For additional information on these judgements and the Company s policies and methodologies used to determine the allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Significant Accounting Policies Allowance for Loan Losses and Unfunded Credit Commitments, and Note 6 Loans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 
 
 70 

A critical judgement in the process is estimating the Company s allowance for credit losses related to macroeconomic forecasts that are incorporated into quantitative methods. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the Company utilizes a baseline and upside or downside scenarios which are applied based on a probability weighting, to better reflect management s expectation of expected credit losses given existing market conditions and the changes in the economic environment. Changes in the Company s assumptions and economic forecasts could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses, which could potentially lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next. For further discussion on the economic forecast incorporated into the 2022 model, see Item 7. MD A Risk Management Credit Risk Management Allowance for Credit Losses. 
 
 The allowance for credit losses is sensitive to changes in macroeconomic forecast assumptions. Given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables within the Company s models, it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one factor or input on the allowance. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and input may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others. However, to provide additional context regarding the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses to changes in key variables, the Company compared the quantitative modeled estimate when applying a 100 probability weighting to the downside scenario rather than the weighting of multiple scenarios used to estimate the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2022. Without considering model overlays and qualitative adjustments which could result in a materially different estimate, this sensitivity analysis would have been approximately 292.9 million higher. 
 
 This analysis demonstrates the sensitivity to the allowance for credit losses to key quantitative assumptions and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as it does not capture all the potential unknown variables that could arise in the forecast period, but it provides an approximation of a possible outcome under hypothetical severe conditions. Management believes that the estimate for the allowance for credit losses was reasonable and appropriate as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 Fair Value Estimates 
 
 Certain financial instruments are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a recurring basis, including AFS debt securities, certain equity securities and derivatives. Changes in fair value are recorded either through earnings or other comprehensive income (loss). Other financial instruments, such as certain individually evaluated loans held-for-investment, loans held-for-sale, investments in qualified affordable housing partnerships, tax credit and other investments, OREO and other nonperforming assets, are not carried at fair value each period but may require nonrecurring fair value adjustments primarily due to application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or write-downs of individual assets. 
 
 In determining the fair value of financial instruments, the Company uses market prices of the same or similar instruments whenever such prices are available. The Company does not use prices involving distressed sellers in determining fair value. Changes in the market conditions such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may increase variability or reduce the availability of market prices used to determine fair value. If observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain, then fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flows analysis. These modeling techniques incorporate management s assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability, including the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique and the risk of nonperformance. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Company could result in different estimates of fair value of financial instruments. 
 
 Significant judgment is also required to determine the fair value hierarchy for certain financial instruments. When fair values are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement, the financial assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy established under ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement .

 Goodwill Impairment 
 
 The valuation and testing methodologies used in the Company s analysis of goodwill impairment are discussed in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill, Note 8 Goodwill, and Note 17 Business Segments to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K . 
 
 The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test on all three reporting units using a combination of income and market approaches to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit. The Company concluded that the goodwill allocated to its reporting units was not impaired as of December 31, 2022. The fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by a substantial amount and there was no indication of a significant risk of goodwill impairment based on current projections. 
 
 Analyzing goodwill includes consideration of various factors that continue to evolve and for which significant uncertainty remains, including estimates of the profitability of the Company s reporting units, long term growth rates and the estimated market cost of equity, such as the discount rate and price multiples of comparable companies. Imprecision in estimating these factors can affect the estimated fair value of the reporting units. Certain events or circumstances could have a negative effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting units, including declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions and adverse regulatory or legislative changes, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The Company files income tax returns in the jurisdictions in which it conducts business and evaluates income tax expense in two components: current and deferred income tax expense. Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or due from various tax jurisdictions in the current year and deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. The Company s interpretations of the tax laws, including the U.S., its states and the municipalities, and the tax jurisdictions in Hong Kong and China, are complex and subject to audit by taxing authorities that disputes may occur regarding its view on a tax position taken by the Company. 
 
 72 

In estimating accrued taxes, the Company assesses the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other pertinent information. The income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the Company and the relevant government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining the tax accruals and in evaluating the tax positions, including evaluating uncertain tax positions. Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, tax credits, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations by the tax authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits and risks of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, impact tax expense and can materially affect our operating results and financial condition. The Company reviews its tax positions on a quarterly basis and makes adjustments to accrued taxes as new information becomes available. The Company believes that adequate provisions have been recorded for all income tax uncertainties consistent with ASC 740, Income Taxes as of December 31, 2022 . For further information on the Company s accounting for income taxes and significant tax attributes, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Significant Accounting Policies Income Taxes and Note 11 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 To supplement the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with, or as an alternative to U.S. GAAP. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance that either excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have such an effect, that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable financial measure that is calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this Form 10-K are tangible return on average tangible equity, tangible equity per common share and adjusted efficiency ratio. Certain additional non-GAAP financial measures that are components of the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures are also set forth and reconciled in the table below. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance, and allow comparability to prior periods. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 East West Bancorp, Inc.: 
 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of East West Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 27, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Allowance for loan losses for loans evaluated on a collective pool basis 
 As discussed in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s allowance for loan losses (ALL) is established as management s estimate of expected credit losses inherent in the Company s lending activities. As of December 31, 2022 the ALL was 596 million, which includes the ALL for commercial loans evaluated on a collective pool basis (the commercial collective ALL). The ALL is the portion of the loan s amortized cost basis that the Company does not expect to collect due to anticipated credit losses over the loan s contractual life, adjusted for estimated prepayments. The Company measured the expected credit losses on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics existed. The December 31, 2022 commercial collective ALL included quantitative and qualitative components (together, the collective ALL). The Company developed and documented the collective ALL methodology at the portfolio segment level. The collective ALL methodology used various models and estimation techniques based on the Company s historical loss experience, current borrower characteristics, which included internal risk ratings, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable macroeconomic forecasts. The commercial loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial (C I) and commercial real estate (CRE), which also included multifamily residential, and construction and land loans. The Company s C I lifetime loss rate model estimated credit losses by estimating a loss rate expected over the life of a loan 
 76 

which is applied to the amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest receivables, to determine expected credit losses. The Company s CRE projected probability of defaults PDs and loss given defaults LGDs are applied to the estimated exposure at default, considering the term and payment structure of the loan, to generate estimates of expected loss. The Company incorporated forward-looking information using macroeconomic scenarios, which included variables that are considered key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses. A probability-weighted multiple scenario forecast over a reasonable and supportable forecast period is incorporated into both the quantitative models. The Company s C I lifetime loss rate model reverts to the historical average loss rate, expressed through the loan-level lifetime loss rate, after the reasonable and supportable forecast period. The Company s CRE model considers the contractual life of the loans and the forecast of future economic conditions return to long-run historical economic trends within the reasonable and supportable period. In order to estimate the life of a loan under both quantitative models, the contractual term of the loan is adjusted for estimated prepayments based on historical prepayment experience. The Company also considered qualitative factors in determining the commercial collective ALL, if these factors have not already been captured by the quantitative model. 
 We identified the assessment of the December 31, 2022 commercial collective ALL as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment due to significant measurement uncertainty. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the collective ALL methodology, including an evaluation of the conceptual soundness and performance of the methods and models used to estimate (1) the quantitative component and its significant data elements and assumptions, which included portfolio segments, historic loss experience, reasonable and supportable forecast period, internal risk ratings, probability-weighted macroeconomic forecast scenarios, contractual term of the loan adjusted for estimated prepayments, and (2) the qualitative component. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained. 
 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company s measurement of the collective ALL estimates, including controls over the: 
 
 development of the collective ALL methodology 
 
 continued use and appropriateness of changes made to the quantitative models 
 
 performance monitoring of the quantitative models for the December 31, 2022 commercial collective ALL 
 
 identification and determination of the significant data elements and assumptions used in the quantitative models 
 
 development of the qualitative component 
 
 analysis of the collective ALL results, trends, and ratios. 
 
 We evaluated the Company s process to develop the collective ALL estimates by testing the models, significant data elements and assumptions that the Company used, and considered the relevance and reliability of such models, data, factors, and assumptions. We performed ratio and trend analysis over key ratios and peer comparison information relevant to the collective ALL. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: 
 
 evaluating the Company s collective ALL methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 
 
 evaluating judgments made by the Company relative to the assessment, conceptual soundness and performance testing of the quantitative models, which are based on historical loss experience by comparing them to relevant Company-specific metrics and trends and the applicable industry and regulatory practices 
 
 evaluating the judgments made by the Company in selecting the macroeconomic forecast scenarios, including the reasonable and supportable period and the related probability-weighted macroeconomic forecast scenarios 
 
 determining whether the loan portfolio is pooled based on loans with similar risk characteristics by comparing to the Company s business environment and relevant industry practices 
 
 evaluating risk ratings for a selection of collectively evaluated loans 
 
 77 

evaluating the conceptual soundness of the framework used to develop the qualitative factors and the effect of those factors on the collective ALL compared with relevant credit risk factors and consistency with credit trends and identified limitations of the underlying quantitative models. 
 
 We also assessed the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained related to the collective ALL estimates by evaluating the: 
 
 cumulative results of audit procedures 
 
 qualitative aspects of the Company s accounting practices 
 
 potential bias in accounting estimates.

 The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment annually, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired when the fair value, which is the expected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life, is less than the net book value. The excess of the net book value over its fair value is charged as impairment loss to noninterest expense. 
 
 reporting segments: (1) Consumer and Business Banking; (2) Commercial Banking; and (3) Other. For information on how the reporting units are identified and the components are aggregated, see Note 17 Business Segments to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill or elect to bypass the qualitative test and proceed directly to a quantitative test. If the Company performs a qualitative assessment of goodwill to test for impairment and concludes it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is greater than its carrying value, quantitative tests are not required. If the qualitative analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value, the Company is required to perform a quantitative assessment to determine if there is goodwill impairment. Factors considered in the qualitative assessments include but are not limited to macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, financial performance of the respective operating segment and other reporting unit specific considerations. The Company uses a combined income and market approach in its quantitative valuation methodologies. A quantitative valuation involves determining the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing the fair value to its corresponding carrying value. Goodwill impairment loss is recorded as a charge to noninterest expense and an adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill. Subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment are not allowed.

 Deposit Service Charges and Related Fee Income The Company offers a range of deposit products to individuals and businesses, which includes savings, money market, checking and time deposit accounts. The deposit account services include ongoing account maintenance, as well as certain optional services such as various in-branch services, automated teller machine/debit card usage, wire transfer services or check orders. In addition, treasury management and business account analysis services are offered to commercial deposit customers. The monthly account fees may vary with the amount of average monthly deposit balances maintained, or the Company may charge a fixed monthly account maintenance fee if certain average balances are not maintained. In addition, each time a deposit customer selects an optional service, the Company may earn transaction fees, generally recognized by the Company at the point when the transaction occurs. For business analysis accounts, commercial deposit customers receive an earnings credit based on their account balance, which can be used to offset the cost of banking and treasury management services. Business analysis accounts that are assessed fees in excess of earnings credits received are typically charged at the end of each month, after all transactions are known and the credits are calculated. Deposit service charge and related fee income are recognized in all operating segments. 
 
 Card Income Card income consists of merchant referral fees and interchange income. For merchant referral fees, the Company provides marketing and referral services to acquiring banks for merchant card processing services and earns variable referral fees based on transaction activities. The Company satisfies its performance obligation over time as the Company identifies, solicits, and refers business customers who are provided such services. The Company receives monthly fees net of consideration it pays to the acquiring bank performing the merchant card processing services. The Company recognizes revenue on a monthly basis when the uncertainty associated with the variable referral fees is resolved after the Company receives monthly statements from the acquiring bank. For interchange income, the Company, as a card issuer, has a stand ready performance obligation to authorize, clear, and settle card transactions. The Company earns or pays interchange fees, which are percentage-based on each transaction, and based on rates published by the corresponding payment network for transactions processed using their network. The Company measures its progress toward the satisfaction of its performance obligation over time as services are rendered, and the Company provides continuous access to this service and settles transactions as its customer or the payment network requires. Interchange income is presented net of direct costs paid to the customer and entities in their distribution chain, which are transaction-based expenses such as rewards program expenses and certain network costs. Revenue is recognized when the net profit is determined by the payment networks at the end of each day. Card income is recognized in consumer and business banking, and commercial banking segments.

 Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include certain individually evaluated loans held-for-investment, investments in qualified affordable housing partnerships, tax credit and other investments, OREO, loans held-for-sale, and other nonperforming assets. Nonrecurring fair value adjustments result from the impairment on certain individually evaluated loans held-for-investment and investments in qualified affordable housing partnerships, tax credit and other investments, from write-downs of OREO and other nonperforming assets, or from the application of lower of cost or fair value on loans held-for-sale. 
 
 Individually Evaluated Loans Held-for-Investment Individually evaluated loans held-for-investment are classified as Level 3 assets. The following two methods are used to derive the fair value of individually evaluated loans held-for-investment: 
 Discounted cash flow valuation techniques that consist of developing an expected stream of cash flows over the life of the loans, and then calculating the present value of the loans by discounting the expected cash flows at a designated discount rate.

AFS debt securities in a gross unrealized loss position with credit impairment, primarily consisting of U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities, non-agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt securities, and U.S. Treasury securities. In comparison, as of December 31, 2021, the Company had AFS debt securities in a gross unrealized loss position with credit impairment, primarily consisting of U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities, U.S. government agency and U.S. government-sponsored agency debt securities, U.S. Treasury securities, and corporate debt securities. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Available-for-Sale Debt Securities 
 
 The Company evaluates each AFS debt security where the fair value has declined below amortized cost. For a discussion of the factors and criteria the Company uses in analyzing securities for impairment related to credit losses, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Significant Accounting Policies Allowance for Credit Losses on Available-for-Sale Debt Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 
 
 The gross unrealized losses presented in the preceding tables were primarily attributable to interest rate movement and the widening of liquidity and/or credit spreads. U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agency, U.S. government-sponsored agency, and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed securities are issued, guaranteed, or otherwise supported by the U.S. government and have a zero credit loss assumption. The other securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2022 were mainly comprised of the following: 
 Non-agency mortgage-backed securities The market value decline as of December 31, 2022, was primarily due to interest rate movement and spread widening. Since these securities are rated investment grade by NRSROs, or have high priority in the cash flow waterfall within the securitization structure, and the contractual payments have historically been on time, the Company believes the risk of credit losses on these securities is low. 
 Corporate debt securities The market value decline as of December 31, 2022 was primarily due to interest rate movement and spread widening. Since these securities are nearly all rated investment grade by NRSROs or, if not, the issuer is a well-capitalized financial institution with strong profitability, and the contractual payments from these bonds have been, and are expected to be, received on time, the Company believes the risk of credit losses on these securities is low. 
 
 As of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had the intent to hold the AFS debt securities with unrealized losses through the anticipated recovery period and it was more-likely-than-not that the Company will not have to sell these securities before the recovery of their amortized cost. The issuers of these securities have not, to the Company s knowledge, established any cause for default on these securities. As a result, the Company expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of these securities. Accordingly, there was allowance for credit losses as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021 against these securities. In addition, there was provision for credit losses recognized for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities 
 
 The Company separately evaluates its HTM debt securities for any credit losses using an expected loss model, similar to the methodology used for loans. For additional information on the Company s credit loss methodology, refer to Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Significant Accounting Policies Allowance for Credit Losses on Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 
 
 The Company monitors the credit quality of the HTM debt securities using external credit ratings. As of December 31, 2022, all HTM securities were rated investment grade by NRSROs and issued, guaranteed, or supported by U.S. government entities and agencies. Accordingly, the Company applied a zero credit loss assumption and allowance for credit losses was recorded as of December 31, 2022. Overall, the Company believes that the credit support levels of the debt securities are strong and, based on current assessments and macroeconomic forecasts, expects that full contractual cash flows will be received.

 Fair Value Hedges The Company entered into interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of certain certificates of deposit due to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate. The interest rate swaps converted the certificates of deposit from fixed-rate payments to floating-rate payments. Changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps and certificates of deposit were recorded in Interest Expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income. During 2020, both the hedging interest rate swaps and hedged certificates of deposit were called. Net gains of million were recognized on the interest rate swaps, while net losses of million were recognized on hedged certificates of deposit for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company did t have any fair value hedges during both 2022 and 2021. 
 
 Cash Flow Hedges The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in interest payments received on certain floating-rate commercial loans, or paid on certain floating-rate borrowings due to changes in contractually specified interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, billion and million in notional amounts of interest rate contracts were designated as cash flow hedges to convert certain variable-rate loans and borrowings, respectively. Gains and losses on the hedging derivative instruments are recognized in AOCI and reclassified to earnings in the same period the hedged cash flows impact earnings and within the same income statement line as the hedged cash flows. Considering the interest rates, yield curve and notional amounts as of December 31, 2022, the Company expects to reclassify an estimated million of after-tax net losses on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges from AOCI into earnings during the next 12 months.

 Net Investment Hedges The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of the Bank s investment in East West Bank (China) Limited, a non-USD functional currency subsidiary in China. The hedging instruments designated as net investment hedges were used to hedge against the risk of adverse changes in the foreign currency exchange rate of the RMB.

 Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments 
 
 Customer-Related Positions and other Economic Hedge Derivatives The Company enters into interest rate, commodity, and foreign exchange derivatives at the request of its customers and generally enters into offsetting derivative contracts with third-party financial institutions to mitigate the inherent market risk. Income primarily results from the spread between the customer derivative and the offsetting dealer position. Certain offsetting derivative contracts entered by the Company are cleared though the central clearing organizations where variation margin is applied daily as settlement to the fair values of the contracts. Applying variation margin payments as settlement to the fair values of derivative contracts cleared through London Clearing House LCH and Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME resulted in reductions in the derivative asset and liability fair values of million and million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. In comparison, applying variation margin payments as settlement to LCH and CME-cleared derivative transactions resulted in reductions in the derivative asset and liability fair values of million and million, respectively, as of December 31, 2021. 
 
 The Company also utilizes foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the effect of currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency-denominated on-balance sheet assets and liabilities. A majority of the foreign exchange contracts had original maturities of or less as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021.

 Credit Contracts The Company periodically enters into credit RPAs with institutional counterparties to manage the credit exposure of the interest rate contracts associated with syndication loans. Under the RPAs, a portion of the credit exposure is transferred from one party (the purchaser of credit protection) to another party (the seller of credit protection). The seller of credit protection is required to make payments to the purchaser of credit protection if the underlying borrower defaults on the related interest rate contract. The Company may enter into protection sold or protection purchased RPAs. Credit risk on RPAs is managed by monitoring the credit worthiness of the borrowers and the institutional counterparties, which is a part of the normal credit review and monitoring process. The majority of the reference entities of the protection sold RPAs were investment grade and the weighted-average remaining maturity was years and years, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Assuming that the underlying borrowers referenced in the interest rate contracts defaulted as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the maximum exposure of protection sold RPAs would be and million, respectively. The Company did not have any outstanding protection purchased RPAs as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 
 Equity Contracts From time to time, as part of the Company s loan origination process, the Company obtains warrants to purchase preferred and/or common stock of technology and life sciences companies to which it provides loans. Warrants grant the Company the right to buy a certain class of the underlying company s equity at a certain price before expiration.

 Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features Certain of the Company s over-the-counter derivative contracts contain early termination provisions that require the Company to settle any outstanding balances upon the occurrence of a specified credit-risk-related event. Such event primarily relates to a downgrade in the credit rating of East West Bank to below investment grade. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate fair value amounts of all derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position totaled million, in which million of collateral was posted to cover these positions. In comparison, as of December 31, 2021, the aggregate fair value amounts of all derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position totaled million, in which million of collateral was posted to cover these positions. In the event that the credit rating of East West Bank had been downgraded to below investment grade, minimal additional collateral would have been required to be posted as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

 The allowance for credit losses was million as of December 31, 2022, an increase of million, compared with million as of December 31, 2021. The increase in the allowance for credit losses was primarily driven by the current economic outlook, which reflected ongoing concerns with inflation, global supply chain disruptions and rising interest rates, as well as loan growth. 
 
 The Company considers multiple economic scenarios to develop the estimate of the allowance for loan losses. The scenarios may consist of a baseline forecast representing management's view of the most likely outcome, and downside or upside scenarios that reflect possible worsening or improving economic conditions. As of December 31, 2022, the Company assigned a lower weighting to its downside scenario and higher weightings to the baseline and upside scenarios, compared with the weightings assigned as of December 31, 2021. This was because the current baseline economic forecast better reflected, compared with a year ago, the impact of high inflation, lower than previously anticipated annual GDP growth, rising interest rates, and continued global oil and supply chain issues. Macroeconomic assumptions underlying the baseline forecast included a lower annual GDP growth from for 2022 to for 2023 and an increase in the average unemployment rate from in 2022 to for 2023. The downside scenario assumed that worsening supply chain issues and rising inflation would cause a broad economic recession in 2023 with the annual GDP growth rate dropping to an average decline of and the average unemployment rate rising to in 2023. The upside scenario assumed a more optimistic economic outlook for 2023, including higher GDP growth of , the unemployment rate improving to , and no recession concerns.

The Company is subject to income tax examination by the IRS for the tax years 2019 and forward. The Company is also subject to tax examination in various state jurisdictions for the tax years 2017 and forward.

Failure to meet the minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory actions and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company and the Bank are also subject to maintain a capital conservation buffer of above the minimum risk-based capital ratios under the Basel III Capital Rules. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but which does not exceed the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, share repurchases and executive compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. 
 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 requires that the federal regulatory agencies adopt regulations defining capital categories for banks: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Under the agencies Prompt Corrective Action regulations, failure of a bank to be well capitalized results in an escalating series of adverse regulatory consequences. 
 
 Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326) Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial instrument that introduced the CECL methodology . In March 2020, the federal banking agencies issued the Interim Final Rule that provided banking organizations that adopted the CECL with the phase-in option to delay the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital. The Bank and the Company have elected the CECL phase-in option in 2020 and delayed the impact of CECL on regulatory capital through 2021, after which the effects are being phased in over a three-year period from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024.

 reportable operating segments: (1) Consumer and Business Banking; (2) Commercial Banking; and (3) Other. These segments are defined by the type of customers served, and the related products and services provided. The segments reflect how financial information is currently evaluated by management. Operating segment results are based on the Company s internal management reporting process, which reflects assignments and allocations of certain balance sheet and income statement items. The information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities due to the interrelationships among the segments. 
 
 The Consumer and Business Banking segment primarily provides financial products and services to consumer and commercial customers through the Company s domestic branch network and digital banking platform. This segment offers consumer and commercial deposits, mortgage and home equity loans, and other products and services. It also originates commercial loans for small- and medium-sized enterprises through the Company s branch network. Other products and services provided by this segment include wealth management, treasury management, interest rate risk hedging and foreign exchange services. 
 
 The Commercial Banking segment primarily generates commercial loan and deposit products. Commercial loan products include CRE lending, construction finance, commercial business lending, working capital lines of credit, trade finance, letters of credit, affordable housing lending, asset-based lending, asset-backed finance, project finance and equipment financing. Commercial deposit products and other financial services include treasury management, foreign exchange services and interest rate and commodity risk hedging. 
 
 The remaining centralized functions, including the corporate treasury activities of the Company and eliminations of inter-segment amounts, have been aggregated and included in the Other segment, which provides broad administrative support to the core segments, namely the Consumer and Business Banking and the Commercial Banking segments.

operating segments within the Company. The internal reporting process derives operating segment results by utilizing allocation methodologies for revenues and expenses. Net interest income of each segment represents the difference between actual interest earned on assets and interest incurred on liabilities of the segment, adjusted for funding charges or credits through the Company s internal funds transfer pricing FTP process. Noninterest income and noninterest expense directly attributable to a business segment are assigned to that segment. Indirect costs, including technology-related costs and corporate overhead, are allocated based on a segment s estimated usage using factors including but not limited to, full-time equivalent employees, net interest income, and loan and deposit volume. Charge-offs are recorded to the segment directly associated with the respective loans charged off, and provision for credit losses is recorded to the segments based on the related loans for which allowances are evaluated. The Company s internal reporting process utilizes a full-allocation methodology. Under this methodology, corporate and indirect expenses incurred by the Other segment are allocated to the Consumer and Business Banking and the Commercial Banking segments, except certain corporate treasury-related expenses and insignificant unallocated expenses. 
 
 The corporate treasury function within the Other segment is responsible for the Company s liquidity and interest rate management. The Company s internal FTP process is also managed by the corporate treasury function included within the Other segment. The process is formulated with the goal of encouraging loan and deposit growth that is consistent with the Company s overall profitability objectives, as well as to provide a reasonable and consistent basis for the measurement of its business segments net interest margins and profitability. The FTP process charges a cost to fund loans FTP charges for loans and allocates credits for funds provided from deposits FTP credits for deposits using internal FTP rates. FTP charges for loans are determined based on a matched cost of funds, which is tied to the pricing and term characteristics of the loans. FTP credits for deposits are based on matched funding credit rates, which are tied to the implied or stated maturity of the deposits. FTP credits for deposits reflect the long-term value generated by the deposits. The net spread between the total internal FTP charges and credits is recorded as part of net interest income in the Other segment. The FTP process transfers the corporate interest rate risk exposure to the treasury function within the Other segment, where such exposures are centrally managed. The Company s internal FTP assumptions and methodologies are reviewed at least annually to ensure that the process is reflective of current market conditions.

 As of December 31, 2022, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), the Company conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. 
 
 The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ).

 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act). The Company s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 using the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements, issued an audit report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The audit report is presented on the following page.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 East West Bancorp, Inc.: 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited East West Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee 
 of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 27, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
