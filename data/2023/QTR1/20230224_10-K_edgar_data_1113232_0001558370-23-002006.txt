Industry Overview Semiconductor chips, also known as integrated circuits, are used in a continuously evolving range of consumer and industrial products, including for example, personal computers, mobile devices, automobiles, sensors and controllers for the internet of things and data storage servers. Types of semiconductor chips include dynamic random-access memory DRAM and Not AND NAND Flash memory; logic devices to process information; and system on chip devices (which have both logic and memory features). The demand for chips continues to increase, as a result of the electrification of vehicles, the evolution of digital communications (including the introduction of 5G mobile networks and the growth in the Internet of Things), and the increasing complexity of device features. These chips are used in power management, data input, such as image sensors, which are often manufactured using mature processing technologies, as well as for memory to support the storage of data, internet streaming and cloud computing data analytics. Most semiconductor chips are built on silicon wafers of either 200mm (8 inches) or 300mm (12 inches) in diameter. Each semiconductor chip is made up of millions of tiny transistors or switches to control the functions of the device. Transistors are created in the silicon wafer by introducing various precisely placed impurities into the silicon in specific patterns. Semiconductor chip manufacturers own or manage wafer fabrication facilities (often referred to as fabs ), which utilize many different types of equipment in the making of integrated circuits. Over 300 process steps utilizing over 50 different types of process tools are required to make a single device like a microprocessor. Semiconductor chip manufacturers seek device performance benefits through new products and technology enhancements and productivity improvements through increased throughput, equipment utilization and higher manufacturing yields. Capacity is added by increasing the amount of manufacturing equipment in existing fabrication facilities and by constructing new fabrication facilities. We have different types of customers, which impacts the timing of purchases and technology requirements. Some customers are integrated electronics manufacturers, making semiconductor chips for their own devices. These same companies may also act as foundries, manufacturing semiconductor chips for other electronic manufacturers or chip design companies. Some customers only function as foundries. A few companies design and manufacture branded chips that are sold to device manufacturers. In addition, some customers have partnerships or joint ventures with two or more semiconductor chip manufacturers to share the technology development and capital investment. The timing of purchases by foundry customers will depend on their success in securing manufacturing contracts. Also, foundry customers will look for equipment that can deliver the broadest capabilities in order to be prepared to manufacture all chip types, while integrated electronics manufacturers may invest in processing equipment dedicated to a specific application they require for their products. The semiconductor capital equipment industry has historically been cyclical as global chip production capacities successively exceed, then lag behind, global chip demand. When chip demand is high, and inventories are low, chip manufacturers add capacity through capital equipment purchases. Given the difficulties of forecasting and calibrating chip demand and production capacity, the industry periodically experiences excess chip inventories and softening chip prices. Device manufacturers react with muted capital spending, lowering the demand for capital equipment. Changes in consumer and business demand for products in which chips are used also affect the industry. A successful semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer must not only provide some of the most technically complex products manufactured in the world but also must manage its business to thrive during low points in the cycle.

We strive for operational excellence by focusing on ways to lower our product, manufacturing and design costs and to improve our delivery times to our customers. Global customer teams and a focused account management structure maintain and strengthen our customer relationships and increase customer satisfaction. Finally, we endeavor to maintain a strong cash balance to ensure sufficient capital to fund business growth. Ion Implantation Systems Ion implantation is a principal step in the transistor formation cycle of the semiconductor chip manufacturing process. Ion implantation is also used to change the material characteristics of the silicon for reasons other than electrical doping, a process known as material modification. An ion implanter is a large, technically advanced system that injects dopants such as arsenic, boron or phosphorus into a wafer. These dopants are ionized and therefore have an electrical charge state. This electric charge state allows the dopants to be accelerated, focused and filtered with electric and magnetic fields. Ion implanters use these fields to create a beam of ions with a precisely defined energy level (ranging between several hundred and eight million electron-volts) and with a precisely defined beam current level (ranging from microamps to milliamps). Certain areas of the silicon wafer are blocked off by a polymer material known as photoresist, which acts as a stencil to pattern devices so that the dopants will only enter the wafer where needed. Typical process flows require twenty implant steps, with the most advanced processes requiring substantially more steps. Each implant step is characterized by four key parameters: dopant type, dose (amount of dopant), energy (depth into the silicon) and tilt/twist (angle of wafer relative to the ion beam). 
 4 

In order to efficiently cover the wide range of implant steps, three different broad categories of implanters have been developed, each targeted at a specific range of applications, primarily defined by dose and energy. The three traditional implanter categories are referred to as high current, high energy and medium current: High current implanters were the second type of implanter to emerge, having low energy capability and high dose range. High energy implanters emerged to address the need for deeper implants with a high energy range and low dose. Medium current implanters are the original model of ion implanter, with mid to low-range energy and dose capability. The Purion Platform and Family of Ion Implanters Axcelis offers a complete line of high energy, high current and medium current implanters for all application requirements. Our Purion flagship systems are all based on a common platform which enables a unique combination of implant purity, precision and productivity. Combining a state-of-the-art single wafer end station, with advanced spot beam architectures (that ensures all points across the wafer see the same beam condition at the same beam angle), Purion products enable exceptional process control to optimize device performance and yield, at high productivity. High Current Implant. Our Purion H, Purion Dragon and Purion H200 spot beam, high current systems cover all traditional high current requirements as well as those associated with emerging and future devices. Our Purion high current capabilities extend beyond traditional high current energy and dose ranges, in order to cover new device fabrication requirements as well as to maximize capital utilization and flexibility. In addition, Axcelis Purion systems provide advantages for material modification applications, including those requiring hot and cold implant capabilities. High Energy Implant. Our Purion XE and other Purion high energy systems combine Axcelis production-proven RF Linac high energy, spot beam technology with the Purion platform wafer handling system. Axcelis has been a market leader in high energy ion implanters for many years and continues to offer legacy high energy systems, as well as a range of new Purion systems which have differentiated capabilities for specialty applications. Medium Current Implant. Our Purion M Si and SiC medium current system offers higher productivity and lower electrical energy consumption compared to competitive offerings, in addition to other advantages. Our Purion M systems also offer differentiated capabilities for specialty applications. In addition to the above categories, ion implanters may also be categorized by the types of applications for which they are designed. For example, the Axcelis Purion Power Series, which provides full recipe coverage for power device applications critical to mobile devices and electric vehicles, is comprised of a group of high current, medium current and high energy implanters that have been developed to optimize semiconductor devices created on Silicon Carbide wafers, which are advantageous for certain power devices. We believe our ion implant products will continue to meet customer demand for advantages in productivity, process performance and technical extendibility. Aftermarket Support and Services Through our CS I business, we offer our customers extensive aftermarket service and support throughout the lifecycle of the equipment we manufacture. We believe that approximately 3,100 of our products are in use in 28 countries worldwide. The service and support that we provide includes used tools, spare parts, equipment upgrades, and maintenance services. We offer varying levels of sales, service and application support out of our field offices. Revenue generated 
 5 

through our CS I business of 227.9 million, 207.8 million and 180.9 million represents 24.8 , 31.4 and 38.1 of total revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. To support our aftermarket business, we have sales and marketing personnel, field service engineers, and spare parts and applications engineers, as well as employees located at our manufacturing facilities who work with our customers to provide customer training and documentation, and product, process and applications support. Most of our customers maintain spare parts inventories for our machines. In addition to our web-based spare parts management and replenishment tracking program, we offer a number of Business-to-Business options to support our customers parts management requirements. Our Axcelis Managed Inventory service offering provides the customer with full spare parts support through a parts consignment arrangement in which Axcelis retains responsibility for the complete supply chain. These services provide ease of use alternatives that reduce order fulfillment costs and improve cycle time, resulting in an expanded customer base for this service offering. Sales and Marketing We primarily sell our equipment and services through our direct sales force. We conduct sales and marketing activities from our sales offices located in the United States, Taiwan, South Korea, China, Singapore, Japan, Germany and Italy. International revenue, including export sales from our U.S. manufacturing facilities to foreign customers and sales by foreign subsidiaries and branches, accounted for 84.4 , 92.6 and 89.3 of total revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2022, approximately 90.9 of our sales were denominated in U.S. dollars. See Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 15 of this Form 10-K for a breakdown of our revenue and long-lived assets in the United States, Europe and Asia. See also Item 1A, Risk Factors, for information about risks attendant to our foreign operations. Customers In 2022, according to Gartner Inc., the top 20 semiconductor chip manufacturers accounted for approximately 89.0 of total semiconductor capital equipment spending, which decreased from 92.0 in 2021. These manufacturers are from the largest semiconductor chip manufacturing regions in the world: the United States, Asia Pacific (Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Japan and China) and Europe. Information on net sales to unaffiliated customers is included in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended December 31, 2022, revenues from Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd. and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation SMIC represented 10 or more of our consolidated revenues. The loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business. U.S. export controls impact our ability to sell to certain customers in China, a country that has represented a significant portion of our sales in recent years. Since the placement of SMIC on the U.S. Entity List in 2020, we are required to obtain export control licenses to ship to mature process SMIC fabs, which to date, we have been able to obtain. Another chipmaker, Yangtze Memory Technologies Co., Ltd. YMTC ), was placed on the Entity List in 2022, without a similar policy allowing licensed shipments. A new export controls regulatory framework was issued by the U.S. in October 2022 that limits all semiconductor equipment shipments to Chinese customers who are producing or developing logic, DRAM and NAND chips that meet specific advanced parameters. While these regulations have further excluded exports to certain Chinese customers, we currently are able to continue to ship to the majority of our Chinese customers. In general, however, sales to Chinese customers represent a higher risk than sales to customers in other international locations because of trade tensions between the U.S. government and the Chinese government, and other challenges reflecting China s stage of development, including public health concerns and rapid growth. Research and Development Our industry continues to experience rapid technological change, requiring us to frequently introduce new products and enhancements. Our Beverly, Massachusetts Advanced Technology Center houses a process development 
 6 

laboratory with a 13,500 square feet class 10/100/1000 clean room for product demonstrations and process development and a 17,500 square feet customer training center. The Advanced Technology Center provides infrastructure and process capabilities that allow customers to test their unique process steps on our systems under conditions that substantially replicate the customers production environments. This facility also provides significant capability for our research and development efforts. We devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to research and development programs and seek to maintain close relationships with our customers to remain responsive to their product needs. We have also sought to reduce the development cycle for new products through a collaborative process whereby our engineering, manufacturing and marketing personnel work closely together with one another and with our customers at an earlier stage in the process. We use 3D, computer-aided design, finite element analysis and other computer-based modeling methods to test new designs. Our expenses for research and development were 78.4 million, 65.4 million and 61.8 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, or 8.5 , 9.9 and 13.0 of revenue, respectively. Manufacturing We manufacture products at our 417,000 square feet ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015 certified plant in Beverly, Massachusetts as well as our 38,000 square feet Axcelis Asia Operations Center in South Korea. Our facilities employ best in class manufacturing techniques, including lean manufacturing, six sigma controls and advanced inventory management, purchasing and quality systems. In 2022, we signed an additional lease of property in Beverly, Massachusetts, on which a state-of-the-art logistics and flex manufacturing center with 98,000 square feet is being built to our specifications, referred to as the Axcelis Logistics Center. Our clean manufacturing process uses class 1,000/10,000 space to facilitate most of our manufacturing requirements. Our core competency in manufacturing and supply chain management is built around system assembly and testing, which remains an in-house capability due to the high degree of expertise and intellectual property associated with the process and design. Non-core work is sourced to global partners and includes items such as vacuum systems, wafer handling and commodity-level components. We continuously pursue outsourcing opportunities where the economics are justified, with a goal of enabling quality and margin improvement. Our supply chain team is globally focused and is located in Beverly, Korea and Singapore. Customized and commercially available software solutions drive our planning, purchasing and inventory tracking process. The companies supplying Axcelis play a critical part in our success. We want to ensure these companies share our values and have adopted a Supplier Code of Conduct, which contains our expectation that our suppliers will comply with our Environmental Policy, our Corporate Social Responsibility Policy, and other industry standards and policies. Our Supplier Code of Conduct provides that if a supplier fails to comply with these policies, our business relationship with that company will be permanently ended, although a compliance remediation period of up to 90 days may be allowed. In 2022, Axcelis audited 54 suppliers for compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct and other quality standards. The outcome of these and prior audits included (i) the issuance of a total of over 190 corrective actions to suppliers, (ii) requiring more than 30 of our suppliers to participate in quarterly reviews focused on improvement projects, and (iii) subjecting two suppliers to more comprehensive audits and action plans. Our products are designed to be assembled and tested in a modular fashion, which facilitates our industry-recognized ship-from-cell process. Specially developed test stands, software and tooling provide the framework for this accelerated delivery process. Customers that choose the ship-from-cell process substantially improve their delivery times while receiving the same high level of quality provided by more traditional, longer cycle integration techniques. Product margins and inventory turns also improve as a result of shorter factory cycle times and increased labor productivity. Installation of our equipment is provided by factory and field teams. The process includes assembling the equipment at our installation site, and after it has been connected, recalibrating it to factory specifications.

Competition The semiconductor equipment industry is highly competitive and is characterized by a small number of participants ranging in size. Significant competitive factors in the semiconductor capital equipment market include price, cost of ownership, equipment performance, customer support, capabilities and breadth of product line. In the area ion implantation, we mainly compete against Applied Materials, Inc. Axcelis and Applied Materials are the only ion implant manufacturers with a full range of implant products, as well as service and support infrastructures able to service our customers globally. Other non-U.S. players we compete with include Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ion Technology Co. Ltd. and Nissin Ion Equipment Co., Ltd in Japan, Advanced Ion Beam Technology, Inc. in Taiwan, as well as CETC Electronics Equipment Group Co., Ltd. in the People s Republic of China. Non-U.S. suppliers may have an advantage over U.S. suppliers under recently established U.S. export controls regulation for shipments to China. Intellectual Property We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection in the United States and in other countries, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our proprietary rights in our products and our business. As of December 31, 2022, we had 209 active patents issued in the United States and 467 active patents granted in other countries, as well as 213 patent applications (29 in the United States and 184 in other countries) on file with various patent agencies worldwide. Patents are generally in effect for up to 20 years from the filing of the application. We intend to file additional patent applications and grow our intellectual property portfolio as appropriate. Although patents are important to our business, we do not believe that we are substantially dependent on any single patent or any group of patents. We have trademarks, both registered and unregistered, that are maintained to provide customer recognition for our products in the marketplace. Trademark registrations generally remain in effect as long as the trademarks are in use. From time to time, we enter into license agreements with third parties under which we obtain or grant rights to patented or proprietary technology. We do not believe that any of our licenses are currently material to us. Backlog Systems backlog, including deferred systems revenue, was 1,124.2 million and 460.6 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We believe it is meaningful to investors to include deferred systems revenue as part of our backlog. Deferred systems revenue represents revenue that will be recognized in future periods based on prior shipments or customer prepayments. Our policy is to include in backlog only those system orders for which we have accepted purchase orders. All orders are subject to cancellations or rescheduling by customers with limited or no penalties. Backlog does not include orders received and fulfilled within a quarter. Our backlog at the beginning of a quarter typically does not include all orders required to achieve our sales objectives for that quarter. Backlog is not necessarily an indicator of future business trends because orders for services or parts received during the quarter are generally performed or shipped within the same quarter. Bookings in the quarter ended December 31, 2022 were 211.5 million compared to 194.0 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2021. Human Capital As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,388 employees and 97 agency temporary staff worldwide. During 2022, our total employee and temporary staff headcount increased by approximately 24 to support our increased business during the year. While the majority of our headcount is based in the U.S. at our main manufacturing facility in Beverly, MA, our business requires our presence where our customers are located around the world, resulting in Axcelis employees working in 28 different countries. Of our total year end 2022 employees, 966 work in North America, 349 in Asia and 73 in Europe.

Our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We provide competitive compensation and benefits programs. In addition to salaries, all Axcelis employees are eligible for cash incentive programs with annual payouts tied to annual financial metrics, as described in our proxy statements, with two exceptions: (i) certain sales staff receive commission and other sales compensation, and (ii) in order to provide greater certainty of compensation to lower level U.S. employees, we pay quarterly bonuses to those employees in amounts communicated at the start of the year. Beyond these basic forms of cash compensation, we offer recognition bonuses, equity awards, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, a 401(k) plan with a competitive employer match, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, employee assistance programs, and tuition assistance. These programs all contribute to both attracting and retaining a highly skilled employee base, including those with critical leadership and industry skills and experience. During 2022, our voluntary turnover rate for employees was 13.1 , or 11.4 without retirements, well below the worldwide technology industry (all reported) voluntary turnover average of 18.4 reported in the Aon 2022 Salary Increase and Turnover Study -- December 2022. We also recognize that training is an important aspect of both employee retention and talent development. Axcelis conducts an annual talent review process and establishes individualized development programs agreed upon by employees and their managers. Human Resources provides training on personal development planning and leadership skills. All Axcelis employees have access to LinkedIn Learning to pursue independent training on business subjects. Our manufacturing staff each receives 35 hours of training upon commencement of employment, and our field service and other technical employees receive training on various ion implanter systems to develop product support, applications and service skills on all of our products. Finally, all staff are required to complete monthly, annual or biennial training on cybersecurity, various health and safety topics, and legal matters, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export controls compliance, ethical business practices, and confidentiality. At a minimum, all Axcelis employees are required to complete at least 15 hours of training per year, and they can access additional voluntary training at the Company s expense. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to health and wellness insurance and programs that offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This included having those employees that could productively work from home continue to do so, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. While all employees may now return to work in the Beverly facility, we are maintaining certain restrictions related to the manufacturing areas of the building to ensure that those members of our workforce are not unnecessarily exposed to other workers. Axcelis is dedicated to building a diverse workforce, fostering a culture built on the principle of inclusion, and maintaining a workplace free from discrimination. We strongly believe that a diversity of experience, perspectives and backgrounds will lead to a better environment for our employees and better products for our customers. Axcelis commitment to diversity extends to our Board of Directors, our leadership team and all teams and functions across our global locations.

Item 1A. Risk Factors. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Set forth below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in other documents we file with the SEC are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risk factors. Consequently, the following is not a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If semiconductor chip manufacturers do not make sufficient capital expenditures, our sales and profitability will be harmed. New systems orders and used tool sales depend upon demand from semiconductor chip manufacturers who build or expand fabrication facilities. When the rate of construction or expansion of fabrication facilities declines, demand for our systems will decline, reducing our revenue. In addition, all or a portion of the demand for increased capacity may be satisfied by a semiconductor chip manufacturer s ability to reconfigure and re-use equipment they already own. Revenue decline also hurts our profitability because our established cost structure and our continued investments in engineering, research and development, and marketing necessary to develop new products and to maintain extensive customer service and support capabilities, limit our ability to reduce expenses in proportion to declining sales. If we fail to develop and introduce reliable new or enhanced products and services that meet the needs of semiconductor chip manufacturers, our results will suffer. Rapid technological changes in semiconductor chip manufacturing processes require us to respond quickly to changing customer requirements. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to develop, manufacture and successfully introduce new systems and product lines with improved capabilities. This will depend upon a variety of factors, including new product selection, timely and efficient completion of product design and development as well as manufacturing and assembly processes, product performance in the field and effective sales and marketing. In particular: We must continue to develop competitive technical specifications for new systems, or enhancements to our existing systems, and manufacture and ship these systems or enhancements in volume in a timely manner. We will need to accurately predict the schedule on which our customers will be ready to transition to new products, in order to accurately forecast demand for new products while managing the transition from older products. We will need to effectively manage product reliability or quality problems that often exist with new systems, in order to avoid higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance and payment and additional service and warranty expenses, and ultimately, a lack of repeat orders. Our new products must be accepted in the marketplace. Our failure to meet any of these requirements will have a material adverse effect on our operating results and profitability. Axcelis is subject to the risks of operating internationally: we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from outside the United States, especially from Asia. We are substantially dependent on sales of our products and services to customers outside the United States. International sales, including export sales from our U.S. manufacturing facilities to non-U.S. customers and sales by our non-U.S. subsidiaries, accounted for 84.4 of total revenue in 2022. Customers based in Asia dominate our international sales. Ion implanter system shipments to customers in Asia represented 76.0 of total system revenue in 2022. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue. In particular, we expect 
 12 

that sales to Chinese customers (both global and domestic Chinese chip manufacturers) will continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales, creating both risk and opportunity. U.S. export controls on shipments to Chinese customers have been notably increasing since 2020. Since the placement of SMIC on the U.S. Entity List in 2020, we are required to obtain export control licenses to ship to mature process SMIC fabs, which to date, we have been able to obtain. Another chipmaker, YMTC, was placed on the Entity List in 2022, without a similar policy allowing licensed shipments. A new export controls regulatory framework was issued by the U.S. in October 2022 that limits all semiconductor equipment shipments to Chinese customers who are producing or developing logic, DRAM and NAND chips meeting specific advanced parameters. While these regulations have further excluded exports to certain Chinese customers, we currently are able to continue to ship to the majority of our Chinese customers. In general, however, continuing revenue from Chinese customers is at higher risk than continuing revenue form customers in some other international locations because of trade tensions between the United States government and the Chinese government, and other challenges reflecting China s stage of development, including public health concerns and rapid growth. Increased U.S. export controls and other political and trade tensions exacerbate the risk that Chinese customers will change suppliers to non-U.S. vendors, such as Advanced Ion Beam Technology, Inc., Nissin Ion Equipment Co., Ltd. and Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ion Technology Co., Ltd. In addition, a Chinese entity, known as CETC Electronics Equipment Group Co., Ltd., is developing ion implanters for the Chinese domestic market. The loss of a significant customer or any reduction or delays in our ability to ship to any significant customer will adversely affect us. We source a substantial portion of our materials from outside of the United States. Because of our dependence upon international sales and our global supply chain, our results and prospects may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: changes in laws or regulations resulting in more burdensome governmental controls, tariffs, restrictions, embargoes or export license requirements; volatility in currency exchange rates; political and economic instability; global health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which have the potential to disrupt our manufacturing operations and those of our supply chain, as well as cause our customers to delay or cancel shipments; difficulties in accounts receivable collections; extended payment terms beyond those customarily offered in the United States; difficulties in managing suppliers, service providers or representatives outside of the United States; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations; and potential adverse tax consequences. Our dependence upon suppliers for many components and sub-assemblies could result in increased costs or delays in the manufacture and sale of our products. We rely to a substantial extent on outside vendors to manufacture many of the components and sub-assemblies of our products. We obtain many of these components and sub-assemblies from a limited group of suppliers. Accordingly, based on situations outside of our control, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of required components on a timely basis, on price and other terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, we often quote prices to our customers and accept customer orders for our products before purchasing components and sub-assemblies from our suppliers. If our suppliers increase the cost of components or sub-assemblies, we may not have alternative sources of supply and may not be able to raise the price of our products to cover all or part of the increased cost of components, negatively impacting our gross margin. The manufacture of some of these components and sub-assemblies is an extremely complex process and requires long lead times. As a result, we could experience delays or shortages. If we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required components or sub-assemblies, we may have to seek alternative sources of supply or manufacture 
 13 

these components internally. This could delay our ability to manufacture or to ship our systems on a timely basis, causing us to lose sales, incur additional costs, delay new product introductions and suffer harm to our reputation. Moreover, if actual demand for Axcelis products is different than expected, Axcelis may purchase more or fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. If Axcelis purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or if customers reduce or delay orders, Axcelis may incur excess inventory charges. A significant portion of our revenue depends on customers electing to buy aftermarket products and services from Axcelis. Historically, a significant portion of our product revenue and all of our service revenue relates to our sale of aftermarket products and services, which include parts, consumables, upgrades, service contracts, and time and materials billings. Some of our customers purchase fewer aftermarket products and services, often training their own staff to maintain and service semiconductor capital equipment rather than relying on the equipment manufacturer for these services. In addition, we compete against third-party parts suppliers for the sale of parts and consumables that are not protected by patents or otherwise proprietary. To the extent our customers purchase parts and services from other vendors or provide their own system maintenance labor, our revenue and profitability will be reduced. If we fail to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor capital equipment industry, our sales and profitability will decline. The ion implant segment is highly competitive and includes one company with substantially greater financial, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and customer service and support resources that may better position it to compete successfully than we can, as well as several smaller companies that could provide innovative systems with technology that may have performance advantages. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their existing products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics. If we are unable to improve or introduce competing products when demanded by the markets, our business will be harmed. Finally, if we must lower prices to remain competitive without commensurate cost of goods savings, our gross margin and profitability will be adversely affected. We are dependent on sales to a limited number of large customers; the loss of a significant customer or any reduction in orders from them could materially affect our sales. Historically, we have sold a significant portion of our products and services to a limited number of semiconductor chip manufacturers. In 2022, our top ten customers accounted for 59.4 of our net sales, in comparison to 69.5 and 74.0 in 2021 and 2020, respectively. None of our customers have entered into a long- term agreement requiring it to purchase our products. One of our largest customers, SMIC, is based in China, which is subject to U.S. export controls risks, discussed above. Although the composition of the group comprising our largest customers has varied from year to year, the loss of a significant customer or any reduction or delays in orders from any significant customer will adversely affect us. Consolidation of semiconductor chip manufacturers may result in the loss of a customer. Our international operations involve currency risk. Substantially all of our system sales are billed in U.S. dollars. We also pay almost all non-U.S. vendors providing materials, components and subassemblies to our U.S. factory in U.S. dollars. However, the aftermarket revenues of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, and most of the operating expenses of these non-U.S. subsidiaries, are received and incurred in local currencies. The establishment of the Axcelis Asia Operations Center in South Korea has increased the volume of our transactions in non-U.S. dollar currencies and increased the impact of foreign exchange gain / loss on the Company s financial results. The Company experiences translation adjustments when local currency accounts payable on non-U.S. subsidiary books are re-measured for consolidated financial reporting. Similarly, the translation of long-term asset and liability values to U.S. dollars are recorded in stockholders equity as an element of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The value of the asset or liability in U.S. dollars will increase or decrease relative to the local currency based on changes in the exchange rate between the two currencies over the period. As a result, any unplanned non-cash gains or losses are recorded in the Company s consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates can 
 14 

impact reported revenues, expense, and profitability and asset values in our Consolidated Financial Statements. During the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 9.1 of our revenue was derived in local currencies from foreign operations with this inherent risk. In addition, at December 31, 2022, our operations outside of the United States accounted for approximately 10.2 of our total assets, the majority of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We may not be able to maintain and expand our business if we are not able to hire, retain and integrate qualified personnel. Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified, experienced employees. There is substantial competition for experienced engineering, technical, financial, sales and marketing personnel in our industry. In particular, we must attract and retain highly skilled design and process engineers. Competition for such personnel is intense, both in the Boston metropolitan area and in other locations around the world. If we are unable to retain our existing key personnel, or attract and retain additional qualified personnel, we may from time to time experience insufficient levels of staffing to fully develop, manufacture and market our products and perform services for our customers. As a result, our growth could be limited or we could fail to meet our delivery commitments or experience deterioration in service levels or decreased customer satisfaction, all of which could adversely affect our financial results. Our financial results may fluctuate significantly. We derive our new systems revenue from the sale of a small number of expensive products to a relatively small number of customers. The selling prices on our ion implant systems range from approximately 2.4 million to 10.0 million. We also sell used equipment in our aftermarket business. Each sale, or failure to make a sale, may have a significant effect on us in a particular quarter. In a given quarter, a number of factors can adversely affect our revenue and results, including changes in our product mix, increased fixed expenses per unit due to reductions in the number of products manufactured, and higher fixed costs due to increased levels of research and development and expansion of our worldwide sales and marketing organization. Our financial results also fluctuate based on gross profit realized on sales. A variety of factors may cause gross profit as a percentage of revenue to vary, including the mix and average selling prices of products sold, costs to manufacture and customize systems, warranty costs and the impact of changes to inventory reserves. New product introductions may also affect our gross margin. Fluctuations in our financial results may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Our financial results may fall short of anticipated levels because forecasting revenue and profitability is complex and may be inaccurate. Management may from time to time provide financial forecasts to investors. These forecasts are based on assumptions, which are believed to be reasonable when made, of the timing of system orders, system shipments, system acceptance and aftermarket revenue. Any of these assumptions can prove erroneous and the level of revenue recognizable in a particular quarter may vary from the forecast. Our lengthy sales cycle, coupled with customers competing capital budget considerations, make revenue difficult to predict. In addition, our backlog at the beginning of a quarter typically does not include all orders required to achieve our sales objectives for that quarter and is not a reliable indicator of our future sales. As a result, our revenue and operating results for a quarter depend on our shipping systems on previous orders as scheduled during that quarter, receiving customer acceptance of previously shipped products, and obtaining new orders for products and services to be provided within that same quarter. Any delay in, or cancellation of, scheduled shipments and customer acceptances or in revenue from new orders, including aftermarket revenue, could materially affect our financial results. Accounting rules addressing revenue recognition add more complexity in forecasting quarterly revenue and profitability. Orders for our products usually contain multiple performance obligations that result in revenue deferral under generally accepted accounting principles. Due to the foregoing factors, investors should understand that our actual financial results for a quarter may vary significantly from our forecasts of financial performance for that quarter. Failure to meet forecasted financial performance may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. 
 15 

The semiconductor equipment industry is cyclical and we expect that demand for our products will increase and decrease, making it difficult to manage the business and potentially causing harm to our sales and profitability. The semiconductor industry is cyclical, experiencing upturns when the demand for our products is high and downturns when our customers are not investing in new or expanded fabrication facilities. From time to time, inventory buildups in the semiconductor device industry produce an oversupply of semiconductors. This can cause a reduced demand for capital equipment such as our products, negatively impacting our sales and level of profitability. Our revenue can vary significantly from one point in the cycle to another, making it difficult to manage the business, both when revenue is increasing and when it is decreasing. In addition, a substantial portion of our operating expenses do not fluctuate with changes in volume. Significant decreases in revenue can therefore have a disproportionate effect on profitability. In addition, reduced demand for our products and services may require Axcelis to implement cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect Axcelis ability to capitalize on opportunities that arise in the future. Axcelis is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents. In the conduct of our business, Axcelis collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology systems. This data includes confidential information belonging to Axcelis, our employees or our customers or other business partners, some of which is personally-identifiable information of individuals. As reported in the 2022 Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report, cyber-attacks in the manufacturing industries are largely financially motivated, although business espionage is the objective in a strong majority of the incidents. Axcelis has been and expects to continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and incidents, including through employee error or misuse; individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information systems; and sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, none of which have had a material impact on the Company to date. Axcelis implements a Layered Security Strategy that aligns with National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. To do so, we devote significant resources to network security, data encryption, employee training and other measures to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse. This includes continuously monitoring and reacting to the cybersecurity environment, by implementing best-in-class solutions from a number of vendors. On an on-going basis, we engage a cybersecurity consultant to validate and advise on the Company s cyber landscape and to drive employee vigilance through employee cyber training and messaging. We continually replace less secure legacy systems to improve internal and external cyber defenses and maintain a cyber incident response plan including reporting and recovery processes. As discussed in our proxy statement, the full Board of Directors receive quarterly reports on cybersecurity risks and annual reports on management initiatives to promote cybersecurity. However, depending on their nature and scope, cybersecurity incidents could result in business disruption; the misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential information and critical data (Axcelis and that of third parties); reputational damage; unnecessary expense; litigation with third parties; diminution in the value of Axcelis investment in research, development and engineering; data privacy issues; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. These adverse outcomes could negatively impact our revenues, expenses, profitability and asset values. Axcelis is subject to risks associated with compliance with environmental, health and safety regulations. Axcelis is subject to environmental, health and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the development, manufacture, shipping and use of its products; handling, discharge, recycling and disposal of hazardous materials used in its products or in producing its products; the operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property. The failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations could result in: significant remediation or other legal liabilities; the imposition of penalties and fines; restrictions on the development, manufacture, sale, shipment or use of certain of its products; limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property; and a decrease in the value of its real property. Axcelis could be required to alter its manufacturing and operations and incur substantial expense in order to comply with environmental, health and safety regulations. Any failure to comply with these regulations could subject Axcelis to significant costs and liabilities that could adversely affect Axcelis business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 16 

Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by global pandemics. Global pandemics, such as COVID-19, cause disruptions and restrictions on our operations and ability to travel, and similar disruptions and restrictions impacting our suppliers or customers could adversely affect our sales and operating results. Axcelis products rely on an extensive global supply chain, and shortages of certain parts could impact our ability to meet customers shipment expectations, negatively affecting our revenues. Such pandemics may drive changes in the demand for certain of our customers products, resulting in their delay or cancelation of purchases from us. The extent to which pandemics may impact our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Our proprietary technology may be vulnerable to efforts by competitors to challenge or design around, potentially reducing our market share. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademark and trade secret laws, non-disclosure agreements and other intellectual property protection methods to protect our proprietary technology. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, our competitors may be able to challenge, design around or legitimately use the proprietary technology embedded in our systems or other technology or information used in our business. If this occurs, the value of our proprietary technology will be diminished. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our patents may not be sufficient to prevent others from using technology that is similar to or the same as our technology. Patents issued to us may be challenged and might be invalidated or circumvented and any rights granted under our patents may not provide adequate protection to us. Our competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate features of our products or design around patents that may be issued to us. As a result of these threats to our proprietary technology, we may have to resort to costly litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights. Finally, all patents expire after a period of time (in the U.S., patents expire 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application). Our market share could be negatively impacted by the invalidation or expiration of a patent which had created a barrier for our competitors. Axcelis also has agreements with third parties for licensing of patented or proprietary technology with Axcelis as the licensor or the licensee. Termination of license agreements or claims of infringement with respect to such technology could have an adverse impact on our financial performance or ability to ship products with existing configurations. We (or customers that we indemnify) might face intellectual property infringement claims or patent disputes that may be costly to resolve and, if resolved against us, could be very costly to us and prevent us from making and selling our systems. From time to time, claims and proceedings may be asserted against us relative to patent validity or infringement matters. We typically agree to indemnify our customers from liability to third parties for intellectual property infringement arising from the use of our products in their intended manner. Therefore, we may receive notification from customers who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to infringement claims made against the customers by third parties. Our involvement in any patent dispute or other intellectual property dispute or action to protect trade secrets, even if the claims are without merit, could be very expensive and could divert the attention of our management. Adverse determinations in any litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to remove certain features from our products or seek costly licenses from third parties or prevent us from manufacturing and selling our systems. In addition, infringement indemnification clauses in system sale agreements may require us to take other actions or require us to provide certain remedies to customers who are exposed to indemnified liabilities. Any of these situations could have a material adverse effect on our business results. If operations were to be disrupted at Axcelis manufacturing facilities, it would have a negative impact on our business. Our primary manufacturing facility is located in Massachusetts, with a smaller facility located in South Korea. Our operations could be subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to severe weather events, other effects of climate change, natural disasters, work stoppages, operational facility constraints and terrorism. Such disruption could cause delays in shipments of products to our customers and could result in cancellation of orders or loss of customers, which could seriously harm our business. 
 17 

If we do not have access to capital on favorable terms, on the timeline we anticipate, or at all, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We require a substantial amount of capital to meet our operating requirements and remain competitive. We routinely incur significant costs to purchase inventory to meet expected system sales, to develop and introduce new products, and to place evaluation systems at new customer sites. There can be no assurance that we will realize a return on the capital expended. Although our current cash levels and borrowing capacity are expected to be adequate for our foreseeable cash requirements, if our operating results falter, or our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate, we may incur debt to fund these requirements. Significant volatility or disruption in the global financial markets may result in us not being able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, on the timeline we anticipate, or at all, and we may not be able to refinance, if necessary, any outstanding debt when due, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Any inability to obtain financing on favorable terms, on the timeline we anticipate, or at all, may cause us to curtail our operations significantly, reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development, or obtain funds through arrangements that management does not currently anticipate, including disposing of our assets and relinquishing rights to certain technologies, the occurrence of any of which may significantly impair our ability to remain competitive, and materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors. The stock markets in general, and the markets for semiconductor equipment stocks in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. The market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors, among others, some of which are beyond our control: variations in our quarterly results; the issuance or repurchase of shares of our common stock; changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance; changes in market valuations of similar companies; announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, new products or product enhancements; loss of a major customer or failure to complete significant transactions; additions or departures of key personnel; and new positions adopted by investor stewardship groups and proxy advisory firms regarding desired environmental, social and governance disclosures, policies, ranking systems and other initiatives. The trading price of our common stock in the past has been significantly volatile, and we cannot accurately predict every potential risk that may materially and adversely affect our stock price. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. Item 2. Properties. We lease our principal facility in Beverly, Massachusetts, which comprises 417,000 square feet. The facility is principally used for manufacturing, research and development, sales/marketing, customer support, advanced process development, product demonstration, customer-training center and corporate headquarters. We also lease our Axcelis Asia Operations Center in South Korea, which comprises 38,000 square feet and is principally used for manufacturing. In 2022, we signed an additional lease of property in Beverly, Massachusetts, on which a state-of-the-art logistics and flex manufacturing center with 98,000 square feet is being built to our specifications, referred to as the Axcelis Logistics Center. We believe that our manufacturing facilities and equipment generally are well maintained, in good operating condition, suitable for our purposes, and adequate for our present operations. 
 18 

We own 23 acres of undeveloped property in Beverly, Massachusetts, adjacent to our headquarters. As of December 31, 2022, we also leased 38 other properties, of which 10 are located in the United States and the remainder are located in Asia and Europe, including offices in Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, China, Japan, Italy and Germany. These properties are used for sales and service offices and warehousing.

Overview The semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to cyclical swings in capital spending by semiconductor chip manufacturers. Capital spending is influenced by demand for semiconductors and the products using them, the utilization rate and capacity of existing semiconductor chip manufacturing facilities and changes in semiconductor technology, all of which are outside of our control. As a result, our revenue may fluctuate from year to year and period to period. Our established cost structure does not vary significantly with changes in volume. We may also experience fluctuations in operating results and cash flows depending on our revenue level. 2022 was an exceptional year for Axcelis despite logistical challenges brought on by the geo-political environment and the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the strength of the overall electronics market and the continued growth of the Purion product family in 2022, we delivered record full year revenue, operating profit and gross margin since our first full year as a public company in 2001. Revenue for 2022 was 920.0 million, an increase of 38.9 from 2021 revenue of 662.4 million. Systems revenue for 2022 was 692.1 million, compared to 454.6 million in 2021. Operating profit was 401.8 million in 2022, compared to 127.3 million in 2021. Gross margin for the year was 43.7 compared to 43.2 in 2021. Net income for the year was 183.1 million, an increase of 85.6 following a 97.4 increase in revenue from the prior year. The Company is in a strong competitive position as we participated in a period of extended industry growth in 2021 and 2022. A focused strategy on ion implant, combined with the hard work and dedication of our employees and the encouragement and support of our customers and suppliers, enabled us to achieve numerous critical milestones in our drive to market leadership. Axcelis had a number of important accomplishments in 2022: Axcelis revenue grew 39 year over year; Our full year revenue, gross margins and operating profit were all at record levels since our first full year as a public company in 2001; The market for mature semiconductor devices grew rapidly, producing greater than 80 of our systems shipments, and within that total, the electrification of the automotive market drove the power device market to contribute approximately 39 of our systems shipments; Our global footprint in growing markets continued to expand, including through multiple evaluations at key customers in memory, mature process technologies and advanced logic, sales of our Purion product extensions into the Silicon Carbide market, follow-on orders for our Purion products in Japan, and device qualification for leading edge CMOS Image Sensor processes; and Rapid growth of our manufacturing capabilities through solid execution, strong supply chain partnerships and bringing online new capacity at both our Beverly, Massachusetts facility and Axcelis Asia Operations Center in South Korea. We continue to work diligently to ensure that manufacturing and operating expense levels remain well aligned to business conditions. 
 22 

The market for our systems and aftermarket products and services is represented by a relatively small number of companies. In 2022, the top 20 semiconductor chip manufacturers accounted for approximately 89.0 of total semiconductor capital equipment spending, down from 92.0 in 2021. Our net revenue from our ten largest customers accounted for 59.4 of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 69.5 and 74.0 of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had two customers representing 13.1 and 11.5 of total revenue, respectively. Critical Accounting Estimates Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon Axcelis consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Management s estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following accounting policies are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For additional accounting policies, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revenue Recognition Our accounting policies relating to the recognition of revenue require management to make estimates, determinations and judgments based on historical experience and on various other assumptions, which include (i) the existence of a contract with the customer, (ii) the identification of the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) the value of any variable consideration in the contract, (iv) the standalone selling price of multiple obligations in the contract, for the purpose of allocating the consideration in the contract, and (v) determining when a performance obligation has been met. Our revenue recognition policies are set forth in section (i) of Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Recognition of revenue based on incorrect judgments, including an erroneous allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting, could result in inappropriate recognition of revenue, or incorrect timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Inventory Provision for Excess and Obsolescence and Lower of Cost or Net Realizable Value We record a provision for estimated excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or net realizable value. The provision is determined using management s assumptions of materials usage, based on estimates of forecasted and historical demand and market conditions. Specifically, our assumptions of forecasted system sales and the size and utilization of the installed base of systems may have a significant effect on estimated materials usage. If actual market conditions become less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts or product demand and pricing assumptions, any significant unanticipated changes in demand, pricing, or technical developments would significantly impact the value of our inventory and our reported operating results. In the future, if we determine that inventory needs to be written down, we will recognize such costs in our cost of revenue at the time of such determination. If we subsequently sell product that has previously been written down, our gross margin in that period will be favorably impacted. Product Warranty We generally offer a one-year warranty for all of our systems, the terms and conditions of which vary depending upon the product sold. For all systems sold, we accrue a liability for the estimated cost of standard warranty at the time of system shipment and defer the portion of systems revenue attributable to the relative fair value of non-standard warranty. 
 23 

Costs for non-standard warranty are expensed as incurred. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units, historical and anticipated product failure rates, material usage and service labor costs. We periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded liability and adjust the amount as necessary. Income Taxes We record income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax basis, and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Our consolidated financial statements contain certain deferred tax assets which have arisen primarily as a result of operating losses, as well as other temporary differences between financial and income tax accounting. We establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against those net deferred tax assets. We evaluate the weight of all available evidence such as historical losses, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and projected future taxable income to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Our income tax expense includes the largest amount of tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. Settlements with tax authorities, the expiration of statutes of limitations for particular tax positions, or obtaining new information on particular tax positions may cause a change to the effective tax rate. We recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and penalties as operating expense.

Results of Operations The following year-to-year comparative statements include the 2022 and 2021 year periods. For comparative statements for 2021 and 2020 periods, please refer to our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 25, 2022. The following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of total revenue: 

Year ended December 31, 2022 2021 Revenue: Product 96.8 95.8 Services 3.2 4.2 Total revenue 100.0 100.0 Cost of revenue: Product 53.5 52.8 Services 2.8 4.0 Total cost of revenue 56.3 56.8 Gross profit 43.7 43.2 Operating expenses: Research and development 8.5 9.9 Sales and marketing 5.8 7.1 General and administrative 6.2 7.0 Total operating expenses 20.5 24.0 Income from operations 23.2 19.2 Other (expense) income: Interest income 0.5 Interest expense (0.6) (0.7) Other, net (0.7) (0.3) Total other expense (0.8) (1.0) Income before income taxes 22.4 18.2 Income tax provision 2.4 3.3 Net income 20.0 14.9 Revenue The following table sets forth our revenue:

 25 

Product Product revenue, which includes new system sales, sales of spare parts, product upgrades and used system sales was 890.6 million or 96.8 of revenue in 2022, compared with 634.4 million or 95.8 of revenue in 2021. The increase in product revenue in 2022 was primarily driven by an increase in the number of Purion systems sold. A portion of our revenue from system sales is deferred until installation and other services related to future deliverables are performed. The total amount of deferred revenue at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 154.8 million and 68.4 million, respectively. The increase was primarily due to increases in system prepayments and the volume of systems sold. Services Services revenue, which includes the labor component of maintenance and service contracts and fees for service hours provided by on-site service personnel, was 29.4 million, or 3.2 of revenue for 2022, compared with 28.0 million, or 4.2 of revenue for 2021. Although services revenue should increase with the expansion of the installed base of systems, it can fluctuate from period to period based on capacity utilization at customers manufacturing facilities, which affects the need for equipment service. Revenue Categories used by Management In addition to the line item revenue categories discussed above, management also uses revenue categorizations which break down revenue into other groupings. Management regularly disaggregates revenue in the following categories, which it finds relevant and useful: Systems and Customer Solutions and Innovation (also known as aftermarket revenue, in which CS I or Aftermarket revenue is A. The portion of Product revenue relating to spare parts, product upgrades and used systems combined with; B. Service revenue, which is the labor component of aftermarket revenues Aftermarket revenue reflects current fab utilization as opposed to System revenue, which reflects capital investment decisions by our customers, which have differing economic drivers; Revenue by geographic regions, since economic factors impacting customer purchasing decisions may vary by geographic region; and Revenue by our customers end markets, since they tend to be subject to different economic environments at different periods of time, impacting a customer s likelihood of purchasing capital equipment during any particular period; currently, management uses three end market categories: Memory, mature process technology and leading edge foundry and logic. The CS I/aftermarket revenue categories for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are discussed below. CS I/Aftermarket Revenue from our aftermarket business was 227.9 million in 2022, compared to 207.8 million for 2021. Aftermarket revenue generally increases with the expansion of the installed base of systems but can fluctuate from period to period based on capacity utilization at customers manufacturing facilities which affects the sale of spare parts and demand for equipment service.

Gross Profit / Gross Margin The following table sets forth our gross profit (dollars in thousands): 

Year ended Period-to-Period December 31, Change 2022 2021 Gross Profit: Product 398,478 284,887 113,591 39.9 Product gross margin 44.7 44.9 Services 3,312 1,558 1,754 112.6 Services gross margin 11.3 5.6 Total gross profit 401,790 286,445 115,345 40.3 Gross margin 43.7 43.2 Product Gross margin from product revenue was 44.7 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, compared to 44.9 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. The slight decrease in gross margin is primarily attributable to changes in the mix of products. Services Gross margin from services revenue was 11.3 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, compared to 5.6 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. The increase in gross margin is attributable to changes in the mix of service contracts. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth our operating expenses: 

Year ended Period-to-Period December 31, Change 2022 2021 Research and development 78,356 65,431 12,925 19.8 Percentage of revenue 8.5 9.9 Sales and marketing 53,599 47,548 6,051 12.7 Percentage of revenue 5.8 7.1 General and administrative 57,474 46,141 11,333 24.6 Percentage of revenue 6.2 7.0 Total operating expenses 189,429 159,120 30,309 19.0 Percentage of revenue 20.5 24.0 Our operating expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, commissions, bonuses, stock-based compensation and related benefits and taxes; project material costs related to the design and development of new products and enhancement of existing products; and professional fees, facilities and amortization and depreciation expenses. Personnel costs are our largest expense, representing 114.8 million, or 60.6 of our total operating expenses, for the year ended December 31, 2022; and 100.3 million, or 63.1 of our total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Research and Development 

Year ended Period-to-Period December 31, Change 2022 2021 Research and development 78,356 65,431 12,925 19.8 Percentage of revenue 8.5 9.9 Our ability to remain competitive depends largely on continuously developing innovative technology, with new and enhanced features and systems and introducing them at competitive prices on a timely basis. Accordingly, based on our strategic plan, we establish annual research and development budgets to fund programs that we expect will drive competitive advantages. Research and development R D expense was 78.4 million in 2022, an increase of 12.9 million, or 19.8 , compared with 65.4 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll related costs due to increased headcount and incentive based pay as well as increased material and supplies expense to support ongoing R D projects. Sales and Marketing 

Year ended Period-to-Period December 31, Change 2022 2021 Sales and marketing 53,599 47,548 6,051 12.7 Percentage of revenue 5.8 7.1 Our sales and marketing expenses result primarily from the sale of our equipment and services through our direct sales force. Sales and marketing expense was 53.6 million in 2022, an increase of 6.1 million, or 12.7 , compared with 47.5 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll related costs due to increased headcount and incentive based pay as well as increased freight and travel expense. General and Administrative 

Year ended Period-to-Period December 31, Change 2022 2021 General and administrative 57,474 46,141 11,333 24.6 Percentage of revenue 6.2 7.0 Our general and administrative expenses result primarily from the costs associated with our executive, finance, information technology, legal and human resource functions. General and administrative expense was 57.5 million in 2022, an increase of 11.3 million, or 24.6 compared with 46.1 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll related costs due to increased headcount and incentive based pay as well as increases in various other expenses to support growth. Other (Expense) Income Other (expense) income consists of interest expense relating to the lease obligation we incurred in connection with the 2015 sale of our headquarters facility sale leaseback and other financing obligations, foreign exchange gains and losses attributable to fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against the local currencies of certain of the countries in which we operate, as well as interest earned on our invested cash balances.

Year ended Period-to-period December 31, change 2022 2021 Other expense (7,476) (6,897) 579 (8.4) Percentage of revenue (0.8) (1.0) Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 7.5 million, which includes 5.0 million of interest expense related to our sale leaseback obligation and 6.4 million of foreign currency translation losses, partially offset by interest income 4.6 million. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 6.9 million, which includes 5.1 million of interest expense related to our sale leaseback obligation and 2.5 million of foreign currency translation loss, slightly offset by other miscellaneous income of 0.3 million, a reversal of interest expense of 0.2 million relating to a tax position for which the statute of limitations expired and interest income of 0.2 million. Income Taxes 

Year ended Period-to-period December 31, change 2022 2021 Income tax provision 21,806 21,778 28 0.1 Percentage of revenue 2.4 3.3 Income tax expense was 21.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 10.6 compared to 18.1 for year the ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2022 is due to Foreign-derived intangible income FDII ), which is taxed at a lower tax rate than the U.S. statutory rate, resulting in a tax benefit of 20.5 million in the current year. The full utilization of the U.S. federal net operating losses allowed us to make use of the FDII in the current year. At December 31, 2022, we had 31.7 million of net deferred tax assets worldwide relating to capitalized research and development costs and other temporary differences, which are available to reduce income taxes in future years. We have recorded a 8.4 million valuation allowance against certain tax credits and state net operating losses due to the uncertainty of their realization. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our liquidity is affected by many factors. Some of these relate specifically to the operations of our business. For example, our sales and other factors are influenced by the uncertainties of global economies, including the availability of credit and the condition of the overall semiconductor capital equipment industry. Our industry requires ongoing investments in operations and research and development that are not easily adjusted to reflect changes in revenue. As a result, profitability and cash flows can fluctuate more widely than revenue. In 2022, 215.6 million of cash was provided by operating activities. This compares to 150.2 million of cash provided by operations in 2021. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022 was 185.6 million, compared to 294.9 million at December 31, 2021. Approximately 47.7 million of cash was located in foreign jurisdictions as of December 31, 2022. In addition to the cash and cash equivalent balance at December 31, 2022, we had 0.8 million in restricted cash which relates to a 0.7 million letter of credit relating to workers compensation insurance and a 0.1 million deposit relating to customs activity. Working capital at December 31, 2022 was 629.5 million. At December 31, 2022, we had no bank debt. In 2022, 257.3 million of cash was used in investing activities. Capital expenditures were 10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. We held 246.6 million of short-term investments at December 31, 2022. These short-term investments consist of U.S. Government securities and agency investments. In 2021, 8.7 million was used in investing activities for capital expenditures. Total capital expenditures for 2023 are projected to be approximately 19.1 million. 
 29 

Future capital expenditures beyond 2023 will depend on a number of factors, including the timing and rate of expansion of our business and our ability to generate cash to fund them. Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 65.5 million, which consisted of 57.5 million related to our stock repurchase program, 9.9 million related to net settlement of restricted stock issuances and 1.0 million related to principal reduction on our financing lease. These amounts were partially offset by 1.2 million in proceeds of stock option exercises and 1.7 million in proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan. Cash used in financing activities was 52.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which consisted of 50.0 million related to our stock repurchase program, 6.6 million related to net settlement of restricted stock issuances, and 0.8 million of principal reduction on our finance lease. These uses of cash were partially offset by 3.7 million in proceeds of stock option exercises and 1.2 million in proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan. We have outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and deposits in the amount of 14.7 million to cover the security deposit under the lease of our headquarters, our workers compensation insurance program, customs and bank deposits and certain value added tax claims in Europe.

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2022, other than leases signed but not commenced. See Note 18 Income Taxes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to our unrecognized tax benefits. We consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022, to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon. As of December 31, 2022, the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately 15.3 million. We have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with any domestic debt service requirements. Upon repatriation of those earnings, in the form of dividends or otherwise, we could be subject to withholding taxes payable to the various foreign tax jurisdictions. Under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), we qualify as a well-known seasoned issuer, which allows us to file shelf registration statements to register an unspecified amount of securities that are effective upon filing. On May 29, 2020, we filed such a shelf registration statement with the SEC for the issuance of an unspecified amount of common stock, preferred stock, various series of debt securities and/or warrants to purchase any of such securities, either individually or in units, from time to time at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of any such offering. This registration statement was effective upon filing and will expire in May 2023. We may file another shelf registration statement to maintain the availability of this financing option.

On July 31, 2020, we entered into a Senior Secured Credit Facilities Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 40.0 million. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a security interest, senior to any current and future debts and to any security interest, in all of our rights, title, and interest in, to and under substantially all of our assets, subject to limited exceptions, including permitted liens. The revolving credit facility terminates on July 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenant requirements of the Credit Agreement. As of such date, no borrowings had been made under the Credit Agreement, although a letter of credit for 5.9 million reduces the funds available for borrowing under the credit line. We have no immediate plans to borrow under the Credit Agreement, but we will use the facility for letters of credit, for ongoing working capital needs and to fund general corporate purposes, as desired. We entered into a First Amendment to the Credit Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank in March 2021 to (i) align the covenants with our 2021 stock repurchase program, and (ii) establish terms to transition from a Eurodollar based interest rate option to an interest rate benchmark using a secured overnight financing rate (known as SOFR published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. We believe that based on our current market, revenue, expense and cash flow forecasts, our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and borrowing capacity will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the short and long-term. Related-Party Transactions There are no significant related-party transactions that require disclosure in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, or in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Recent Accounting Pronouncements A discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, the impact of some of which may be material, is included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Interest Rate Sensitivity Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio, which consists of cash equivalents and short-term investments at December 31, 2022. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal. This is accomplished by investing in marketable investment grade securities. We do not use derivative financial instruments in managing our investment portfolio. Due to the nature of our investments, we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by any change in market interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Substantially all of our sales are billed in U.S. dollars, thereby reducing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on our results. Operating margins of certain foreign operations can fluctuate with changes in foreign exchange rates to the extent revenue is billed in U.S. dollars and operating expenses are incurred in the local currency. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 9.1 and 21.6 of our revenue, respectively, were derived in local currencies from foreign operations with this inherent risk. In addition, at both December 31, 2022 and 2021, our operations outside of the United States accounted for approximately 10.2 and 12.6 of our total assets, respectively, the majority of which was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We currently do not use derivative financial instruments in managing our foreign currency exchange risk. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report (the Evaluation Date ). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO Internal Control 2013 Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. The independent registered public accounting firm of Ernst Young LLP, as auditors of our consolidated financial statements, has issued an attestation report on its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Axcelis Technologies, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Axcelis Technologies, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Systems Revenue recognition Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 2 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company generates revenue from the sale of ion implantation and other processing equipment used in the manufacture of semiconductor chips systems revenue ). The Company s revenue contracts for systems have multiple performance obligations, including the systems themselves and obligations that are not delivered simultaneously with the systems. Systems revenue accounted for 692.1 million of the Company s total revenue of 920.0 million in 2022. Auditing the Company s determination of the distinct performance obligations related to its systems revenue contracts involved extensive audit effort to identify all of the promised products and services in an arrangement and assess distinct performance obligations. These determinations have a significant 
 37 

effect on the pattern of revenue recognition. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s systems revenue recognition process. For example, we tested management s controls over the identification of distinct performance obligations in systems revenue contracts. To test systems revenue recognition, our procedures included, among others, independently identifying promises and determining the interdependence of the performance obligations. For example, we selected and read a sample of arrangements to evaluate the completeness of the promised products and services. We also confirmed directly with certain of the Company s customers the terms of the selected system revenue arrangement. Estimate of Excess Inventory Description of the Matter The Company s inventories totaled 242.4 million, net, as of December 31, 2022. As described in Note 2 and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records a provision for estimated excess inventory. Management determines the provision using its assumptions of future materials usage, based on estimates of demand and market conditions. Auditing the Company s provision for excess inventory is complex due to the highly judgmental nature of the factors used to estimate demand and market conditions. Specifically, the Company s estimated materials usage may be significantly affected by management s assumptions of forecasted system sales and the size and utilization of the installed base of systems. Management s identification and measurement of these factors are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions that could have a significant effect on the excess inventory reserve. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls, including management review controls, over the Company s excess inventory reserve estimation process. This included management s assessment of the assumptions and data underlying the excess inventory provision. For example, we tested controls over management s review of its systems sales forecasts, as well as management s review of the assumptions relating to the market size and utilization of installed systems. We also tested management s controls over the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the estimation model. Our substantive audit procedures included evaluating the significant assumptions stated above and testing the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used by management to compute the value of excess inventory. For example, we compared the quantities of on-hand inventories to historical and forecasted materials usage and evaluated adjustments to forecasts for specific product considerations, such as technological changes or alternative uses. We also assessed the historical accuracy of management s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses over the significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the excess inventory estimates that would result from changes in the underlying assumptions. /s/ We have served as the Company s auditor since 1999.

We retained the historical costs of the property and the related accumulated depreciation on our financial books within property, plant and equipment and will continue to depreciate the property for financial reporting purposes over the lesser of its remaining useful life or its initial lease term of 22 years . Depreciation and amortization are recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows: to Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Expenditures greater than thousand for renewals and betterments are capitalized and depreciated over their useful lives. t record an impairment charge in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, or 2020. Actual performance could be materially different from our current forecasts, which could impact estimates of undiscounted cash flows and may result in the impairment of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets in the future. This could be caused by strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on our customer base, or a material adverse change in our relationships with significant customers.

after acceptance of the tool. For aftermarket transactions, we provide customers an assurance-type warranty for . Customers can choose to purchase extended warranty terms with enhanced support similar to a service-type warranty ranging from one to . In accordance with ASC 606, assurance-type warranties are not considered a performance obligation, whereas service-type warranties are. 3) Determine the transaction price The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely amount method depending on the nature of the variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Any estimates, including the effect of the constraint on variable consideration, are evaluated at each reporting period for any changes. In applying this guidance, Companies must also consider whether any significant financing components exist. The transaction price for all transactions is based on the price reflected in the individual customer s purchase order. Variable consideration has not been identified as a significant component of the transaction price for any of our transactions. For those transactions where all performance obligations will be satisfied within one year or less, we apply the practical expedient outlined in ASC 606-10-32-18. This practical expedient allows us not to adjust promised consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if we expect at contract inception that the period between when we transfer the promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. For those transactions that are expected to be completed after one year, we have assessed that there are no significant financing components because any difference between the promised consideration and the cash selling price of the good or service is for reasons other than the provision of financing. 4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis unless the transaction price is variable and meets the criteria to be allocated entirely to a performance obligation or to a distinct service that forms part of a single performance obligation. Where required, we determine standalone selling price SSP for each obligation based on consideration of both market and Company specific factors, including the selling price and profit margin for similar products, the cost to produce, and the anticipated margin. For those contracts that contain multiple performance obligations (primarily systems sales, as well as some aftermarket contracts requiring both time and material inputs), we must determine the SSP. We use a cost plus margin

Aftermarket Total Revenue (b) Economic Factors Affecting our Revenue: Geographic Breakdown of Revenue Global economic conditions have a direct impact on our revenue. We are substantially dependent on sales of our products and services to customers outside of the United States. Adverse economic conditions, political instability, potential adverse tax consequences, regulatory changes and volatility in exchange rates pose a risk that our clients may reduce, postpone or cancel spending for our products and services, which would impact our revenue. Revenue by geographic markets is determined based upon the location to which our products are shipped and where our services are performed.

million. This represents the portion of the transaction price for contracts with customers allocated to the performance obligations that remain unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied. Short-term deferred revenue of million as of December 31, 2022 represents performance obligations that are expected to be satisfied within the next 12 months. This amount relates primarily to prepayments made prior to system delivery as well as to installation and non-standard warranty performance obligations for system sales. Long-term deferred revenue of million as of December 31, 2022 relates to prepayments made prior to system delivery as well as to extended warranty performance obligations that we expect to be completed in excess of the next 12 months but within the next . The majority of our system transactions have payment terms that are due upon shipment of the tool and due upon installation. Aftermarket transaction payment terms are such that payment is due either within or of service provided or delivery of parts.

The components of accounts receivable are as follows: Allowance for doubtful accounts Trade receivables, net Work in process Finished goods (completed systems) Inventories, net When recorded, inventory reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of inventories to their net realizable value. We establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that indicate inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon assumptions about future demand for our products or market conditions. We regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of inventories based on a combination of factors including the following: forecasted sales and the size and utilization of our installed base, estimated product end of life dates, estimated current and future market value and new product introductions. Purchasing and usage alternatives are also explored to mitigate inventory exposure. In 2022, we recorded an increase of million in inventory reserves. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, inventories are stated net of inventory reserves of million and million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded charges to cost of sales of million, million and million, respectively, to adjust inventories to their lower of cost or net realizable value.

The associated lease payments include both an interest component and payment of principal, with the underlying liability being extinguished at the end of the original lease term. We posted a collateralized security deposit of million in the form of an irrevocable letter of credit at the time of the closing. This letter of credit is currently issued under the credit facility described in the next paragraph. On July 31, 2020, we entered into a Senior Secured Credit Facilities Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, in its capacity as administrative agent and collateral agent for itself and as a lender, and such other banks and financial institutions or entities that from time to time join as lenders under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed million.

million shares of common stock, par value, for grant and permits the issuance of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock equivalents and awards of shares of common stock that are not subject to restrictions or forfeiture to selected employees, directors and consultants of the Company. The total number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan is the sum of million shares approved by the shareholders, and million shares added in accordance with the terms of the Plan as a result of the expiration or forfeiture of awards granted under our prior equity plan. Shares that are not issued under an award (because such award expires, is terminated unexercised or is forfeited) revert back to the Plan. The term of stock options granted under the Plan is specified in the award agreements. Unless a lesser term is otherwise specified by the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors, awards under the 2012 Equity Plan will expire from the date of grant. Under the terms of the Plan, the exercise price of a stock option may not be less than the fair market value of a share of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. Under the 2012 Equity Plan, fair market value is defined as the last reported sale price of a share of the Company s common stock on a national securities exchange as of any applicable date, as long as the Company s shares are traded on such exchange. Stock options granted to employees generally vest over a period of , while stock options granted to non-employee members of the Company s Board of Directors generally vest over a period of and, once vested, are not affected by the director s termination of service to the Company. In limited circumstances, the Company may grant stock option awards with market-based vesting conditions, such as the Company s common stock price, or other performance conditions. Termination of service by an employee will cause options to cease vesting as of the date of termination, and in most cases, employees will have after termination to exercise options that were vested as of the termination of employment. In general, retiring employees will have after termination of employment to exercise vested options. The Company settles stock option exercises with newly issued common shares. Restricted stock units granted to employees during 2022 had both service-based vesting provisions and performance-based vesting provisions. Restricted stock units granted to employees generally vest over a service period of , while restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Company s Board of Directors in 2022 vest over a service period of . We have granted restricted stock units to executive officers and other senior employees with performance vesting conditions, which may be subject to further service-based vesting terms. Unvested restricted stock unit awards expire upon termination of service to the Company. We settle restricted stock units upon vesting with newly issued common shares. restricted stock was granted during the three year period ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, there were million shares available for grant under the 2012 Equity Plan.

(b) Employee Stock Purchase Plan The 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the 2020 ESPP provides effectively all of our employees the opportunity to purchase common stock of the Company at less than market prices. Purchases are made through payroll deductions of up to of the employee s salary as elected by the participant, subject to certain caps set forth in the 2020 ESPP. Employees may purchase the Company s common stock at of its market price on the day the stock is purchased. The 2020 ESPP is considered compensatory and as such, compensation expense has been recognized based on the benefit of the discounted stock price, amortized to compensation expense over each offering period of .

million and million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Compensation expense under the 2020 ESPP and our prior employee stock purchase plan (the 2000 ESPP was approximately million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2022, there were approximately million shares reserved for issuance and available for purchase under the 2020 ESPP, with shares purchased on that date to be issued pending settlement. Less than million shares were purchased under the 2020 ESPP for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The 2000 ESPP expired in June 2020. Less than million shares were purchased under the 2020 ESPP and 2000 ESPP for the year ended December 31, 2020. (c) Valuation of Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units For the purpose of valuing stock options with service conditions, we use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the grant-date fair value of an award. Weighted-average expected term years Risk-free interest rate Expected dividend yield There were stock option awards granted in 2022 and 2020. The fair value of the Company s restricted stock units is calculated based upon the fair market value of the Company s stock at the date of grant. (d) Summary of Stock-based Compensation Expense We use the straight-line attribution method to recognize expense for stock-based awards such that the expense associated with awards is evenly recognized throughout the period. The amount of stock-based compensation recognized is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise them, if necessary, in subsequent periods, if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered stock-based award. Based on a historical analysis, a forfeiture rate of per year was applied to stock-based awards, including executive officer awards, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized stock-based compensation expense of million, million and million, respectively. We present the expenses related to stock-based compensation in the same expense line items as cash compensation paid to our employees. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we used restricted stock units in our annual equity compensation program. The benefit of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost is reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows as part of cash flows from operating activities. Axcelis had tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost of million for the year ended December 31, 2022 which resulted in a tax benefit of million.

Our deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when these temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. At December 31, 2022, we had million of net deferred tax assets worldwide relating to capitalized R D costs and other temporary differences, which are available to reduce income taxes in future years. The decrease in our deferred tax assets from the prior year was primarily due to the utilization of our net operating losses, resulting in a decrease in deferred tax assets of million, partially offset by a million increase relating to capitalized R D costs. At December 31, 2022, we maintained a million valuation allowance in the U.S. against certain tax credits and state net operating losses due to the uncertainty of their realization based on long-term Company forecasts and the expiration dates on these attributes. This represents an increase of million from the prior year. At December 31, 2022, we had state net operating loss carryforwards of million. State net operating losses will expire between 2023 and 2034. At December 31, 2022, we have foreign net operating loss carryforwards of million. The majority of our foreign net operating losses have an unlimited carryforward period. At December 31, 2022, we had research and development and other tax credit carryforwards of million. These carry forwards are subject to an uncertain tax position reserve of million. These credits can be used to reduce future federal and state income tax liabilities and expire principally between 2023 and 2035. A provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA took effect in 2022, creating a significant change to our treatment of research and experimental expenditures. Historically, businesses had the option of deducting R D expenses in the year incurred or capitalizing and amortizing the costs over five years. The new TCJA provision eliminates this option and requires R D expenses associated with research conducted in the U.S. to be capitalized and amortized over a five-year period. For expenses associated with research outside of the United States, R D expenses are capitalized and amortized over a 15-year period. The Company has included the tax impact of capitalizing and amortizing these costs over the required periods in their tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2022.

million. We have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements. We and our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states and foreign jurisdictions. We and most foreign subsidiaries are subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for all years dating back to 2009. Our policy is to recognize interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and penalties as operating expenses. We believe that we have appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on our tax returns and that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter. At December 31, 2022, we had unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions of million, million of which is recorded as a long-term liability, and the remainder of which reduced the Company s state deferred tax assets and the offsetting valuation allowance. We recognized million in interest and penalty expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 relating to these uncertain tax positions. These unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate and also reverse associated accrued interest and penalty expenses. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits are as follows: Decrease in unrecognized tax benefits as a result of tax positions taken during a prior period ) ) ) Decreases in unrecognized tax benefits related to settlements with tax authorities ) Reductions to unrecognized tax benefits as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitation ) Increases in unrecognized tax benefits as a result of tax positions taken during the current period Balance at end of year Recorded as other long-term liability Recorded as a decrease in deferred tax assets Balance at end of year

Excess Compensation means the difference between the amount of Performance-based Compensation received by the executive officer and the amount of any such Performance-based Compensation that would have been received by the executive officer if such Performance-based Compensation had been calculated based on the corrected financial information included in a Triggering Restatement. In the case of equity awards, Excess Compensation shall exist only to the extent that the erroneous data causing the Triggering Restatement was a factor in the Company s determination of the size, vesting or other terms of the equity grant. Executive officer has the meaning given to that term in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as designated by the Board at the time the Performance-based Compensation is paid or received by the individual. Performance-based Compensation means all cash incentive compensation received by an executive officer and equity awards granted by the Company as a portion of the executive officer s compensation, other than equity awards in lieu of base pay. Triggering Restatement shall mean a restatement of the Company s financial information required to be reported under the federal securities laws as a result of erroneous data which caused a material non-compliance by the Company with a financial reporting requirement under the federal securities laws.

The time of receipt shall be (A) the time of payment of the cash Performance-based Compensation and (B) the time of grant of any equity Performance-based Compensation,

Equity awards granted during the period, as well as profits received on exercise or sale of equity awards during the period, will be deemed to be Performance-based Compensation received during the period. 
 In determining the after-tax portion of the amount of compensation to be claimed for clawback, the Board shall take into account its good faith estimate of the value of any tax deduction available to the executive officer in respect of such repayment. In addition to the foregoing, this policy shall be deemed to encompass any clawback policy or right required or permissible under (i) Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (ii) Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or any law of similar effect for recovery of incentive-based compensation previously paid, and (iii) any regulations promulgated pursuant to any such laws. Clawback Process Clawback Demand Notice .

Hearing. The Clawback Demand Notice shall offer the executive officer the opportunity to be heard, at a meeting of the Board (which may be in-person or telephonic, as determined by the Board). Following such meeting (or if the executive officer does not accept the offer to be heard within 10 business days following the clawback demand notice), the Board will send a second notice to the executive officer confirming or modifying its clawback demand (the Final Notice ). Payment . The Final Notice shall specify the method(s) of repayment to be used, including:

 If the Company is unable to achieve repayment as requested by the Final Notice, then, on Board authorization, the Company may seek a court order against the affected individual for such repayment. Board s Right to Delay or Decline to Seek Recovery The Board may delay seeking recovery or determine not to seek recovery if the Board reasonably determines that it would not be in the best interests of the stockholders of the Company to do so. In making such determination, the Board shall take into account such considerations as it deems appropriate, including, without limitation: 
 the immateriality of the amount involved; In the case of triggers 2 and 3 above, the lack of harm, or minimal level of harm, to the Company from the violation or competition; the likelihood of success under governing law versus the cost and effort involved and any counter-claims which might be asserted against the Company; whether the assertion of a claim may prejudice the interests of the Company, including the Company s business interests with respect to customers, suppliers, or in any other proceeding or investigation; and/or the unresolved nature of any facts on which a claim would be based.
