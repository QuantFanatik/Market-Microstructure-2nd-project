The Securities and Exchange Commission SEC generally defines penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.

 Forward-Looking Statements 
 Statements about our future expectations are forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable Federal Securities Laws, and are not guarantees of future performance. When used herein, the words may, will, should, anticipate, believe, appear, intend, plan, expect, estimate, approximate, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks and uncertainties inherent in our business, including those set forth under the caption Risk Factors in other filings with the SEC, and are subject to change at any time. Our actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement. 
 Overview 
 The Company was founded as an integrated health and wellness biotechnology company with a plan to develop and /or acquire a network of wellness centers worldwide that would be primarily focused on the homeopathic and alternative treatment of late stage cancer. 
 To date we have been unable to initiate our original business plan. While we are continuing to seek opportunities to do so, we are also seeking other opportunities to integrate assets, rights, or other potential revenue streams. 
 Plan of Operation 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs, professional fees, business insurance, rent, general legal activities, and other corporate expenses. 
 We have never been profitable and do not anticipate having net income unless and until we develop and/or acquire our wellness centers and/or develop new channels of distribution. With respect to our current activities, this is not likely to occur until we obtain significant additional funding. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability on a sustained basis, if at all, obtain the required funding, obtain, or complete additional corporate partnering or acquisition transactions. 
 Accordingly, we will need to raise additional funds or pursue strategic transactions or other strategic alternatives. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of our equity securities, and we expect to continue obtaining required capital in a similar manner. 
 Results of Operations 
 The Company had no revenues and no cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 
 The Company incurred operating expenses of 141,035 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 145,718 in 2021. The decrease in expenses in 2022 was primarily a result of a 3,400 decrease of accounting expenses. We do not believe these costs are indicative of future years, and we cannot at this time predict our costs if and when we begin earning revenues and exit the start-up stage. 
 The Company had a net loss of 145,074 for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to a net loss of 148,360 in 2021. This is primarily a result of the reduction in accounting expenses during 2022. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our capital requirements are principally related to our efforts to implement our business plan. Our cash balance as of December 31, 2022 was 190.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Director of 
 HST Global, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of HST Global, Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit and cash flows for the each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position for the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has yet to establish an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatements, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

 ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES 
 None. 
 
 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 Our management, including our Principal Executive and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2022. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2022 for the reasons discussed below. 
 (b) Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-a5(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use of disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022 and there are material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 The material weaknesses relate to the limited number of persons responsible for the recording and reporting of financial information, the lack of separation of financial reporting duties, and the limited size of our management team in general. We are in the process evaluating methods of improving our internal control over financial reporting, 
 Page 18 
 
 including the possible addition of financial reporting staff and the increased separation of financial reporting responsibility, and intend to implement such steps as are necessary and possible to correct these material weaknesses. 
 (c) Change in Internal Controls 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Section 16(A) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
 Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act requires our directors and officers, and persons who own more than ten percent of the Common Stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and the American Stock Exchange. SEC regulations require reporting persons to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 
 Based solely on our review of the copies of the Forms 3, 4 and 5 and amendments thereto furnished to us by the persons required to make such filings during fiscal 2022 and our own records, we believe that no director or officer failed to file timely any beneficial ownership report. 
 Corporate Governance. 
 We have not adopted a code of ethics to date. We are in the process of evaluating the standards of conduct necessary for the deterrence of malfeasance and the promotion of ethical conduct and accountability, and will determine whether a code of ethics is necessary based on our evaluation. 
 The Company does not have a standing Nominating Committee. There have been no changes to the procedures whereby security holders may recommend nominees to the registrant's board of directors. 
 The Company is not a listed issuer as defined by Rule 10A-3, and does not have a standing Audit Committee. We do not have a financial expert serving on our board of directors. 
 ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
 Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
 We do not have a standing compensation committee. Our board of directors as a whole makes the decisions as to employee benefit programs and officer and employee compensation. The primary objectives of our executive compensation programs are to: 
 - attract, retain and motivate skilled and knowledgeable individuals; 
 - ensure that compensation is aligned with our corporate strategies and business objectives; 
 - promote the achievement of key strategic and financial performance measures by linking short-term and long-term cash and equity incentives to the achievement of measurable corporate and individual performance goals; and 
 - align executives' incentives with the creation of stockholder value. 
 To achieve these objectives, our board of directors evaluates our executive compensation program with the objective of setting compensation at levels they believe will allow us to attract and retain qualified executives. In addition, a portion of each executive's overall compensation is tied to key strategic, financial and operational goals set by our board of directors. We also generally provide a portion of our executive compensation in the form of options that vest over time, which we believe helps us retain our executives and align their interests with those of our stockholders by allowing the executives to participate in our longer term success as reflected in asset growth and stock price appreciation. 
 Page 21 
 
 Named Executive Officers 
 The following table identifies our principal executive officer, our principal financial officer and our most highly paid executive officers, who, for purposes of this Compensation Disclosure and Analysis only, are referred to herein as the named executive officers.

 Corporate Office 
 
 Ron Howell 
 
 Chief Executive Officer and 
 Interim Chief Financial Officer 

Components of our Executive Compensation Program 
 The primary elements of our executive compensation program will be base salaries and option grant incentive awards, although the board of directors has the authority to award cash bonuses, benefits and other forms of compensation as it sees fit. 
 The Company has entered into a consulting agreement with Mr. Howell whereby the Company agreed to pay Mr. Howell 10,000 per month. Mr. Howell did not accrue these consulting fees from July, 2019 through December, 2019 due to the pendency of the APA with Orbital; however, Mr. Howell resumed accruing these consulting fees after termination of the APA in January, 2020. The Company intends to continue to engage Mr. Howell as a consultant until his consulting services are no longer required. 
 We do not have any formal or informal policy or target for allocating compensation between short-term and long-term compensation, between cash and non-cash compensation or among the different forms of non-cash compensation. Instead, we have determined subjectively on a case-by-case basis the appropriate level and mix of the various compensation components. Similarly, we do not rely on benchmarking against our competitors in making compensation-related decisions. 
 Base salaries Base salaries will be used to recognize the experience, skills, knowledge and responsibilities required of our named executive officers. Base salary, and other components of compensation, may be evaluated by our board of directors for adjustment based on an assessment of the individual's performance and compensation trends in our industry. 
 Equity Awards Our stock option award program will be the primary vehicle for offering long-term incentives to our executives. To date, we have not issued any equity awards. We intend our equity awards to executives to generally be made in the form of warrants. We believe that equity grants in the form of warrants provide our executives with a direct link to our long-term performance, create an ownership culture, and align the interests of our executives and our stockholders. 
 Cash bonuses Our board of directors has the discretion to award cash bonuses based on our financial performance and individual objectives. The corporate financial performance measures (revenues and profits) will be given the greatest weight in this bonus analysis. We have not yet granted any cash bonuses to any named executive officer nor have we yet developed any specific individual objectives while we wait to attain revenue and profitability levels sufficient to undertake any such bonuses. 
 Benefits and other compensation Our named executive officers are permitted to participate in such health care, disability insurance, bonus and other employee benefits plans as may be in effect with the Company from time to time to the extent the executive is eligible under the terms of those plans. As of the date of this Registration Statement, with exception to health care, we have not implemented any such employee benefit plans. 
 Page 22 
 
 Description of Compensation Agreements and Arrangements 
 As discussed below, we have not agreed to pay the Named Executive Officer an annual salary. We will negotiate a base salary in the near future, and such base salary may be increased from time to time with the approval of the board of directors. The following table summarizes the agreed annual salary of each of the named executive officers:

 Ron Howell, Chief Executive Officer Mr. Howell currently does not receive compensation for his services as Chief Executive Officer. He has agreed to defer compensation until the Company obtains sufficient financing. The Board of Directors will determine what level of compensation is appropriate to offer Mr. Howell in the near future. 
 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table for Fiscal Year 2022 
 The Company currently does not participate in any equity award plan. During fiscal 2022, we did not grant any equity awards under any equity award plan. 
 Option Exercises for Fiscal 2022 
 During fiscal 2022, none of the named executive officers exercised options. 
 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation 
 To date, we currently offer no defined contribution or other plan that provides for the deferral of compensation on a basis that is not tax-qualified to any of our employees, including the named executive officers. 
 Compensation of Directors 
 We intend to use a combination of cash and equity-based compensation to attract and retain candidates to serve on our board of directors. We intend to compensate directors who are also our employees for their service on our board of directors. Therefore, Mr. Howell will receive compensation for his service on our board of directors, which compensation has not yet been determined. 
 Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
 We do not currently have a standing Compensation Committee. Our entire board of directors participated in deliberations concerning executive officer compensation. 
 Compensation Committee Report 
 The board of directors has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management and, based on such review and discussions, the board of directors has recommended that this Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
