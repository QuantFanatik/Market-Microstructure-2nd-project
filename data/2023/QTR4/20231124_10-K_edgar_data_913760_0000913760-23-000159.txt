 PART I 
 
 Item 1. Business 
 Overview of Business and Strategy 
 We operate a global financial services network that connects companies, organizations, traders and investors to the global market ecosystem through a unique blend of digital platforms, end-to-end clearing and execution services, high touch service and deep expertise. We strive to be the one trusted partner to our clients, providing our network, product and services to allow them to pursue trading opportunities, manage their market risks, make investments and improve their business performance. Our businesses are supported by our global infrastructure of regulated operating subsidiaries, our advanced technology platforms and our team of more than 4,000 employees as of September 30, 2023. We believe our client-first approach differentiates us from large banking institutions, engenders trust and has enabled us to establish market leading positions in a number of complex fields in financial markets around the world. 
 We offer a vertically integrated product suite, beginning with high-touch and electronic access to nearly all major financial markets worldwide, as well as numerous liquidity venues. We deliver this access through the entire lifecycle of a trade, from deep market expertise and on-the-ground intelligence to best execution and finally post-trade clearing, custody and settlement services. We believe this is a unique product offering outside of the bulge bracket banks, which creates long-term relationships with our clients. Our business model has created a revenue stream that is diversified by asset class, client type and geography, earning commissions and spreads as clients execute transactions across our global network, monetizing non-trading client activity including interest and fee earnings on client balances as well as earning consulting and fees for our market intelligence and risk management services. 
 We currently serve more than 54,000 commercial, institutional, and global payments clients, and over 400,000 retail accounts located in more than 180 countries. Our clients include commercial entities, regional, national and introducing broker-dealers, asset managers, insurance companies, brokers, institutional and individual investors, professional traders, commercial and investment banks as well as government and non-governmental organizations NGOs ). We believe our clients value us for our attention to their needs, our expertise and flexibility, our global reach, our ability to provide access to liquidity in hard-to-reach markets and opportunities, and our status as a well-capitalized and regulatory-compliant organization. 
 We engage in direct sales efforts to seek new clients, with a strategy of extending our services to potential clients that are similar in size and operations to our existing client base. In executing this strategy, we intend to both target new geographic locations and expand the services offered in geographic locations in which we currently operate in an effort to increase our market share or where there is an unmet demand for our services. Through our web and mobile sites, including StoneX.com, StoneXOne.com, FOREX.com, and Cityindex.com we seek to attract and onboard new clients generated from digital marketing and brand advertising initiatives. We also pursue new clients through indirect channels, including our StoneX Marketing Partners affiliate program, StoneX.com/marketing partnerships; our relationships with introducing brokers, who solicit clients on our behalf; and white label partners, who offer our services to their clients under their own brand. In addition, we selectively pursue small- to medium-sized acquisitions, focusing primarily on targets that satisfy specified criteria, including client-centric organizations that may help us expand into new asset classes, client segments and geographies where we currently have a small or limited market presence. 
 We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on key trends impacting the financial services sector. Among others, these trends include the impact of increased regulation on banking institutions and other financial services providers; increased consolidation, especially of smaller sub-scale financial services providers and independent securities clearing firms; the growing importance and complexity of conducting secure cross-border transactions; and the demand among financial institutions to transact with well-capitalized counterparties.

 We focus on mitigating exposure to market risk, ensuring adequate liquidity to maintain our daily operations and making non-interest expenses variable, to the greatest extent possible. Our strategy is to utilize a centralized and disciplined process for capital allocation, risk management and cost control, while delegating the execution of strategic objectives and day-to-day management to experienced individuals. This requires high quality managers, a clear communication of performance objectives and strong financial and compliance controls. We believe this strategy will enable us to build a more scalable and significantly larger organization that embraces an entrepreneurial approach to business, supported and underpinned by strong centralized financial and compliance controls.

 Advisory Services 
 We provide value-added advisory services and high-touch trade execution across a variety of financial markets, including commodities, foreign currencies, interest rates, institutional asset management and independent wealth management. For commercial clients with exposure to commodities, foreign currencies and interest rates, we work through our proprietary Integrated Risk Management Program IRMP to systematically identify and quantify their risks and then develop strategic plans to effectively manage these risks with a view to protecting their margins and ultimately improving their bottom lines. 
 We also participate in the underwriting and trading of agency mortgage-backed, commercial mortgage-backed, asset-backed and municipal securities as well as structured credit in domestic and international markets. Through our asset management activities, we leverage our specialist expertise in niche markets to provide institutional investors with tailored investment products. Through our independent wealth management business, we provide advisory services to the growing retail investor market. 
 Market Intelligence 
 Our Market Intelligence platform provides our clients with access to deep data and incisive commentary from our expert traders and analysts from across our global network. This platform focuses on providing local, actionable insights and detailed intelligence from every market we trade, through the lens of our professionals, who leverage first-hand knowledge and personal connections to deliver a unique advantage for our clients. 
 Physical Trading 
 We act as a principal to support the needs of our clients in a variety of physical commodities, primarily precious metals, as well as across the commodity complex, including energy and renewable fuels, grains, oil seeds, cotton, coffee, cocoa, edible oils and feed products. Through these activities, we have the ability to offer a simplified risk management approach to our commercial clients by embedding more complex hedging structures as part of each physical contract to provide clients with enhanced price risk mitigation. We also offer clients efficient off-take or supply services, as well as logistics management. 
 Operating Segments 
 Our business activities are managed through four operating segments, including Commercial, Institutional, Retail, and Global Payments, as follows: 
 Commercial 
 The Commercial segment comprises the activities associated with the identification, management, hedging and monitoring of various commodity and financial risks faced by commercial entities in their business cycles, including risks related to interest rates, foreign exchange, agricultural commodities, energy and renewable fuels, industrial metals, precious metals, and other physical commodities. 
 We offer our commercial clients a comprehensive array of products and services, including risk management and hedging services, execution and clearing of exchange-traded and OTC products, voice brokerage, market intelligence and physical trading as well as commodity financing and logistics services. We believe our ability to provide these high-value-added products and services, differentiates us from our competitors and maximizes the opportunity to retain our clients. 
 Our risk management consulting services are designed to quantify and monitor commercial entities exposure to commodity and financial risk. Upon assessing this exposure, we develop a plan to control and hedge these risks with post-trade reporting against specific client objectives. Our clients are assisted in the execution of their hedging strategies through a wide range of products from listed exchange-traded futures and options to basic OTC instruments that offer greater flexibility, to structured OTC products designed for customized solutions and physical contracts. 
 Our execution and clearing services span virtually all traded commodity markets, with the largest concentrations in agricultural and energy commodities (consisting primarily of grains, energy and renewable fuels, coffee, sugar, cotton, and food service), as well as precious and base metals products. We also provide execution of foreign currency forwards and options and interest rate swaps as well as a wide range of structured product solutions to our commercial clients who are seeking cost-effective hedging strategies. Generally, our clients direct their own trading activity, and our risk management consultants do not have discretionary authority to transact trades on behalf of our clients. 
 We provide a full range of physical trading capabilities in precious metals markets providing our clients the ability to purchase physical gold and other precious metals, in multiple forms, and in denominations of their choice. In our precious metals activities, we act as a principal, committing our own capital to buy and sell precious metals on a spot and forward basis. 
 In addition, we act as a principal to facilitate financing, structured pricing and logistics services to clients across the commodity complex, including energy and renewable fuels, grains, oil seeds, cotton, coffee, cocoa, edible oils and feed products. We provide financing to commercial commodity-related companies against physical inventories.

 We generally mitigate the price risk associated with commodities held in inventory through the use of derivatives. We do not elect hedge accounting under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP in accounting for this price risk mitigation. 
 Within this segment we organize our marketing efforts into client industry product lines including agricultural, energy and renewable fuels, metals and various other commodities, servicing commercial producers, end users and intermediaries around the world. 
 Competitive Environment - Commercial Segment 
 Industry participants include producers/end-users, wholesalers and merchants, corporations, introducing brokers, grain elevators, merchandisers, importer/exporter and market intermediaries such as FCMs and swaps dealers, and liquidity venues such as commodity exchanges, financial exchanges and OTC markets. Commercial entities face a variety of risks, including risks related to commodity input pricing, supply chain management and inventory financing, interest rate changes, exchange rate changes, and price and quantity volatility in their outputs. Market intermediaries facilitate the identification, management and hedging of commodity and financial risks on behalf of commercial entities by designing and executing hedging programs through the use of various hedging instruments, including futures and options traded on exchanges or plain vanilla and more complex structured products traded bi-laterally on the OTC markets. Commercial entities occasionally prefer to manage exposure to physical commodities through direct purchase and sale agreements for which they may utilize the services of physical commodity merchants. 
 The need for, and volume of, client hedging activity is driven by commodity supply and demand dynamics, quantity and quality of commodity production and consumption, both locally and globally, trading of various commodities, and economic and geopolitical factors. In addition, the price levels and price volatility of various commodities generally increase the need of commercial clients to hedge. FCMs, swaps dealers, physical commodity merchants and other intermediaries and service providers create value for commercial clients by managing risks across the clients operations, allowing them to focus on their core expertise. In addition, commercial clients often face financial risks such as interest rate and exchange rate volatility, which these intermediaries help to mitigate. Physical commodity merchants serve clients by providing trading, hedging, inventory financing and logistics services. 
 Competitors in the Commercial segment include independent (non-bank) FCMs, FCMs affiliated with large commodity producers, global banks and independent and bank-owned swaps dealers. Although global banks represent the vast majority of client segregated assets, they tend to focus on larger clients. Independent, non-bank FCMs tend to focus on serving small- to mid-sized commercial clients where they face less competition from the global banks. Over the last 14 years since the financial crisis, global banks have increased the minimum size of clients they are willing to serve, in part due to decreasing profit margins often driven by regulation, such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States and the revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive MiFID II and accompanying regulation, Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation MiFIR in Europe. This has presented an opportunity for non-bank participants in this industry, such as us, to acquire small and mid-sized clients and increase market share. 
 We strive to increase market share and attract new clients that are underserved by the global banks, capitalizing on our position as one of few publicly listed mid-sized financial services companies offering our clients access to global futures and options products through our well-capitalized independent FCM, structured OTC products through our swaps dealer as well as our physical commodity offerings. We have also taken advantage of opportunities to consolidate sub-scale competitors into our Commercial businesses.

 Institutional 
 We provide institutional clients with a complete suite of equity trading services to help them find liquidity with best execution, consistent liquidity across a robust array of fixed income products, competitive and efficient clearing and execution in all major futures and securities exchanges globally, as well as prime brokerage in equities and major foreign currency pairs and swap transactions. In addition, we originate, structure and place debt instruments in the domestic and international capital markets. These instruments include agency mortgage-backed, commercial mortgage-backed, asset-backed and municipal securities, as well as structured credit. 
 Securities 
 We provide value-added solutions that facilitate cross-border trading in equity securities and believe our clients value our ability to manage complex transactions, including foreign exchange, utilizing our local understanding of market convention, liquidity and settlement protocols around the world. Our clients include U.S.-based regional and national broker-dealers and institutions investing or executing client transactions in international markets and foreign institutions seeking access to the U.S. securities markets. We make markets in more than 16,000 equities on the NYSE, NASDAQ, and various OTC markets, including ETFs and over 7,000 ADRs, GDRs and foreign securities making us one of the leading market makers in foreign securities. In addition, we make prices in more than 10,000 foreign equities listed on foreign exchanges. We are also a broker-dealer in Argentina, Brazil and in the U.K., where we are active in providing institutional executions in the local capital markets. 
 We act as an institutional dealer in fixed income securities, including U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agency, agency mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, as well as investment grade, high yield, convertible and emerging market debt to a client base including asset managers, commercial bank trust and investment departments, broker-dealers and insurance companies. 
 We are an independent full-service provider to introducing broker-dealers IBD s of clearing, custody, research, syndicated and security-based lending products and services, including a proprietary technology platform which offers efficient connectivity to ensure a positive client experience through the clearing and settlement process. We believe we are one of the leading mid-market clearers in the securities industry, with approximately 100 correspondent clearing relationships with over 23 billion in assets under management or administration as of September 30, 2023. 
 We operate an asset management business in which we earn fees, commissions and other revenues for management of third party assets and investment gains or losses on our investments in funds and proprietary accounts managed either by our investment managers or by independent investment managers. 
 Listed Derivatives 
 We provide competitive and efficient clearing and execution in all major futures exchanges globally. Through our platforms, client orders are accepted and directed to the appropriate exchange for execution. We then facilitate the clearing of clients transactions. Clearing involves the matching of clients trades with the exchange, the collection and management of client margin deposits to support the transactions, and the accounting and reporting of the transactions to clients. 
 As of September 30, 2023, our U.S. FCM held 6.1 billion in required client segregated assets, which makes us one the largest non-bank FCMs in the U.S., as measured by required client segregated assets. We seek to leverage our capabilities and capacity in clearing to financial institutions, institutional trading firms, professional traders and introducing brokers as well as offering facilities management or outsourcing solutions to other FCMs. 
 Foreign Exchange 
 We provide prime brokerage foreign exchange FX services to financial institutions and professional traders. We provide our clients with the full range of OTC products, including 24-hour a day execution of spot, forwards and options, as well as non-deliverable forwards in both liquid and exotic currencies.

 Competitive Environment - Institutional Segment 
 The industry in which we provide services within our Institutional segment comprises activities associated with the trading of, and investment in, various financial assets, including equity and debt securities, commodities, foreign currencies, interest rates, and derivatives, both exchange-traded and OTC. This industry also includes various services provided to participants in the financial markets, which allow participants access to liquidity and execution venues, as well as clearing and settlement of transactions. Industry participants include institutional and retail investors, banks, insurance companies, fund managers, hedge funds, investment advisers, proprietary trading firms, commodity trading advisors and commodity pool operators, and foreign institutions and investors seeking access to U.S. markets, as well as various market intermediaries such as market makers, regional and national broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers, FCMs, and investment banks and liquidity venues, such as securities and derivatives exchanges and OTC marketplaces. 
 Trading and investing activity across asset classes is driven by growth in wealth and savings, investors asset allocation and diversification needs, including across geographies, and return objectives, risk management needs and the availability of speculative arbitrage opportunities. Volatility in asset prices generally drives increased trading activity and increased demand for execution and clearing services. 
 Broker-dealers, FCMs, investment banks and other intermediaries create value for institutional clients by facilitating client access to various financial markets, including securities and derivatives exchanges, proprietary sources of liquidity, OTC markets, other institutions and international markets. Market intermediaries can act as market-makers or principal traders that facilitate client trading activity by matching orders internally. Market intermediaries can also act as agents that accept orders, direct them to the appropriate market and facilitate the clearing of client transactions, which involves matching client trades with the exchange, collecting and managing client margin deposits to support the transactions, and accounting and reporting these transactions to clients. 
 Certain market intermediaries, predominantly investment banks, also provide advisory services, securities underwriting, loan syndications, security-based lending products and services, custodial services, investment research products, asset management services and technology platforms for client connectivity. 
 Competitors in the securities and clearing and execution businesses include global banks, institutional broker-dealers, correspondent clearers, independent broker-dealers, clearing FCMs and market-makers. We compete to secure clients based on quality of execution and client service, global access and local market expertise, and the breadth of our product offerings. 
 Regulatory burdens for FCMs and broker-dealers have increased since the financial crisis, which has led to increased complexity and capital requirements that have disproportionately affected smaller firms, driving consolidation. We have benefited from these trends and expect them to continue, and we seek opportunities to participate in further industry consolidation. 
 Retail 
 We provide our retail clients around the world access to over 18,000 global financial markets, including spot foreign exchange and CFDs, which are investment products with returns linked to the performance of underlying assets, and both financial trading and physical investment in precious metals. In addition, our independent wealth management business offers a comprehensive product suite to retail investors in the United States. 
 Retail Forex and CFDs 
 We are a provider of trading services and solutions in the global financial markets, including spot foreign exchange forex and CFDs. We offer CFDs on currencies, commodities, indices, individual equities, cryptocurrencies, bonds, options and interest rate products. 
 We seek to attract and support our clients through direct and indirect channels. Our primary direct channels for our retail forex and CFD business are our mobile platforms and internet websites, FOREX.com and Cityindex.com, which are available in multiple languages, including English, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish and Arabic. Our indirect channels include our relationships with introducing brokers, who solicit clients on our behalf, and white label partners, who offer our trading services to their clients under their own brand. 
 Our proprietary trading technology provides our clients with an enhanced client experience and multiple ways to trade and manage their accounts, tailored to their level of experience and preferred mode of access. In addition, we selectively offer third party trading tools that we believe complement our proprietary offerings. We believe that our proprietary trading technology is a significant competitive advantage because we have the ability to adapt quickly to our clients changing needs. 
 We have longstanding relationships with a large number of institutional liquidity providers, as well as access to multiple liquidity venues. They allow us to offer our clients superior liquidity and more competitive pricing with tighter bid/offer spreads than many of our competitors. In addition, we have developed a proprietary pricing engine that aggregates quotes from

 Competitive Environment - Retail 
 The market for our retail services is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. Our competitors vary by region in terms of regulatory status, breadth of product offering, size and geographic scope of operations. In the retail forex and CFD industry, we compete with both regulated firms focused on forex and CFDs, as well as with global multi-asset trading firms. In wealth management, our competitors vary from large integrated banks and on-line brokerage firms to smaller regional registered investment advisory firms, where competition is driven by reduced commission rates, continued development of online trading platforms and applications and client service. 
 Global Payments 
 We provide customized payment, technology and treasury services to banks and commercial businesses as well as charities, NGOs and government organizations. We provide transparent pricing and offer local currency payments services in more than 180 countries and 140 currencies, which we believe is more than any other payments solutions provider. 
 Our proprietary platforms allow our clients to connect to us digitally and seamlessly with customized solutions for each of our client groups that fit their specific needs. 
 We utilize the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication SWIFT network as well as direct application programming interfaces APIs to service almost 100 financial institutions globally and connect them to our approximately 375 correspondent banks around the world enabling them to make local currency payments in a cost effective and secure manner. 
 Through our platforms and our commitment to client service, we believe we are able to provide simple and fast execution, ensuring delivery of funds in local currency to any of the countries we service quickly through our global network of correspondent banks.

 We believe our clients value our ability to provide exchange rates that are significantly more competitive than those offered by large international banks, a competitive advantage that stems from our years of foreign exchange expertise focused on smaller, less liquid currencies. 
 Competitive Environment - Global Payments 
 Increasing globalization and growth of international trade, as well as the need of corporations, institutions and individuals to move money across borders efficiently, have driven growing activity in the global payments industry. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, corporations require the ability to cost-effectively exchange foreign currencies and to send and receive payments from clients and suppliers. NGOs also demand cross-border payment services as they attempt to bring funding, goods and services to their target geographies and recipients at the lowest possible cost. Even banks require lower cost implementation of foreign exchange transactions, as they are otherwise dependent on correspondent banks, which may subject such transactions to expensive and opaque pricing. 
 Volume growth in the global payments market has been steady, driving revenue growth for cross-border payments providers. Increasingly, this volume growth comes from transactions to emerging economies, benefiting those few providers such as us who have a strong competitive position in those emerging economies and an extensive correspondent bank network that would be difficult to replicate. As reported in the Boston Consulting Group 2023 Global Payments Report, global payments revenues reached 1.6 trillion in 2022 and are expected to grow to 2.2 trillion in 2027 with Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and Europe expected to see the highest growth rates during this period which we believe has potential to directly benefit our payments business. 
 The global payments market has historically been dominated by large Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD banks that provide G20 to non-G20 foreign exchange rates to clients. Such banks, however, are reliant on their correspondent banking network for foreign exchange rates, which often results in uncompetitive rates and a lack of transparency. These issues are further exacerbated by a lack of uniform regulation in the business-to-business B2B global payments sector, with no coordinated regulatory framework, even among significant OECD countries. 
 We believe that the general lack of transparency in bank offerings in the global payments market with regard to fees and exchange rates, the banks often more expensive services, as well as the lack of systematic regulation, have opened opportunities for competitors in this market. As a result, the fast-growing space has attracted significant investor interest. Independent providers have entered the market, leveraging technology to lower client acquisition costs and providing an enhanced client experience through online platforms. In the global payments market, we believe we are one of those independent providers and disruptors offering significant value to our bank, corporate and NGO/charities clients, providing competitive and transparent payments solutions.

 Regulation 
 Overview 
 Our business and the industries in which we operate are highly regulated. Our operating subsidiaries are regulated in a number of jurisdictions including the U.S., the U.K, Luxembourg, Germany, Cyprus, Argentina, Brazil, Dubai, Nigeria, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Australia, Canada and the Cayman Islands. Government regulators and self-regulatory organizations oversee the conduct of our business in many ways, and a number perform regular examinations to monitor our compliance with applicable statutes, regulations and rules. These statutes, regulations and rules cover all aspects of our business, including: 
 maintaining specified minimum amounts of capital and limiting withdrawals of funds from our regulated operating subsidiaries; 
 the treatment of client assets, including custody, control, safekeeping and, in certain countries, segregation of our client funds and securities; 
 the methods by which clients can fund accounts with us; 
 sales and marketing activities, including our interaction with, and solicitation of, clients; 
 disclosures to clients, including those related to product risks, self-dealing and material conflicts of interest; 
 the collection, use, transfer and protection of client personal information; 
 anti-money laundering practices; 
 recordkeeping and reporting requirements; and 
 continuing education and licensing requirements for our employees, and supervision of the conduct of directors, officers and employees. 
 In some jurisdictions in which we offer our products and services, we are not subject to regulation because there is no established regulatory regime that covers our products and services or due to the manner in which we offer our products and services. We consult with legal counsel in jurisdictions in which we operate on a regular basis, or where we have a material concentration of clients, as to whether we have the required authorizations, licenses or approvals or whether we may conduct our business cross-border with residents in that jurisdiction without obtaining local regulatory authorization, approval or consent. To the extent that we wish to serve clients in a jurisdiction in which we determine licensing or registration is required, we may also elect to direct such clients to a licensed white label or other partner, rather than pursuing licensing or registration ourselves. 
 Though we conduct our business in a manner which we believe complies with applicable local law, regulators may assert authority over activities that they deem to take place within the jurisdiction they regulate, and new laws, rules or regulations may be enacted that change the regulatory landscape and result in new, or clarify preexisting, registration or licensing requirements. 
 The primary responsibility for ensuring that we maintain compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements is vested in our legal and compliance departments. In addition, our legal and compliance departments are responsible for our ongoing training and education programs, supervision of our personnel required to be licensed by one or more of our regulators, review of sales, marketing and other communications and other related functions. Also where appropriate, our sales employees are licensed pursuant to applicable regulation. 
 Failure to comply with our regulatory requirements could result in a variety of sanctions, including, but not limited to, revocation of applicable licenses and registrations, restrictions or limitations on our ability to carry on our business, suspensions of individual employees and significant fines. 
 U.S. Regulation 
 The commodities industry in the U.S. is subject to extensive regulation under federal law. We are required to comply with a wide range of requirements imposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC and the National Futures Association (the NFA ).

 The CFTC and NFA also regulate our forex, futures and swaps trading activities. Historically, the principal legislation covering our U.S. forex business was the Commodity Exchange Act, which provides for federal regulation of all commodities and futures trading activities. In recent years, as is the case of other companies in the financial services industry, our forex business has been subject to increasing regulatory oversight. The CFTC Reauthorization Act of 2019, which grants the CFTC express authority to regulate the retail forex industry, includes a series of additional rules which regulate various aspects of our business, including additional risk disclosures to retail forex clients, further limitations on sales and marketing materials and additional rules and interpretive notices regarding NFA mandated Information Systems Security Programs, including training and notification requirements for cybersecurity incidents. 
 Net Capital Requirements

 Segregated Client Assets 
 We maintain client segregated deposits from our clients relating to their trading of futures and options on futures on U.S. commodities exchanges, making us subject to CFTC regulation 1.20, which specifies that such funds must be held in segregation and not commingled with the firm s own assets. We maintain acknowledgment letters from each depository at which we maintain client segregated deposits in which the depository acknowledges the nature of funds on deposit in the account. In addition, CFTC regulations require filing of a daily segregation calculation which compares the assets held in clients segregated depositories segregated assets to the firm s total segregated assets held on deposit from clients segregated liabilities ). The amount of client segregated assets must be in excess of the segregated liabilities owed to clients and any shortfall in such assets must be immediately communicated to the CFTC. 
 In addition, we are subject to CFTC regulation 1.25, which governs the acceptable investment of client segregated assets. This regulation allows for the investment of client segregated assets in readily marketable instruments including U.S. Treasury securities, municipal securities, government sponsored enterprise securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and corporate notes or bonds which are guaranteed by the U.S. under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, interest in money market mutual funds, and repurchase transactions with unaffiliated entities in otherwise allowable securities. We predominately invest our client segregated assets in U.S. Treasury securities and interest-bearing bank deposits. 
 In addition, in our capacity as a securities clearing broker-dealer, we clear transactions for clients and certain proprietary accounts of broker-dealers PABs ). In accordance with Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 15c3-3 ), we maintain special reserve bank accounts SRBAs for the exclusive benefit of securities clients and PABs.

 liabilities ). The amount of retail forex assets must be in excess of the retail forex liabilities owed to clients and any shortfall in such assets must be immediately communicated to the CFTC. 
 Dodd-Frank 
 Like other companies in the financial services industry, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for a number of significant provisions affecting our business. Notably, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the registration of swap dealers with the CFTC and provides framework for: 
 swap data reporting and record keeping on counterparties and data repositories; 
 centralized clearing for swaps, with limited exceptions for end-users; 
 the requirement to execute swaps on regulated swap execution facilities; 
 the imposition on swap dealers to exchange margin on uncleared swaps with counterparties; and 
 the requirement to comply with new capital rules. 
 We are a CFTC registered swap dealer, whose business is overseen by the NFA. The CFTC imposes rules over net capital requirements, as well as the exchange of initial margin between registered swap dealers and certain counterparties. 
 With respect to our retail OTC business, the Dodd-Frank Act includes: 
 rules that require us to ensure that our clients residing in the United States have accounts open only with our U.S. registered NFA-member operating entity; and 
 rules that essentially require all retail transactions in any commodity product other than a retail foreign currency transaction that is traded on a leveraged basis to be executed on an exchange, rather than OTC. 
 OFAC 
 The U.S. maintains various economic sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC ). The OFAC administered sanctions take many forms, but generally prohibit or restrict trade and investment in and with sanctions targets, and in some cases require blocking of the target s assets. Violations of any of the OFAC-administered sanctions are punishable by civil fines, criminal fines, and imprisonment. We believe that we have implemented, and that we maintain, appropriate internal practices, procedures and controls to enable us to comply with applicable OFAC requirements. 
 U.S. Patriot Act 
 We are subject to a variety of statutory and regulatory requirements concerning our relationships with clients and the review and monitoring of their transactions. Specifically, we are subject to the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the USA PATRIOT Act ), which requires that we maintain a comprehensive anti-money laundering AML program, a customer identification program CIP ), designate an AML compliance officer, provide specified employee training and conduct an annual independent audit of our AML program. The USA PATRIOT Act seeks to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. Anti-money laundering laws outside of the U.S. contain similar provisions. We believe that we have implemented, and that we maintain, appropriate internal practices, procedures and controls to enable us to comply with the provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act and other anti-money laundering laws. 
 FINCEN CDD Final Rule 
 Additionally, our US legal entities qualifying as covered financial institutions are subject to the Customer Due Diligence Rule the CDD Rule ), which clarifies and strengthens customer due diligence requirements. This applies to our U.S. broker dealer(s) in securities, FCMs, and introducing brokers in commodities. The CDD Rule requires these covered financial institutions to identify and verify the identity of the natural persons (known as beneficial owners) of legal entity customers who own, control, and profit from companies when those companies open accounts. 
 The CDD Rule has four core requirements. It requires covered financial institutions to establish and maintain written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to: 
 identify and verify the identity of customer; 
 identify and verify the identity of the beneficial owners of companies opening accounts; 
 understand the nature and purpose of customer relationships to develop customer risk profiles; and 
 conduct ongoing monitoring to identify and report suspicious transactions and, on a risk basis, to maintain and update customer information.

 With respect to the requirement to obtain beneficial ownership information, financial institutions will have to identify and verify the identity of any individual who owns 25 percent or more of a legal entity, and an individual who controls the legal entity. A Beneficial Ownership Form or an acceptable equivalent is also required. These requirements are applied to customers which meet the CDD Rule Criteria. 
 European and United Kingdom Regulation 
 The Financial Conduct Authority FCA ), the regulator of investment firms in the U.K., regulates our U.K. subsidiary as a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive MiFID investment firm under U.K. law. In Europe, our regulated subsidiaries are subject to E.U. regulation. Across the U.K. and E.U., the respective transpositions of the Market Abuse Regulation, and the General Data Protection Regulation, also apply. 
 Applicable regulations also impose regulatory capital, as well as conduct of business, governance, and other requirements on these entities. The client assets CASS rules in the FCA regulations include those that govern the handling of client money and other assets which, under certain circumstances must be segregated from the firm s own assets. 
 CFD s referencing cryptocurrencies 
 The FCA has adopted rules to ban the sale of CFDs referencing cryptocurrencies to retail consumers, which became effective in January 2021. 
 Client Money Rules 
 We are subject to the FCA s Client Money rules, under which we are required to: 
 maintain adequate segregation of client funds; 
 maintain adequate records in order to identify appropriate client details; 
 have adequate organizational arrangements in place to minimize the risk that client money may be paid for by the account of a client whose money has not yet been received by us; 
 undertake daily internal and external client money reconciliations within an appropriate risk and control framework; and 
 appoint an individual who is responsible for CASS oversight. 
 Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions 
 As in the U.S., our U.K. and European entities are subject to statutory and regulatory requirements concerning relationships with customers and the review and monitoring of their transactions. Regulated firms in both the U.K. and in the European Union E.U. must have robust governance, effective risk procedures and adequate internal control mechanisms to manage the exposure to financial crime risk. The measures require the U.K. and E.U. entities to verify customer identity and understand the nature and purpose of the proposed relationship on the basis of documents, data or information obtained from a reliable and independent source; and review and monitor their customer s transactions and activities to identify anything suspicious. 
 Our U.K. and E.U. entities take a risk-based approach and senior management are responsible for addressing these risks. There is a requirement to regularly identify and assess the exposure to financial crime risk and report to the governing body on the same. This enables the targeting of financial crime resources on the areas of greatest risk. Procedures in the U.K. and E.U. are based on guidance and requirements issued both at a national and supranational level. 
 The FCA and the financial supervisory authorities in the E.U. require our entities to have systems and controls in place to enable them to identify, assess, monitor and manage financial crime risk. Accordingly, we have implemented appropriate systems and controls which are proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of our activities. We provide relevant training to our employees in relation to financial crime. As required, our Europe, Middle East and Africa EMEA Money Laundering Reporting Officer as well as the Money Laundering Reporting Officer appointed in respect of each of the entities in the E.U. provide regular reports on the operation and effectiveness of these systems and controls, including details of our regular assessments of the adequacy of these systems and controls to ensure their compliance with the local regulatory requirements. 
 Our financial crime systems and controls also include routine screening to identify where customers and others with whom we transact may be subject to financial sanctions, including measures initiated or adopted by inter alia the U.K. Treasury, E.U. or OFAC (as required in the U.S.) 
 EMIR 
 The E.U. European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Regulation (EU) 648/2012) EMIR imposes requirements on entities that enter into any form of derivative contract and applies directly to firms in the E.U. that trade derivatives and indirectly to non-E.U. firms that trade derivatives with E.U. firms. Accordingly, under these rules, we are required to: 
 14 

Table of Contents 

 report all derivative contracts and their lifecycle events (concluded, modified and terminated) to which we are a party to a trade repository either by ourselves or through a third party; 
 keep all records relating to concluding of derivative contracts and any subsequent modification for 5 years; 
 comply with the risk management requirements for OTC bilateral derivatives, including portfolio reconciliation, portfolio compression, record keeping, dispute resolution and margining; and 
 clear through central counterparties all OTC derivatives which will be subject to the mandatory clearing obligation. 
 MiFID 
 Where firms offer execution only services for certain financial instruments which are deemed complex , E.U. Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (Directive 2014/65/EU) MiFID II requires firms to assess the appropriateness of those investments for retail clients. For this assessment, we are required to collect information about our existing and potential clients knowledge and experience with regard to specific products and services, including: 
 the types of services, transactions and financial instruments with which the retail client is familiar; 
 the nature, volume, and frequency of the retail client s transactions in financial instruments and the period over which they have been carried out; and 
 the level of education, and profession or relevant former profession of the retail client or potential retail client. 
 We are required to offer to a retail client or transact for them only those products that are deemed appropriate for their knowledge, experience and other circumstances. If the retail client demands a product that has been assessed as inappropriate for the retail client s circumstances by us, we may either refuse to offer the product to the client or allow them access to the product but we are required to give the retail client a warning that the product may be inappropriate to its circumstances. We are not required to undertake this analysis for professional clients as we are entitled to assume that a professional client has the necessary knowledge and experience in order to understand the risks involved in relation to the particular products or services for which they have been classified as a professional client. 
 In addition to the requirements described above, MiFID II requires that: 
 firms carry out an appropriateness assessment before providing an execution only service to retail clients; 
 transparency is given to derivatives traded on regulated markets, multi-lateral trading facilities MTFs ), and organized trading facilities OTFs 
 transactions are reported for those financial instruments traded on MTFs, OTFs, and those financial instruments where the underlying instrument is traded on a Trading Venue; and 
 E.U. Member State regulators ban or restrict the marketing, distribution or sale of a financial instrument or types of financial practice where there is a threat to investor protection, the orderly functioning and integrity of markets or to financial stability. The European Banking Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority have similar powers to impose a ban on an E.U.-wide basis or in relation to a particular E.U. Member State. 
 Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products 
 Our U.K. entities are required to comply with the PRIIPs Regulation in relation to packaged retail and insurance-based investment products PRIIPs that they manufacture, advise on or sell to retail clients. The FCA regards derivatives (including options, futures, and contracts for difference) as falling within the definition of a PRIIP. The regime requires us to provide retail clients with a standardized key information document KID in good time before any transaction in derivatives is concluded or for transactions concluded by distance communications, after the transaction has taken place, but only if it is not possible to provide the KID in advance and the client consents. 
 Payments Services Regulations 2017 
 The Payments Services Regulations 2017 PSRs implemented the second Payments Services Directive PSD II in the U.K. The most significant development contained in the PSD II is the requirement for payment services firms to introduce strong customer authentication SCA on the payment platforms which was required to be fully implemented by March 2022. 
 Brexit 
 The U.K. left the E.U. in January 2020 pursuant to a Withdrawal Agreement. It entered into a transition period which expired on December 31, 2020. Following the expiration of this transition period, British investment and payment firms have lost the right to conduct business within European Economic Area EEA states based on their home state authorization. Without appropriate authorization, British firms are largely restricted to providing business to clients that are domiciled in the EEA on a reverse solicitation basis. Furthermore, British investment firms have lost certain rights with respect to access to, or providing

 their clients with a connection to, certain infrastructural assets that are necessary for the provision of certain services. An example is the provision of direct electronic access to trading venues authorized in the E.U. 
 StoneX Financial Ltd put in place a comprehensive Brexit contingency plan to mitigate the risks associated with Brexit. This included the transfer of assets, services and clients to StoneX Financial Ltd s subsidiary (StoneX Financial GmbH) and sister company (StoneX Financial Europe S.A). 
 Similarly, the group has executed a plan to mitigate the risks associated with Brexit for retail clients including the establishment of a licensed entity in Cyprus, StoneX Europe Ltd. 
 U.K. Investment Firm Prudential Regime 
 The U.K. implemented a new prudential regime that replaced the previously existing Capital Requirements Regulation CRR and fourth Capital Requirements Directive CRD IV in January 2022. The U.K. Investment Firm Prudential Regime IFPR introduced a more appropriate regime for investment firms, which are currently regulated under rules designed for banks. StoneX Financial Ltd has implemented all required prudential changes under this regime. 
 E.U. Conflict Minerals Regulation 
 The E.U. Conflict Minerals Regulation CMR became effective in January 2021, and in the U.K, the FCA has recognized the Global Precious Metals Code in the U.K. The CMR requires importers to conduct due diligence on their gold, tantalum, tin, and tungsten supply chains to identify minerals that may have originated from conflict zones. The new requirements are largely based on existing guidance issued by the Organisation for Cooperation and Development OECD which StoneX Financial Ltd already applies, as part of its policies and procedures. StoneX Financial Ltd is a full member of the London Bullion Market Association which sets out and oversees adherence to the principles to promote the integrity and effective functioning of the global precious metals market. 
 Other International Regulation 
 Our operating subsidiaries in jurisdictions outside of the U.S., U.K., and E.U. are registered with, or obtained a license from, local regulatory bodies that seek to protect clients by imposing requirements relating to capital adequacy and other matters. 
 Several of our foreign subsidiaries are subject to certain business rules, including those that govern the treatment of client money and other assets which under certain circumstances for certain classes of client must be segregated from the firm s own assets.

 Our business is subject to rules and regulations adopted by state, federal and foreign governments, and regulatory organizations governing data privacy, including for example the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA and the European General Data Protection Regulation GDPR ).

 Performance evaluations . Employee performance is evaluated annually through written self-assessments which are reviewed in discussions with supervisors and managers. Employee performance is assessed based on a variety of key performance indicators, including achievement of objectives specific to the employee s department or role, an assessment of company core competencies, feedback from peers and subordinate employees and managers in other departments and an assessment conducted by the employee s direct manager. 
 Business Unit Trainin g. Business units provide hands-on training to their employees to equip them for success in their roles and provide increased opportunities to develop their careers. 
 Manager Training . Management training is provided to certain senior leaders and mid-level managers. This training covers, among other topics, talent review, development of underperforming employees, handling employee misconduct and coaching and success workshops. 
 Know-Your-Business Programs . We make available to employees a monthly Know-Your-Business program led by senior managers, including our CEO, to provide our employees with the opportunity to learn about our diverse product and service offerings, as well as familiarize themselves with the various operational and administrative support areas. 
 Virtual Networking and Mentoring Programs . We have established networking and mentoring programs to provide an additional means for employees to connect with each other, learn about different parts of our business and to help each other further develop their careers. 
 Employee Health and Welfare 
 We believe that doing our part to maintain the health and welfare of our employees is a critical element for achieving commercial success. As such, we provide our employees with comprehensive health benefits and offer a wellness program which focuses on employee health strategies and includes a discount to employee medical premiums for the completion of wellness initiatives. We promote a culture of hard work and achievement that also strives to provide an appropriate work-life balance for our employees. We conduct employee surveys annually to collect feedback and incorporate into our planning. In addition, we offer employee assistance programs, including confidential assistance for financial, mental and physical well-being. Finally, we believe that the well-being of our employees is enhanced when they can give back to their local communities or charities and have established the Collective Giving program to facilitate participation by our employees in these initiatives and provide a company match for charitable contributions and volunteer hours.

 Diversity and Inclusion 
 We believe that we are more successful commercially with a diverse employee population and encourage hiring and promotion practices that focus on the best talent and the most effective performers, regardless of gender, national origin, ethnicity or other protected class. We have adopted an Affinity Group Policy which provides a framework for groups of employees to interact over areas of common interest. To date, our employees have formed two affinity groups, the Women of StoneX, which focuses on supporting and developing our female employees, and the Philanthropy group, which aims to inspire, educate and mobilize our employees collective giving efforts. In addition, our Board includes two female directors and two self-identified diverse directors, and our Nominating and Governance Committee is actively focused on issues of diversity and inclusion as part of its overall mandate. Because we operate a global business across multiple business segments, products and service areas, we believe it is especially important that we attract employees with diverse backgrounds and the capability to address client needs across the numerous cultures in the countries in which we operate. We continually analyze and monitor gender and ethnicity across our employee population and report regularly into Executive Committee and the Board. 
 Foreign Operations 
 We operate in a number of foreign jurisdictions, including Canada, Ireland, the U.K., Cyprus, Luxembourg, Germany, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay, Paraguay, Mexico, Nigeria, Dubai, China, India, Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore, Japan, Cayman Islands, Bermuda and Poland. We established wholly owned subsidiaries in the Netherlands, Cayman Islands and Bermuda but do not have offices or employees in those countries. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and unfair competition laws in the United States and other jurisdictions to protect our proprietary technology, intellectual property rights and our brands (e.g., StoneX, IRMP, FOREX.com, GAIN Capital, and City Index). We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants, and confidentiality agreements with other third parties. We rigorously control access to our proprietary technology. Currently, we do not have any pending or issued patents. 
 We use a variety of service marks that have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office USPTO ), including: StoneX, IRMP, FCStone, FC Stone, CommodityNetwork, CoffeeNetwork, GAIN Capital, FOREX.com, It s Your World. Trade It., GAIN Capital Futures, and GAIN Futures. We have applications pending with the USPTO for StoneX One, StoneHedge and Global Payments Connect. We also have registered trademarks covering our City Index brand name and logo in a variety of jurisdictions, including Australia, the U.K., the E.U., Singapore and China. We also have pursued trademark protection through the Madrid Protocol covering our StoneX brand name in a variety of jurisdictions. To date, we have received grants of registration in Australia, Brazil, Benelux, Columbia, the U.K., Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Singapore and are awaiting examination resolutions in other jurisdictions. 
 Business Risks 
 We seek to mitigate the market and credit risks arising from our financial trading activities through an active risk management program. The principal objective of this program is to limit trading risk to an acceptable level while maximizing the return generated on the risk assumed. 
 We have a defined risk policy administered by our risk management committee, which reports to the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. We established specific exposure limits for inventory positions in every business, as well as specific issuer limits and counterparty limits. We designed these limits to ensure that in a situation of unexpectedly large or rapid movements or disruptions in one or more markets, systemic financial distress, and the failure of a counterparty or the default of an issuer, the potential estimated loss will remain within acceptable levels. The Risk Committee of our Board of Directors reviews the performance of the risk management committee on a quarterly basis to monitor compliance with the established risk policy. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 We face a variety of risks that could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations, set forth below. 
 Macroeconomic Risks 
 Our ability to achieve consistent profitability is subject to uncertainty due to the nature of our businesses and the markets in which we operate. Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly because of the following factors: 
 market conditions, such as price levels and volatility in the commodities, securities and foreign exchange markets in which we operate; 
 changes in the volume of our market-making and trading activities; 
 changes in the value of our financial instruments, currency and commodities positions and our ability to manage related risks; and 
 18 

Table of Contents 

 the level and volatility of interest rates. 
 There have been significant declines in trading volumes in the financial markets generally in the past and there may be similar declines in trading volumes generally or across our platforms in particular in the future. Any one or more of the above factors may contribute to reduced trading volumes. Our revenues and profitability are likely to decline significantly during periods of stagnant economic conditions or decreased trading volume in the U.S. and global financial markets. 
 Although we continue our efforts to diversify the sources of our revenues, it is likely that our revenues and operating results will continue to fluctuate substantially in the future and such fluctuations could result in losses. These losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 Our net operating revenues may decrease due to changes in client trading volumes which are dependent in large part on commodity prices and commodity price volatility. Our clients trading volumes are largely driven by the degree of volatility the magnitude and frequency of fluctuations in prices of commodities. Higher volatility increases the need to hedge contractual price risk and creates opportunities for arbitrage trading. Energy and agricultural commodities markets periodically experience significant price volatility. In addition to price volatility, increases in commodity prices generally lead to increased trading volume. As prices of commodities rise, especially energy prices, new participants enter the markets to address their growing risk-management needs or to take advantage of greater trading opportunities. Sustained periods of stability in the prices of commodities or generally lower prices could result in lower trading volumes and, potentially, lower revenues. In addition, lower volatility and lower volumes could lead to lower client balances held on deposit, which in turn may reduce the amount of interest revenue and account fees we collect based on these deposits. 
 Factors that are particularly likely to affect price volatility and price levels of commodities include supply and demand of commodities, weather conditions affecting certain commodities, national and international economic and geopolitical conditions, including the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, the perceived stability of commodities and financial markets, the level and volatility of interest rates and inflation and the financial strength of market participants. 
 Low short-term interest rates negatively impact our profitability. We earn interest and fee income on client balances left on deposit with us. We have generated significant interest-related revenue in both the current and prior periods and a decline in short-term interest rates or a decline in the amount of client funds on deposit may have a material adverse effect on our profitability in the future. 
 Short-term interest rates are highly sensitive to factors that are beyond our control and we can provide no assurance as to whether short-term interest rates will decline in the future. 
 Our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and financial market conditions as well as catastrophic events and crises such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, wars and geopolitical tensions. 
 Economic and financial market conditions, including conditions impacted by public health emergencies, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, and geopolitical events such as terrorism, the Israel-Hamas war and escalating tensions in the Middle East, the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia and related sanctions imposed by the U.S. Department of Treasury and other governing bodies in countries in which we conduct business, have created significant market volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. While increased volatility is typically a driver of increased client activity and growth in our operating revenues, longer periods of extreme volatility and dislocation in global securities, foreign exchange and commodity markets may affect our ability to establish effective offsetting positions in our principal trading and market-making activities which may expose us to trading losses. In addition, in the event that a global recession or slowdown occurs, this could lead to extended periods of low short-term interest rates and decreased volatility which could adversely affect our profitability. We also may be exposed to increased counterparty default, liquidity and credit risks with respect to our client accounts, which means if our clients experience losses in excess of the funds they have deposited with us, we may not be able to recover the negative client equity from our clients. In these circumstances, we may nonetheless be required to fund positions with counterparties using our own funds, which in turn would reduce our liquidity buffers. If any of these risks materialize, our operating results or ability to conduct our business may be materially adversely affected. 
 In addition, the recent COVID-19 pandemic led to increased operational and cybersecurity risks and may again do so in the future. These risks have included, among others, increased demand on our information technology resources and systems and the increased risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks. In the event of a significant COVID-19 resurgence, any failure to effectively manage these increased operational and cybersecurity demands and risks may materially adversely affect our results of operations and the ability to conduct our business. For a further discussion of cybersecurity risks, see Technology and Cybersecurity Risks below. 
 To the extent that our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations are adversely affected by catastrophic events and crises, including public health emergencies such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic and conflicts such as the wars in Ukraine and Israel, these events may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein and in any future Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or other filings we make with the SEC.

 Business Risks 
 We face risks associated with our market-making and trading activities. A significant portion of our operating revenues are generated through our market making and trading activities. The success of our market-making and trading activities principally depends on: 
 the price volatility of specific financial instruments, currencies and commodities; 
 our ability to attract order flow and our competitiveness; 
 the skill of our personnel, including the efficiency of our order execution, quality of our client service and the sophistication of our trading technology; 
 the availability of sufficient capital, in order to provide enhanced liquidity to our clients; and 
 general market conditions. 
 We conduct our market-making and trading activities predominantly as a principal and therefore hold positions that bear the risk of significant price fluctuations, rapid changes in the liquidity of markets, deterioration in the creditworthiness of our counterparties and other risks that may cause the value of our positions to decline, which would lead to lower operating revenues. 
 In addition, as a market maker, while we seek to hedge our exposure to market risk relating to the positions we hold, at any given moment, our unhedged exposure subjects us to market risk, including the risk of significant losses. Principal gains and losses resulting from our positions could have a disproportionate effect, positive or negative, on our financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting period. These risks are increased when we have concentrated positions in securities of a single issuer or issuers in specific countries and markets, which is the case from time-to-time. 
 Declines in the volume of securities, commodities and derivative transactions and in market liquidity generally may result in lower revenues from market-making and trading activities. Changes in price levels of securities and commodities and other assets, and in interest and foreign exchange rates also may result in reduced trading activity and reduce our revenues from market-making transactions. Changes in price levels also may result in losses in the fair value of securities, commodities and other assets held in inventory. Sudden sharp changes in the fair value of securities, commodities and other assets can result in a number of adverse consequences for our business, including illiquid markets, fair value losses arising from positions held by us, and the failure of buyers and sellers of securities, commodities and other assets to fulfill their settlement obligations. Any change in market volume, price or liquidity or any other of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 We operate as a principal in the OTC derivatives markets which involves significant risks associated with commodity derivative instruments in which we transact. We offer OTC derivatives to our clients in which we act as a principal counterparty. We endeavor to simultaneously offset the underlying risk of the instruments, such as commodity price risk, by establishing corresponding offsetting positions with commodity counterparties, or alternatively we may offset those transactions with similar but not identical positions on an exchange. To the extent that we are unable to simultaneously offset an open OTC derivative position or the offsetting transaction is not effective to fully eliminate the derivative risk, we have market risk exposure on these unmatched transactions. Our exposure varies based on the size of our overall positions, the terms and liquidity of the instruments we offer to our clients and the amount of time the positions remain open. 
 While we mitigate market risk on OTC derivative positions with strict risk limits, limited holding periods and active risk management, adverse movements in the referenced assets or rates underlying these positions or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these positions could result in a substantial loss. In addition, any principal gains and losses resulting from these positions could have a disproportionate effect, positive or negative, on our financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting period. 
 Transactions involving OTC derivative contracts may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the level, volatility, correlation or relationship between market prices, rates, indices and/or other factors. These types of instruments may also suffer from illiquidity in the market or in a related market. 
 OTC derivative transactions are subject to unique risks. OTC derivative transactions are subject to the risk that, as a result of mismatches or delays in the timing of cash flows due from or to counterparties in OTC derivative transactions or related hedging, trading, collateral or other transactions, we or our counterparty may not have adequate cash available to fund our or its current obligations. 
 We could incur material losses pursuant to OTC derivative transactions because of inadequacies in or failures of our internal systems and controls for monitoring and quantifying the risk and contractual obligations associated with OTC derivative transactions and related transactions or for detecting human error, systems failure or management failure. 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 OTC derivative transactions may generally be modified or terminated only by mutual consent of the parties to any such transaction (other than in certain limited default and other specified situations (e.g., market disruption events)) and subject to agreement on individually negotiated terms. Accordingly, it may not be possible to modify, terminate or offset obligations or exposure to the risk associated with a transaction prior to its scheduled termination date. 
 In addition, we note that as a result of rules adopted by U.S. and foreign regulators concerning certain financial contracts, including OTC derivatives, entered into with our counterparties that have been designated as global systemically important banking organizations, we may be restricted in our ability to terminate such contracts following the occurrence of certain insolvency-related default events. Transactions with these counterparties, therefore, carry heightened risk in the event that the counterparty defaults on its obligations to us. 
 We are subject to margin funding requirements on short notice. Our business involves establishment and carrying of substantial open positions for clients on futures exchanges and in the OTC derivatives markets. We are required to post and maintain margin or credit support for these positions. Although we collect margin or other deposits from our clients for these positions, significant adverse price movements can occur which will require us to post margin or other deposits on short notice, whether or not we are able to collect additional margin or credit support from our clients. We maintain borrowing facilities for the purpose of funding margin and credit support and have in place procedures for collecting margin and other deposits from clients on a same-day basis; however, there can be no assurance that these facilities and procedures will provide us with sufficient funds to satisfy funds to satisfy any additional margin or credit support we may be required to post in the event of severe adverse price movements affecting the open positions of our clients. Generally, if a client is unable to meet its margin call, we promptly liquidate the client s account. However, there can be no assurance that in each case the liquidation of the account will not result in a loss to us or that liquidation will be feasible, given market conditions, size of the account and tenor of the positions. 
 We are exposed to counterparty credit risk whereby the failure by persons with whom we do business to meet their financial obligations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are exposed to the risk that our counterparties fail to meet their obligations to us or to other parties, resulting in significant financial loss to us. These risks include: 
 failure by our clients and counterparties to fulfill contractual obligations and honor commitments to us; 
 failure by clients to deposit additional collateral for their margin loans during periods of significant price declines; 
 failure by our clients to meet their margin obligations; 
 failure by our hedge counterparties to meet their obligations to us; 
 failure by our clearing brokers and banks to adequately discharge their obligations on a timely basis or remain solvent; and 
 default by clearing members in the clearing houses in the U.S. and abroad of which we are members which could cause us to absorb shortfalls pro rata with other clearing members. 
 These and similar events could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we have policies, procedures and automated controls in place to identify and manage our credit risk, there can be no assurance that they will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure. If our policies, procedures and automated controls fail, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 We are subject to risk of default by financial institutions that hold our funds and our clients funds. We have significant deposits of our own funds and our clients' funds with banks and other financial institutions, including liquidity providers. Although we did not have any material deposits with any of the banks affected by the banking crisis (such as the closure of Silicon Valley Bank, receiverships of First Republic Bank and Signature Bank, and acquisition of Credit Suisse Group AG), we could experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of other financial institutions and other parties. If other banks and financial institutions enter receivership or become insolvent in the future in response to financial conditions affecting the banking system and financial markets, we might not be able to fully recover the assets we have deposited, or deposited on our customers behalf, since in certain cases, we will be among the institution s unsecured creditors. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of these funds. 
 We rely on relationships with introducing brokers for obtaining some of our clients and our business or reputation could be harmed by such introducing broker misconduct or errors. We have relationships with introducing brokers, both domestic and international, who solicit clients for their execution and/or advisory services. Those introducing brokers work to establish execution and/or clearing accounts with our entities for those new client relationships but generally serve as the primary relationship and customer service point for those clients. Many of our relationships with introducing brokers are non-exclusive or may be canceled on relatively short notice. In addition, our introducing brokers have no obligation to provide new client relationships or minimum levels of transaction volume. To the extent any of our competitors offers more attractive compensation terms to one or more of our introducing brokers, we could lose the brokers services or be required to increase the 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 compensation we pay to retain the brokers. Further, we may agree to set the compensation for one or more introducing brokers at a level where, based on the transaction volume generated by clients directed to us by such brokers, it would have been more economically attractive to seek to acquire the clients directly rather than through the introducing broker. Our failure to maintain our relationships with these introducing brokers or the failure of these introducing brokers to establish and maintain client relationships could result in a loss of revenues, which would adversely affect our business. 
 We may be held responsible by regulators or third-party plaintiffs for any improper conduct by our introducing brokers, even though we do not control their activities. This may be the case even when the introducing brokers are separately regulated. Many of our introducing brokers operate websites, which they use to advertise our services or direct clients to us and there may be statements on such websites in relation to our services that may not be accurate and may not comply with applicable rules and regulations. Any disciplinary action taken against us relating to the activities of our introducing brokers, or directly against any of our introducing brokers could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, damage our brand name and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 Products linked to cryptocurrencies could expose us to technology, regulatory and financial risks. We offer derivative products linked to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in certain jurisdictions, and may expand the types of these products offered, the associated types of cryptocurrencies and the jurisdictions in which the products are offered. The distributed ledger technology underlying cryptocurrencies and other similar financial assets is evolving at a rapid pace and may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or have other inherent weaknesses that are not yet apparent. We may be, or may become, exposed to risks related to cryptocurrencies or other financial products that rely on distributed ledger technology through our facilitation of clients activities involving such financial products linked to distributed ledger technology. 
 There is currently no broadly accepted regulatory framework for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, and the regulation of cryptocurrencies is developing and changing rapidly in the U.S. and other countries around the world. For example, in the U.S., it is unclear whether many cryptocurrencies are securities under federal securities laws, and the implications for us if any of our products linked to cryptocurrencies are determined to be securities could be significant and adverse. In addition, some market observers have asserted that historical material price fluctuations in many cryptocurrency markets, such as that for Bitcoin, may indicate the propensity for cryptocurrency markets to bubble, and if markets for any cryptocurrencies linked to our products suffer severe fluctuations, our clients could experience significant losses and we could lose their business. 
 The manner in which we account for certain of our precious metals and energy commodities inventory may increase the volatility of our reported earnings. Our net income is subject to volatility due to the manner in which we report our precious metals and energy commodities inventory held by subsidiaries that are not broker-dealers. Our precious metals and energy inventory held in subsidiaries which are not broker-dealers is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We generally mitigate the price risk associated with our commodities inventory through the use of derivatives. We do not elect hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP for this price risk mitigation. In such situations, any unrealized gains in our precious metals and energy inventory in our non-broker-dealer subsidiaries are not recognized under U.S. GAAP, but unrealized gains and losses in related derivative positions are recognized under U.S. GAAP. As a result, our reported earnings from these business segments are subject to greater volatility than the earnings from our other business segments. 
 Our risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could harm our business. Our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated. Our risk management policies and procedures require, among other things, that we record and monitor thousands of transactions each day and we face the significant risk that we are not able to appropriately manage the risk associated with the large volume of transactions. 
 Our risk management policies and procedures rely on a combination of technology and human controls and supervision that are subject to error and failure. Some of our methods for managing risk are discretionary by nature and are based on internally developed controls and observed historical market behavior, and also involve reliance on standard industry practices. These methods may not adequately prevent losses, particularly as they relate to extreme market movements, which may be significantly greater than historical fluctuations in the market. In addition, our risk management policies and procedures also may not adequately prevent losses due to technical errors if our testing and quality control practices are not effective in preventing software or hardware failures. To the extent that we elect to adjust our risk management policies and procedures to allow for an increase in risk tolerance, we will be exposed to the risk of greater losses. Even if we our risk management procedures are effective in mitigating known risks, new unanticipated risks may arise and we may not be protected against significant financial loss stemming from these unanticipated risks. These new risks may emerge if, among other reasons, regulators adopt new interpretations of existing laws, new laws are adopted or third-parties initiate litigation against us based on new, novel or unanticipated legal theories. Our risk management policies and procedures may not prevent us from experiencing a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.

 Technology and Cybersecurity Risks 
 Our revenues, operational costs, regulatory compliance and client satisfaction could be adversely affected by the failure of a vendor or other third party to continue providing services to us. We rely on vendors and other third-parties to provide us with services that are essential to our ability to provide clients with our products and services. These services range from core infrastructure, such as utilities, communications and web hosting services, to systems that allow us to execute and process transactions entered into by our clients. 
 If these vendors or other third-parties suffer operations issues, including as a result of cyber attacks, and they are unable to continue to provide these services to us, we may be exposed to a variety of risks, including loss of revenue if our clients cannot trade with us, increased costs if we are required to employ alternative solutions and reputational harm. 
 In addition, some of our vendors hold sensitive information on our behalf, including personally identifiable information relating to our clients. If this data were to be compromised, either as a result of a cyber attack or otherwise, we could be in breach of our obligations to our clients, as well as applicable data protections laws, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and reputation. 
 Cyber attacks directed at our vendors may also make us more vulnerable to being targeted for cyber attacks ourselves if the bad actors are able to obtain information relating to our company and / or systems. 
 If one of our vendors experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or has data that it holds misappropriated, we could be exposed to a number of additional risks, including: 
 a. heightened risk that we will not be able to comply with applicable regulatory requirements; 
 b. increased risk that external parties will be able to execute fraudulent transactions using our systems; 
 c. losses from fraudulent transactions, as well as potential liability for losses suffered by our clients; 
 d. increased operational costs to remediate the consequences of the external party s security breach; and 
 e. reputational harm arising from the perception that our systems may not be secure. 
 In some cases, operational issues or security breaches affecting our vendors may require us to take steps to protect the integrity of our own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information that we hold, including restricting the ability of our clients to trade or have access to their accounts. These actions could potentially diminish customer satisfaction and confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our results of operations. 
 For example, on January 31, 2023, we were notified by ION Group, one of our vendors which provides back office trade processing services relating to certain of our listed derivatives businesses, that it had experienced a cybersecurity incident, which rendered certain of its services inaccessible to us and its other clients. As a result of the incident, we imposed restrictions on clients of our UK subsidiary relating to the trading of listed derivatives. During February 2023, these services were restored and the restrictions on clients activities were lifted . 
 Furthermore, the widespread and expanding interconnectivity among financial institutions, clearing banks, CCPs, payment processors, financial technology companies, securities exchanges, clearing houses and other financial market infrastructures increases the risk that the disruption of an operational system involving one institution or entity, including due to a cyber attack, may cause industry-wide operational disruptions that could materially affect our ability to conduct business. 
 Internal or third-party computer and communications systems failures, capacity constraints and breaches of security could increase our operating costs and/or credit losses, decrease net operating revenues and cause us to lose clients. We are heavily dependent on the capacity and reliability of the computer and communications systems supporting our operations, whether owned and operated internally or by vendors or third parties, including those used for execution and clearance of our clients trades and our market-making activities. We receive and process a large portion of our trade orders through electronic means, such as through public and private communications networks. These computer and communications systems and networks are subject to performance degradation or failure due to any number of reasons, including loss of power, acts of war or terrorism, human error, natural disasters, fire, sabotage, hardware or software malfunctions or defects, computer viruses, cyber attacks, intentional acts of vandalism, client error or misuse, lack of proper maintenance or monitoring and similar events. While we currently maintain business continuity and disaster recovery plans (the BCPs ), which are intended to minimize service interruptions and secure data integrity, our BCPs may not be sufficient or work effectively during an emergency. 
 Similarly, although some contracts with our third-party providers, such as our hosting facility providers, require adequate disaster recovery or business continuity capabilities, we cannot be certain that these will be adequate or implemented properly. Our disaster recovery and business continuity plans are heavily reliant on the availability of the internet and mobile phone technology, so any disruption of those systems would likely affect our ability to recover promptly from a crisis situation. If we are unable to execute our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, or if our plans prove insufficient for a particular situation or take longer than expected to implement in a crisis situation, our business, financial condition and results of 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 operations could be materially adversely affected, and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur. 
 Our inability to avoid or adequately address the failure of our key computer and communication systems exposes us to significant risks, including: 
 unanticipated disruptions in service to our clients; 
 slower response times, delays in trade execution and failed settlement of trades; 
 incomplete, untimely or inaccurate accounting, recording, reporting or processing of trades; 
 financial losses; and 
 litigation or other client claims and regulatory sanctions. 
 We hold a large amount of personally identifiable information relating to our clients and other counterparties, which exposes us to significant regulatory and financial risks if such information is not properly safeguarded. In connection with our business, we collect and retain personally identifiable information of our clients. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of the serious threats to information security in general and as it relates to our business. Our clients expect that we will adequately protect their personal information, and the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is rapidly evolving and increasingly demanding. Protecting against security breaches, including cyber-security attacks, is an increasing challenge, and penetrated or compromised data systems or the intentional or inadvertent release or disclosure of data has in the past, and may in the future, result in theft, loss or fraudulent or unlawful use of client or company data. It is possible that our security controls over personally identifiable information, our training of employees on data security and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information that we collect, store and manage. 
 We are exposed to significant risks relating to cybersecurity attacks against our trading platforms, internal databases and other technology systems. Cybersecurity attacks across industries, including ours, are increasing in sophistication and frequency and may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to measures targeted specifically at us. These attacks include but are not limited to, malicious software or viruses, attempts to gain unauthorized access to, or otherwise disrupt, our information systems, attempts to gain unauthorized access to proprietary information, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Cybersecurity failures may be caused by employee error or malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, including vulnerabilities of our vendors, suppliers, and their products. We have been subject to cybersecurity attacks in the past, including breaches of our information technology systems, and may experience them in the future, potentially with more frequency or sophistication. Although we maintain cyber risk insurance, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses from any future breaches of our systems. 
 System failures, inadvertent disclosure of client personal information and/or cybersecurity breaches expose us to financial losses, regulatory fines or sanctions and third-party litigation. The degradation or failure of the communications and computer systems on which we rely, due to internal system issues, vendor or other third party issues, cybersecurity attacks or for other reasons, or the significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of client information under any circumstances, may lead to financial losses, litigation or arbitration claims filed by or on behalf of our clients, and regulatory investigations and sanctions against us. These events could also have a negative effect on our reputation, which in turn could cause us to lose existing clients to our competitors or make it more difficult for us to attract new clients in the future. 
 Rapid market or technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our products and services to our clients. We must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platforms. The financial services industry is characterized by significant structural changes, increasingly complex systems and infrastructures, changes in clients needs and preferences and new business models. If new industry standards and practices emerge and our competitors release new technology before us, our existing technology, systems and electronic trading platforms may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed. Our future success will depend on our ability to: 
 enhance our existing products and services; 
 develop and/or license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our clients and prospective clients; 
 continue to attract highly-skilled technology personnel; and 
 respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis. 
 Developing our electronic trading platforms and other technology entails significant technical and business risks. We may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our electronic trading platforms, information databases and network infrastructure to client requirements or emerging industry standards. If we face material delays in introducing new services, products and enhancements, our clients may forego the use of our platforms and use those of our competitors.

 Further, the adoption of new internet, networking, cloud, telecommunications or blockchain technologies may require us to devote substantial resources to modify and adapt our services. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology and transaction-processing systems to client requirements or emerging industry standards. We cannot assure that we will be able to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or client requirements. 
 Debt Financing and Indebtedness Risks 
 The success of our business depends on us having access to significant liquidity. Our business requires substantial cash to support our operating activities, including establishing and carrying substantial open positions for clients on futures exchanges and in the OTC derivatives markets by posting and maintaining margin or credit support for these positions. Although we collect margin or other deposits from our clients for these positions, significant adverse price movements can occur which will require us to post margin or other deposits on short notice, whether or not we are able to collect additional margin or credit support from our clients. We have systems in place to collect margin and other deposits from clients on a same-day basis, however, there can be no assurance that these facilities and systems will be enable us to obtain additional cash on a timely basis. As such, the Company is highly dependent on its lines of credit and other financing facilities in order to fund margin calls and other operating activities and the loss of access to these sources of financing could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 In addition, tightening of the credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures, if and when needed. For example, Signature Bank was a lender under certain of our facilities, and although we did not experience any adverse impact upon the receivership of Signature Bank, we could experience reduced access to liquidity due to failures of other financial institutions and other parties. If other banks and financial institutions enter receivership or become insolvent in the future in response to financial conditions affecting the banking system and financial markets, our ability to access our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments may be threatened and could substantially and negatively impact our financial condition and ability to do business. 
 Our significant level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As of September 30, 2023, our total consolidated indebtedness was 683.1 million, and we may increase our indebtedness in the future as we continue to expand our business. The level of our indebtedness could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including: 
 requiring that an increasing portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and general corporate requirements; 
 limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and general corporate requirements: 
 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the economy, the markets, regulatory requirements, our operations or business; 
 increasing the risk of a future downgrade of our credit ratings, which could increase future debt costs; and restricting our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance existing debt as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. 
 We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including secured indebtedness. If new indebtedness is added to our current indebtedness levels, the related risks that we now face could increase materially. 
 As of September 30, 2023, 341.0 million of our borrowings are subject to variable interest rates and as such in periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds will increase, which could reduce our net income. 
 Committed credit facilities currently available to us might not be renewed. As of September 30, 2023, we had five committed credit facilities under which we could borrow up to 1,200.0 million, consisting of: 
 a 500.0 million facility for general working capital requirements, committed until April 21, 2026; 
 a 190.0 million facility for short-term funding of margin to commodity exchanges, committed until October 29, 2024; 
 a 400.0 million committed facility for financing commodity financing arrangements and commodity repurchase agreements, committed until July 28, 2024; 
 a 100.0 million facility for short-term funding of margin to commodity exchanges, committed until October 12, 2024; and 
 a 10.0 million facility for general working capital requirements, committed until September 6, 2024; 
 It is possible that these facilities might not be renewed at the end of their commitment periods and that we will be unable to replace them with other facilities on terms favorable to us or at all. If our credit facilities are unavailable or are insufficient to 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 support future levels of business activity, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, in such circumstances, we may need to raise additional debt or equity financing on terms that are unattractive or dilutive to our current shareholders. Moreover, if we cannot raise additional funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to develop or enhance our business, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressure or unanticipated requirements, leading to reduced profitability. 
 The agreements governing our notes and other debt contain financial covenants that impose restrictions on our business. The indenture governing our 8.625 Senior Secured Notes due 2025 and the agreements governing our above-mentioned committed credit facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions and limit our ability and that of our restricted subsidiaries to incur and guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, capital stock and prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt, among other restrictions. 
 Our failure to comply with these restrictive covenants, as well as others contained in any future debt instruments entered into from time to time, could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their maturity. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, to obtain additional debt or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Global Regulatory Risks 
 The scope and complexity of the regulation to which we are subject creates significant risks for us. The securities and derivatives industries are subject to extensive regulation under federal, state and foreign laws. In addition, the SEC, the CFTC, FINRA, the MSRB, the FCA, the Financial Services Authority, the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority, the NFA, the CME Group, Inc. and other self-regulatory organizations (commonly referred to as SROs), state securities commissions, and foreign securities regulators require compliance with their respective rules and regulations. 
 These regulations govern a broad and diverse range of our activities, including, without limitation, risk management, disclosures to clients, reporting requirements, client identification and anti-money laundering requirements, safeguarding client assets and personal information and the conduct of our directors, officers and employees. 
 Failure to comply with any of these laws, rules or regulations could result in material adverse effects on or business, results of operations and financial condition, including as a result of regulatory investigations and enforcement proceedings, civil litigation, fines and/or other settlement payments. In addition, changes in existing rules or regulations, including the interpretation thereof, or the adoption of new rules or regulations, could subject us to increased cost and risk of regulatory investigation or civil litigation, on or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The cost of complying with our regulatory requirements is significant and could increase materially in the future. 
 We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs to comply with our regulatory requirements, including with respect to the development, operation and continued enhancement of our trading platforms and technology solutions relating to trade execution, trade reporting, trade surveillance and transaction monitoring, record keeping and data reporting. New regulations, including amendments of existing rules, could result in material increases in operating costs in order to comply with additional regulatory requirements. 
 We are exposed to significant risk from civil litigation and regulatory enforcement actions against us. As a result of the broad scope of our highly regulated business activities and our large and diverse client population, we are a party to a significant number of lawsuits and regulatory investigations and proceedings, which are costly and time consuming to defend or address and expose us to risk of loss and fines and penalties. Moreover, the amounts involved in the trades we execute, together with the potential for rapid price movements in the products we offer, can result in potentially large damage claims in any litigation that arises in connection with such trades. 
 In addition, the volume of claims and the amount of damages and fines claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services firms has been increasing and may continue to increase. The risks relating to litigation and regulatory investigations and enforcement actions will also increase as our business expands. 
 For a further discussion of litigation risks, see Item 3 Legal Proceedings below and Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain significant levels of net capital and if our subsidiaries fail to meet these requirements, we face suspension, expulsion or limitation on our product lines. Our regulated subsidiaries are subject to a number of requirements to maintain specific levels of net capital. Failure to maintain the required net capital may subject our 
 26 

Table of Contents 

 subsidiaries to suspension or revocation of their license or registration or expulsion from regulatory bodies. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 In addition to these net capital requirements, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to the deposit and/or collateral requirements of the clearing houses and exchanges in which such subsidiaries participate. These requirements may fluctuate significantly from time to time based upon the nature and size of client trading activity. Failure to meet such requirements could result in our inability to continue to participate in such clearinghouses and exchanges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. 
 Changes in existing net capital rules or the issuance of new rules could restrict our operations or limit our ability to issue dividends or repay debt. Our business depends on the use of capital, most of which is generated and held by our operating subsidiaries. If there are changes to existing net capital rules, or new rules are issued, that require us to hold additional capital at our operating subsidiaries, we may be unable to issue dividends from our subsidiaries to fund our operations or repay our debt, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. 
 Rapidly evolving regulations regarding data privacy could increase our costs and adversely affect our business. Our business is subject to rules and regulations adopted by state, federal and foreign governments, and regulatory organizations governing data privacy, including, but not limited to for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA and the European General Data Protection Regulation GDPR ). Additional states, as well as foreign jurisdictions, have enacted or are proposing similar data protection regimes, resulting in a rapidly evolving landscape governing how we collect, use, transfers and protect personal data. These new regulations, as well as changes to existing rules, could result in material increases in operating costs and impact the manner in which our products and services can be offered to our clients. Any failure to comply with the CCPA, GDPR or other applicable data protection regulations could subject us to risk of regulatory investigation, penalties, civil litigation and reputational harm, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. 
 International Operations Risks 
 Our international operations involve special challenges that we may not be able to meet, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. We engage in a significant amount of business with clients in markets outside the United States. We face certain additional risks that are inherent in doing business in international markets, particularly in the regulated industries in which we participate. These risks include an inability to manage and coordinate the various regulatory requirements of multiple jurisdictions that are constantly evolving and are also subject to unexpected change, difficulties of debt collection and enforcement of contractual rights in foreign jurisdictions and reduced protection for intellectual property rights. 
 Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could negatively impact our earnings. A significant portion of our international business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar can therefore affect the value of our non U.S. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. Although we closely monitor potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies and adopt strategies designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on our financial results, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in managing our foreign exchange risk and potential movements in the U.S. dollar against other currencies could adversely affect our results of operations. Our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow if the relative contribution of our operations outside the U.S. increases. Any material fluctuations in currencies could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our international operations are subject to the political, legal and economic risks associated with politically unstable and less developed regions of the world, including the risk of war and other international conflicts and actions by governmental authorities, insurgent groups, terrorists and others. Our international operations are subject to specific risks that are more likely to arise in politically unstable and less developed regions of the world. We may conduct business in countries that are the subject of actual or threatened war, terrorist activity, outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases, such as COVID-19, political instability, civil strife and other geopolitical uncertainty, economic and financial instability, highly inflationary environment, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers, exchange rate fluctuations, applicable currency controls, the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including reliance on local experts. As a result of these and other factors, the currencies of these countries may be unstable. Future instability in such currencies or the imposition of governmental or regulatory restrictions on such currencies or on business in such countries could impede our foreign business. 
 As we operate or otherwise extend our services in certain jurisdictions without local registration, licensing or authorization, we may be subject to possible enforcement action and sanction for our operations in such jurisdictions if our operations are determined to have violated regulations in those jurisdictions. Further, we may be required to cease operations in one or more of the countries in which we operate without registration, licensing or authorization, or our growth may be limited by newly imposed regulatory or other restrictions. A portion of our trading volume is attributable to clients in jurisdictions in 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 which we or our white label partners are not currently licensed or authorized by the local government or applicable self-regulatory organization. This includes jurisdictions, such as China, from which we derive revenue and profit, and in which the local government has not adopted specific regulations governing the trading of foreign exchange and CFD products of the types we offer to clients, and jurisdictions in which we operate or otherwise extend our services in reliance on exemptions from the regulatory regime. We determine the nature and extent of services we can offer and the manner in which we conduct our business in the various jurisdictions in which we serve clients based on a variety of factors, including legal advice received from local counsel, our review of applicable U.S. and local laws and regulations and, in some cases, our discussions with local regulators. In cases in which we operate in jurisdictions based on local legal advice and/or cross border in a manner that we believe does not require us to be regulated in a particular jurisdiction, we are exposed to the risk that our legal, regulatory and other analysis is subsequently determined by a local regulatory agency or other authority to be incorrect and that we have not been in compliance with local laws or regulations, including local licensing or authorization requirements, and to the risk that the regulatory environment in a jurisdiction may change, including in a circumstance where laws or regulations or licensing or authorization requirements that previously were not enforced become subject to enforcement. 
 In such jurisdictions in which we are not licensed or authorized, we may be subject to a variety of restrictions regarding the manner in which we conduct our business or serve clients, including restrictions on: 
 our sales and marketing activities; 
 the use of a website specifically targeted to potential clients in a particular country; 
 our ability to have a physical presence in a particular country; or 
 the types of services we may offer clients physically present in each country. 
 These restrictions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and/or may limit our ability to grow or continue to operate our business in any such jurisdiction or may result in increased overhead costs or degradation in our services in that jurisdiction. Consequently, we cannot assure you that our operations in jurisdictions where we are not licensed or authorized will continue uninterrupted or that our international expansion plans will be achieved. 
 We may be subject to possible enforcement action and penalties if we are determined to have previously offered, or currently offer, our services in violation of applicable laws and regulations in any of the markets in which we serve clients. In any such case, we may be required to cease the conduct of our business with clients in one or more jurisdictions. We may also determine that compliance with the laws or licensing, authorization or other regulatory requirements for continuing the business in one or more jurisdictions are too onerous to justify making the necessary changes. In addition, any such event could negatively impact our relationship with the regulators or self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions where we are subject to regulation. 
 Our operations are required to comply with specific anti-corruption and record-keeping laws and regulations applicable to companies conducting business internationally, and if we violate these laws and regulations, it could adversely affect our business and subject us to broader liability. Our international business operations are subject to various anti-corruption laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA and trade sanctions administered by OFAC. The FCPA is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect those companies transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against designated foreign states, organizations and individuals. Though we have policies in place designed to comply with applicable OFAC sanctions, rules and regulations as well as the FCPA and equivalent laws and rules of other jurisdictions, including the UK Bribery Act 2010, there can be no assurance that, in the future, the operations of our businesses will not violate these laws and regulations, and we could be exposed to claims for damages, financial penalties, reputational harm, incarceration of employees and restrictions on our operations and cash flows. 
 The U.K. s withdrawal from the European Union could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. On January 31, 2020, the U.K. withdrew from membership in the E.U., which exit, referred to as Brexit, has caused disruptions to, and created uncertainty surrounding, our business in the U.K. and E.U., including the elimination of our historical right to serve clients in the E.U. from the U.K. on a passport basis and changes to U.K. and E.U. immigration policy, limiting our access to and ability to compete for and hire, skilled employees in both the U.K. and the E.U. Brexit could also impact our existing and future relationships with suppliers and employees in the U.K. and E.U. by disrupting the free movement of goods, services, and people between the U.K., the E.U., and elsewhere. As a result, Brexit could have an adverse effect on our future business, financial results and operations. 
 The long-term impact of the U.K. s revised agreement with the E.U. and others is unclear. Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate. Further, uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the U.K. and the other economies in which we operate. There can be no assurance that any or all of these events will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations.

 Competition Risk 
 We are subject to intense competition. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from market-making and trading activities involving securities, commodities and foreign exchange. The market for these services, particularly market-making services through electronic platforms, is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. We expect competition to continue and increase in the future. We compete primarily with wholesale, national and regional broker-dealers and FCMs, as well as electronic communications networks and retail brokers. We compete primarily on the basis of our expertise and quality of service. 
 We also derive a significant portion of our revenues from commodities risk management services. The commodity risk management industry is very competitive and we expect competition to continue to intensify in the future. Our primary competitors in this industry include both large, diversified financial institutions and commodity-oriented businesses, smaller firms that focus on specific products or regional markets and independent FCMs. 
 A number of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have. Some of them: 
 offer alternative forms of financial intermediation as a result of superior technology and greater availability of information; 
 offer a wider range of services and products than we offer; 
 are larger and better capitalized; 
 have greater name recognition; and 
 have more extensive client bases. 
 These competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities and client requirements. They may also be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities and offer more attractive terms to clients. 
 Alternatively, some of our competitors are smaller, subject to lower capital requirements, and may be able to adopt and implement emerging technologies more quickly. 
 Recent advances in computing and communications technology are substantially changing the means by which market-making and brokerage services are delivered, including more direct access on-line to a wide variety of services and information. This has created demand for more sophisticated levels of client service. Providing these services may entail considerable cost without an offsetting increase in revenues. In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships or may consolidate to enhance their services and products. New competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and they may acquire significant market share. 
 We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. 
 Organizational Risks 
 Our growth has depended significantly on acquisitions. A large proportion of our historical growth has been achieved through acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies or services. Our operating revenues grew from 1,106.1 million in fiscal 2019 to 2,914.1 million in fiscal 2023 principally as a result of several acquisitions. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to engage in additional suitable acquisitions on attractive terms or at all, or that we would be able to obtain financing for future transactions. If we are not able enter into additional transactions, our growth may be adversely affected. 
 There are numerous significant risks associated with acquisitions and our failure to adequately manage these risks could lead to financial loss and a failure to realize the benefits of the transactions. There are a number of significant challenges that need to be overcome in order to realize the benefits of acquisitions, including: 
 integrating the management teams, strategies, cultures, technologies and operations of the acquired companies; 
 retaining and assimilating the key personnel of acquired companies; 
 retaining existing clients of the acquired companies; 
 creating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems; and 
 achieving revenue growth. 
 If these risks are not appropriately managed, we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or incur unanticipated liabilities, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, in connection with our acquisitions, we may be required to issue common stock, which would dilute our existing shareholders, or incur additional debt, which would increase our operating costs and potentially strain our liquidity. Moreover, acquisitions 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 could lead to increases in amortization expenses, impairments of goodwill and purchased long-lived assets or restructuring charges, any of which could materially harm our financial condition or results. 
 Acquisitions give rise to unforeseen issues. Acquisitions involve considerable risk, including the potential disruption of each company s ongoing business and the distraction of their respective management teams, unanticipated expenses and unforeseen liabilities. Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or incur unanticipated liabilities, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 From time to time, we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated. Such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time, as well as out-of-pocket costs. 
 The consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial results. If we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash, we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any acquisition. To the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock, including options or other rights, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease. In addition, acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt, large non-recurring write-offs, such as of acquired in-process research and development costs, and restructuring charges. 
 We depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Competition for key personnel and other highly qualified management, sales, trading, compliance and technical personnel is significant. It is possible that we will be unable to retain our key personnel and to attract, assimilate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel or the inability to identify, hire, train and retain other qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 From time to time, other companies in the financial sector have experienced losses of sales and trading professionals. The level of competition to attract these professionals is intense. It is possible that we will lose professionals due to increased competition or other factors in the future. The loss of a sales and trading professional, particularly a senior professional with broad industry expertise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 
 Certain provisions of Delaware law and our charter may adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock and make a takeover of us more difficult. We are organized under the laws of the State of Delaware. Certain provisions of Delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. In addition, certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have anti-takeover effects and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in its best interest. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the board to determine the terms of our unissued series of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares of any series of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders. As a result, the board can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock. In addition, the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, because the rights given to the holders of a series of preferred stock may prohibit a merger, reorganization, sale, liquidation or other extraordinary corporate transaction.

 Throughout this document, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms Company , we , us and our refer to StoneX Group Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, including adverse changes in economic, political and market conditions, losses from our market-making and trading activities arising from counterparty failures and changes in market conditions, the loss of key personnel, the impact of increasing competition, the impact of changes in government regulation, the possibility of liabilities arising from violations of foreign, United States U.S. federal and U.S. state securities laws, the impact of changes in technology in the securities and commodities trading industries and the potential impact of public health emergencies, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations, results of operations, financial condition, workforce or the operations or decisions of our clients, suppliers or business customers. Although we believe that our forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions regarding our business and future market conditions, there can be no assurances that our actual results will not differ materially from any results expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

 Current Trends Affecting the Financial Services Industry 
 Economic and financial market conditions, including conditions impacted by public health emergencies, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the recent banking crisis (such as the closure of Silicon Valley Bank, receiverships of First Republic Bank and Signature Bank, and acquisition of Credit Suisse Group AG), and geopolitical events such as terrorism, the Israel-Hamas war and escalating tensions in the Middle East, the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia and related sanctions imposed by the U.S. Department of Treasury and other governing bodies in countries in which we conduct business, have created significant market volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. While increased volatility is typically a driver of increased client activity and growth in our operating revenues, longer periods of extreme volatility and dislocation in global securities, foreign exchange and commodity markets may affect our ability to establish effective offsetting positions in our principal trading and market-making activities which may expose us to trading losses. In addition, in the event that a global recession or slowdown occurs, this could lead to extended periods of low short-term interest rates and decreased volatility which could adversely affect our profitability. We also may be exposed to increased counterparty default, liquidity and credit risks with respect to our client accounts, which means if our clients experience losses in excess of the funds they have deposited with us, we may not be able to recover the negative balance from our clients. In these circumstances, we may nonetheless be required to fund positions with counterparties using our own funds, which in turn would reduce our liquidity buffers. If any of these risks materialize, our operating results or ability to conduct our business may be materially adversely affected.

 In addition, the recent COVID-19 pandemic led to increased operational and cybersecurity risks and it or similar events may again do so in the future. These risks have included, among others, increased demand on our information technology resources and systems and the increased risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks. In the event of a significant COVID-19 resurgence or the emergence of a similar event in the future, any failure to effectively manage these increased operational and cybersecurity demands and risks may materially adversely affect our results of operations and the ability to conduct our business. For a further discussion of cybersecurity risks, see Technology and Cybersecurity Risks below. 
 See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A in this Form 10-K for a discussion of other risks that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Executive Summary 
 Our fiscal 2023 was marked by the effects of heightened inflationary pressures, the tightening of monetary policy in most major markets around the world and the resulting significant increase in short term interest rates. Geopolitical uncertainty remained throughout the year, however market volatility has generally declined since the Russian invasion of the Ukraine in the prior year. Against this backdrop, we experienced a tightening of spreads across all of our products with the exception of global payments. However, through continued client engagement and onboarding, as well as expansion of our product offering we grew transactional volumes in all products, with the exception of FX/CFD contracts. 
 In fiscal 2023 we continued to experience strong growth in our listed derivative client balances, which increased 1,441 million to 7,137 million, while average money-market/FDIC sweep balances decreased 446 million to 1,338 million. The overall increase in client balances, combined with the significant increase in short term interest rates compared to the prior year, led to an increase in interest and fee income on client balances of 295.4 million, or 331 , to 384.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. 
 Operating revenues increased 806.7 million, or 38 , to 2,914.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 2,107.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, led by our Commercial and Institutional segments which added 170.6 million and 681.8 million, respectively, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Our Global Payments segments added 40.6 million, while our Retail segment experienced a 93.7 million decline, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. 
 Overall segment income increased 87.8 million, or 13 , compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. The growth in segment income was led by our Commercial segment which increased 102.4 million, or 36 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Institutional and Global Payments segment income increased 43.3 million and 11.7 million, respectively, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. This growth was partially tempered by a 69.6 million decline in Retail segment income compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. 
 The significant increase in short term interest rates during fiscal 2023 drove an increase in interest expense paid on client balances of 131.5 million, to 148.9 million, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Interest expense related to corporate funding purposes increased 12.8 million to 57.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 44.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. 
 On the expense side, we continue to focus on maintaining our variable cost model and limiting the growth of our non-variable 
 expenses. In fiscal 2023, variable expenses were 52 of total expenses compared to 56 in the prior year. Non-variable expenses, excluding bad debts increased 112.5 million compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, principally due to higher fixed compensation and benefits, non-trading technology and support, travel and business development, trading system and market information, and depreciation and amortization. 
 Net income increased 31.4 million to 238.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 207.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Diluted earnings per share were 11.18 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 10.01 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.

 Selected Summary Financial Information 
 Results of Operations 
 Our total revenues, as reported, combine gross revenues for the physical commodities business and net revenues for all other businesses. Management believes that operating revenues, which deduct the cost of sales of physical commodities from total revenues, is a more useful financial measure with which to assess our results of operations. The table below sets forth our operating revenues, as well as other key financial measures, for the periods indicated.

 Operating Revenues 
 Year Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2022 
 Operating revenues from listed derivatives declined 14.0 million, or 3 , to 416.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 430.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, principally resulting from a 4 decline in the average rate per contract. 
 Operating revenues in OTC derivatives increased 23.9 million, or 11 , to 232.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 208.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. This growth was principally driven by a 20 increase in OTC contract volumes, partially offset by a 7 decline in the average rate per contract. 
 Operating revenue from securities transactions increased 453.6 million, or 74 , to 1,064.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 610.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. This increase was principally due to a 52 increase in securities ADV, as well as a significant increase in interest rates. Carried interest on fixed income securities is a component of operating revenues, however interest expense associated with financing these positions is not. As a result of the significant increase in short-term interest rates, we have amended our calculation of securities RPM, in the table above, to present the RPM after deducting from operating revenues the interest expense associated with our fixed income activities. Net operating revenues derived from securities transactions decreased 39.3 million, or 11 , to 325.6 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 364.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2022. This decline principally resulted from the 40 decline in RPM principally due to a tightening of spreads and a change in product mix.

 Operating revenues from FX/CFD contracts declined 77.4 million, or 23 , to 261.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 339.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, principally as a result of a 10 decline in FX/CFD contracts ADV, as well as a 12 decline in FX/CFD contracts RPM. 
 Operating revenues from global payments increased by 40.5 million, or 24 , to 208.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 167.8 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, principally as a result of an 8 increase in ADV, as well as a 14 increase in payments RPM. 
 Operating revenues from physical contracts increased 50.6 million, or 26 , to 244.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 194.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, principally due to increased client activity in agricultural and energy commodities, including the CDI acquisition effective October 31, 2022. 
 Interest and fee income earned on client balances, which is associated with our listed and OTC derivative businesses, as well as our correspondent clearing and independent wealth management businesses, increased 295.4 million, or 331 , to 384.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 89.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, principally as a result of the impact of the significant increase in short-term interest rates, as well as a 25 increase in average client equity, which was partially offset by a 25 decline in average money market/FDIC sweep client balances. 
 
 Year Ended September 30, 2022 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2021 
 Operating revenues increased 434.3 million, or 26 , to 2,107.4 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 1,673.1 million in the year ended September 30, 2021. The table above displays operating revenues disaggregated across the key products we provide to our clients. 
 Operating revenues derived from listed derivatives increased 42.9 million, or 11 , to 430.5 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 387.6 million in the year ended September 30, 2021, principally driven by a 10 increase in listed derivative volumes. 
 Operating revenues in OTC derivatives increased 64.9 million, or 45 , to 208.3 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 143.4 million in the year ended September 30, 2021. This growth was principally driven by increased client activity in agricultural and soft commodity markets which resulted in a 16 increase in OTC contract volumes, as well as a 27 increase in the average rate per contract as a result of wider spreads in FX hedging and energy and renewable fuels markets. 
 Operating revenue from securities transactions increased 76.8 million, or 14 , to 610.4 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 533.6 million in the year ended September 30, 2021. This increase was principally a result of a 25 increase in securities ADV driven by increased client activity in fixed income markets, which was partially offset by a 15 decline in RPM as a result of lower spreads in equity products. 
 Operating revenues from FX/CFD contracts increased 97.3 million, or 40 , to 339.3 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 242.0 million in the year ended September 30, 2021, principally as a result of a 25 increase in FX/CFD contracts ADV, as well as a 11 increase in FX/CFD contracts RPM, both of which were driven by heightened volatility in global financial markets. 
 Operating revenues from global payments increased by 34.0 million, or 25 , to 167.8 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 133.8 million in the year ended September 30, 2021, principally as a result of a 15 increase in ADV, as well as a 10 increase in payments RPM. 
 Operating revenues from physical contracts increased 41.7 million, or 27 , to 194.3 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 152.6 million in the year ended September 30, 2021, principally due to increased client activity in agricultural and energy commodities, as well as continued strong client demand for precious metals. 
 Interest and fee income earned on client balances, which is associated with our listed and OTC derivative businesses, as well as our correspondent clearing and independent wealth management businesses, increased 63.3 million, or 243 , to 89.3 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 26.0 million in the year ended September 30, 2021, principally as a result of an increase in short term interest rates as well as increases in average client equity and average FDIC sweep client balances of 48 and 21 , respectively.

 Interest and Transactional Expenses 
 Year Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2022 
 Transaction-based clearing expenses 
 Year Ended September 30, 2023 2022 Change Change Transaction-based clearing expenses 271.8 291.2 (19.4) (7) Percentage of operating revenues 9 14 
 The decrease in transaction-based clearing expense was principally due to lower ADR conversion and short-rebate fees in the Equity Capital Markets business, lower bank fees and transactional regulatory fees in the Retail Forex business, which related vendor optimization and decreased FX/CFD ADV, respectively, lower fees in the Exchange-Traded Futures Options business, principally related to a decrease in contracts traded, and lower fees in the Global Payments business. These decreases were partially offset by higher fees in the Debt Capital Markets business, due to an increase in the ADV and higher exchange fees in the Financial Ag Energy and LME Metals businesses, due to an increase in exchange-traded volumes. The decline in the percentage of operating revenues was principally due to the impact of the significant increase in interest income on operating revenues. 
 Introducing broker commissions 
 Year Ended September 30, 2023 2022 Change Change Introducing broker commissions 161.6 160.1 1.5 1 Percentage of operating revenues 6 8 
 Introducing broker commission expense increased modestly period-over-period. Higher costs in our Physical Ag Energy business, related to incremental expense from the CDI acquisition, effective October 31, 2022, Financial Ag Energy, Asset Management and Global Payments businesses were partially offset by decreased expenses in our Independent Wealth Management and Retail Forex businesses, principally due to lower trading volumes and revenues. The decline in the percentage of operating revenues was principally due to the impact of the significant increase in interest income on operating revenues. 
 Interest expense 
 Year Ended September 30, 2023 2022 Change Change Interest expense attributable to: Trading activities: Institutional dealer in fixed income securities 556.7 62.3 494.4 794 Securities borrowing 39.4 23.0 16.4 71 Client balances on deposit 148.9 17.4 131.5 756 Short-term financing facilities of subsidiaries and other direct interest of operating segments 57.2 32.8 24.4 74 802.2 135.5 666.7 492 Corporate funding 57.5 44.7 12.8 29 Total interest expense 859.7 180.2 679.5 377 
 The increase in interest expense attributable to trading activities was principally due to the significant increase in short-term interest rates, an increase in ADV in our fixed income business, and an increase in client balances on which we pay interest. The increase in interest expense attributable to corporate funding was principally due to higher short-term interest rates on our revolving credit facility as well as an increase in average borrowings.

 Year Ended September 30, 2022 2021 Change Change Transaction-based clearing expenses 291.2 271.7 19.5 7 Percentage of operating revenues 14 16 
 The increase in expense was principally due to higher clearing and ADR conversion fees in the Equity Capital Markets business, higher costs related to listed derivatives within the Financial Ag Energy and Exchange-Traded Futures Options businesses, and higher costs in our Debt Capital Markets, Global Payments, and Retail Forex businesses due to increased average daily volumes. The decline in the percentage of operating revenues was principally due to the increase in interest income. 
 Introducing broker commissions 
 Year Ended September 30, 2022 2021 Change Change Introducing broker commissions 160.1 160.5 (0.4) Percentage of operating revenues 8 10 
 The modest decrease in introducing broker commissions was principally due to lower costs within our Financial Ag Energy and Retail Forex businesses, partially offset by increased activity in our Exchange-Traded Futures Options, LME Metals, Physical Ag Energy and Global Payments businesses. The decline in the percentage of operating revenues was principally due to the increase in interest income. 
 Interest expense

 The increase in interest expense attributable to trading activities was principally due to the increase in fixed income business activities within our Institutional segment, increased interest on client balances principally due to higher short-term rates, and increased average borrowings within our Commercial segment, along with the impact of the increases in short-term interest rates. 
 
 Net Operating Revenues 
 Net operating revenues is one of the key measures used by management to assess the performance of our operating segments. Net operating revenue is calculated as operating revenue less transaction-based clearing expenses, introducing broker commissions and interest expense. Transaction-based clearing expenses represent variable expenses paid to executing brokers, exchanges, clearing organizations and banks in relation to our transactional volumes. Introducing broker commissions include commission paid to non-employee third parties that have introduced clients to us. Net operating revenues represent revenues available to pay variable compensation to risk management consultants and traders and direct non-variable expenses, as well as variable and non-variable expenses of operational and administrative employees, including our executive management team.

 Year Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2022 
 Compensation and Other Expenses: Compensation and other expenses increased 118.3 million, or 10 , to 1,323.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 1,205.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. 
 Compensation and Benefits: 
 Year Ended September 30, (in millions) 2023 2022 Change Change Compensation and benefits: Variable compensation and benefits Front office 407.3 410.4 (3.1) (1) Administrative, executive, and centralized and local operations 75.9 67.7 8.2 12 Total variable compensation and benefits 483.2 478.1 5.1 1 Variable compensation and benefits as a percentage of net operating revenues 30 32 Fixed compensation and benefits: Non-variable salaries 266.8 225.8 41.0 18 Employee benefits and other compensation, excluding share-based compensation 90.6 73.1 17.5 24 Share-based compensation 28.0 17.8 10.2 57 Total fixed compensation and benefits 385.4 316.7 68.7 22 Total compensation and benefits 868.6 794.8 73.8 9 Total compensation and benefits as a percentage of operating revenues 30 38 Number of employees, end of period 4,137 3,615 522 14 
 Non-variable salaries increased principally due to the increase in headcount resulting from expanding capabilities among our business lines and the CDI acquisition, as well as the growth in our operational and overhead departments supporting our business growth, as well as the impact of annual merit increases. 
 Employee benefits and other compensation, excluding share-based compensation, increased principally related to higher severance, payroll taxes, benefits, and retirement costs. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, severance costs were 14.9 million, principally related to a reorganization within the Global Payments business. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, severance costs were 2.6 million. Partially offsetting the increases was an increase in employee-elected deferred incentive, which is exchanged for restricted stock that will be amortized over a thirty-six month period following the grant date. Share-based compensation, which contains stock option and restricted stock expense, increased principally due to higher employee participation in the Company s restricted stock plan, as well as from 3.3 million in accelerated share-based compensation for employee departures related to retirements and certain business reorganizations during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other Expenses: Other non-compensation expenses increased 44.5 million, or 11 , to 454.8 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 410.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. 
 Trading systems and market information costs increased 7.8 million, principally due to higher market information costs in the Debt Capital Markets, Retail Forex, and Financial Ag Energy businesses. 
 Non-trading technology and support increased 9.2 million, principally due to higher non-trading software maintenance and support costs related to various IT systems primarily within our Core IT and other overhead departments. 
 Occupancy and equipment rental costs increased 4.3 million, principally due to increases in costs in London and Singapore, as well as incremental costs from the CDI acquisition. 
 Travel and business development increased 7.9 million, principally due to higher transportation and lodging costs across all business lines and support departments following periods of reduced travel. 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 6.6 million, principally due to the incremental depreciation expense from internally developed software placed into service. 
 Bad debt expense, net of recoveries increased 0.7 million over the prior year. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, bad debt expense, net of recovery was 16.5 million, principally related to bad debt expense of 15.1 million of client receivables in the Physical Ag Energy business, 2.3 million of client trading account deficits in our Retail FX segment, and 0.6 million in client trading account deficits in our Financial Ag Energy business, partially offset by net recoveries of 1.4 million of client trading account deficits in our Exchange-traded Futures Options business. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, bad debt expense, net of recoveries was 15.8 million, principally related to client trading account deficits

 in our Commercial, Institutional, Retail, and Global Payments segments of 11.6 million, 1.8 million, 2.3 million, and 0.1 million, respectively. 
 Gain on Acquisition and Other Gains, net: The results of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 include a nonrecurring gain of 23.5 million related to the CDI acquisition, as well as a nonrecurring gain related to proceeds received of 2.1 million resulting from an institutional-based foreign exchange antitrust class action settlement. The results of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 included a nonrecurring gain related to proceeds received of 6.4 million resulting from a foreign exchange antitrust class action settlement in our Retail segment. 
 Provision for Taxes: Our effective income tax rate was 26 and 25 for fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 due to U.S. state and local taxes, changes in valuation allowances, U.K. bank tax, U.S. permanent differences, and the amount of foreign earnings taxed at higher tax rates. The gain on acquisition of 23.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 was not taxable and reduced the effective income tax rate 1.4 . 
 
 Year Ended September 30, 2022 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2021 
 Compensation and Other Expenses: Compensation and other expenses increased 205.8 million, or 21 , to 1,205.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 999.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. 
 Compensation and Benefits: 
 Year Ended September 30, (in millions) 2022 2021 Change Change Compensation and benefits: Variable compensation and benefits Front office 410.4 333.5 76.9 23 Administrative, executive, and centralized and local operations 67.7 44.2 23.5 53 Total variable compensation and benefits 478.1 377.7 100.4 27 Variable compensation and benefits as a percentage of net operating revenues 32 33 Fixed compensation and benefits: Non-variable salaries 225.8 204.7 21.1 10 Employee benefits and other compensation, excluding share-based compensation 73.1 82.8 (9.7) (12) Share-based compensation 17.8 13.9 3.9 28 Total fixed compensation and benefits 316.7 301.4 15.3 5 Total compensation and benefits 794.8 679.1 115.7 17 Total compensation and benefits as a percentage of operating revenues 38 41 Number of employees, end of period 3,615 3,242 373 12 
 Non-variable salaries increased principally due to increased headcount resulting from expanded capabilities among our business lines, as well as the growth in our operational and overhead departments supporting our business growth. 
 Employee benefits and other compensation, excluding share-based compensation, decreased principally due to increased employee-elected deferred incentive, which was exchanged for restricted stock that is amortized over a thirty-six month period following the grant date and lower severance costs, partially offset by higher payroll, benefits, and retirement costs from the increased headcount. During the year ended September 30, 2022, severance costs were 2.6 million. During the year ended September 30, 2021, severance costs were 7.7 million, principally due to the departure of certain senior officers. Share-based compensation included stock option and restricted stock expense. 
 Other Expenses: Other non-compensation expenses increased 90.1 million, or 28 , to 410.3 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 320.2 million in the year ended September 30, 2021. 
 Trading systems and market information costs increased 7.4 million, principally due to higher costs in the Retail Forex, Debt Capital Markets, and LME Metals businesses. 
 Professional fees increased 13.4 million , principally due to higher legal and other consulting fees. 
 Non-trading technology and support increased 6.4 million, principally due to higher non-trading software implementation costs related to various IT systems. 
 Selling and marketing costs increased 22.0 million, principally due to increased campaigns related to our Retail Forex business, as well as costs of holding our bi-annual global sales and strategy meeting in March 2022.

 Travel and business development increased 12.4 million principally due to several business line specific development meetings, as well as increases along all business lines with the lifting of certain social distancing and travel restrictions, following periods of limited travel due to responses by governments and societies to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 7.9 million, principally due to the incremental depreciation expense from internally developed software placed into service. 
 Other expenses increased 14.3 million, principally due to higher insurance costs, non-income taxes, non-variable direct business related costs, and non-compensation employee based expenses. 
 Bad debt expense, net of recoveries increased 5.4 million over the prior year. During the year ended September 30, 2022, bad debt expense, net of recovery was 15.8 million, principally related to client trading account deficits in our Commercial, Institutional, Retail, and Global Payments segments of 11.6 million, 1.8 million, 2.3 million, and 0.1 million, respectively. During the year ended September 30, 2021, bad debts, net of recoveries were 10.4 million, principally related to client trading account deficits in our Commercial, Institutional, and Retail segments of 3.4 million, 0.6 million, and 1.1 million, respectively. Additionally, we recorded bad debt expense of 5.1 million related to trade receivables with physical clients. 
 Gain on Acquisitions and Other Gains, net: The results of the year ended September 30, 2022 include a nonrecurring gain of 6.4 million related to a foreign exchange antitrust class action settlement received in March 2022. The results of the year ended September 30, 2021 included a gain of 3.3 million related to an adjustment to the liabilities assumed as part of the Gain acquisition initially determined values, as of August 1, 2020. 
 Provision for Taxes: The effective income tax rate was 25 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. The effective income tax rate for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 due to U.S. state and local taxes, changes in valuation allowances, U.K. bank tax, U.S. permanent differences, and the amount of foreign earnings taxed at higher tax rates. The gain on acquisition of 3.3 million in the year ended September 30, 2021 was not taxable and reduced the effective income tax rate 0.5 . 
 
 Variable vs. Fixed Expenses 
 The table below presents our variable expenses and non-variable expenses as a percentage of total non-interest expenses for the periods indicted. 
 Year Ended September 30, (in millions) 2023 of Total 2022 of Total 2021 of Total Variable compensation and benefits 483.2 28 478.1 29 377.7 26 Transaction-based clearing expenses 271.8 15 291.2 17 271.7 19 Introducing broker commissions 161.6 9 160.1 10 160.5 11 Total variable expenses 916.6 52 929.4 56 809.9 56 Fixed compensation and benefits 385.4 22 316.7 19 301.4 21 Other fixed expenses 438.3 25 394.5 24 309.8 22 Bad debts, net of recoveries 16.5 1 15.8 1 10.4 1 Total non-variable expenses 840.2 48 727.0 44 621.6 44 Total non-interest expenses 1,756.8 100 1,656.4 100 1,431.5 100 
 Our variable expenses include variable compensation paid to traders and risk management consultants, bonuses paid to operational, administrative, and executive employees, transaction-based clearing expenses and introducing broker commissions. We seek to make our non-interest expenses variable to the greatest extent possible, and to keep our fixed costs as low as possible. 
 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, non-variable expenses, excluding bad debts, net of recoveries, increased 112.5 million, or 16 , compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. 
 During the year ended September 30, 2022, non-variable expenses, excluding bad debts, net of recoveries, increased 100.0 million, or 16 , compared to the year ended September 30, 2021. 
 
 Segment Information 
 Our operating segments are based principally on the nature of the clients we serve (commercial, institutional, and retail), and a fourth operating segment, our global payments business. We manage our business in this manner due to our large global footprint, in which we have more than 4,000 employees allowing us to serve clients in more than 180 countries. 
 Our business activities are managed as operating segments, which are our reportable segments for financial reporting purposes, as shown below.

 Operating revenues, net operating revenues, net contribution and segment income are some of the key measures used by management to assess the performance of each segment and for decisions regarding the allocation of our resources. Operating revenues are calculated as total revenues less cost of sales of physical commodities. 
 Net operating revenue is calculated as operating revenue less transaction-based clearing expenses, introducing broker commissions and interest expense. 
 Net contribution is calculated as net operating revenues less variable compensation. Variable compensation paid to risk management consultants and traders generally represents a fixed percentage, that can vary by revenue type, of an amount equal to revenues generated, and in some cases, revenues generated less transaction-based clearing expenses, base salaries and an overhead allocation. 
 Segment income is calculated as net contribution less non-variable direct segment costs. These non-variable direct expenses include trader base compensation and benefits, operational charges, trading systems and market information, professional fees, travel and business development, communications, bad debts, trade errors and direct marketing expenses.

 Year Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2022 
 Operating revenues increased 170.6 million, or 25 , to 862.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 692.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Net operating revenues increased 134.8 million, or 23 , to 721.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 586.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. 
 Operating revenues derived from listed derivatives declined 10.0 million, or 4 , to 230.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 240.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. This decline was principally driven by a 16 decline in the average rate per contract as the prior year period experienced wider spreads in LME markets related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting effect on base metal commodity prices. This decline was partially offset by a 14 increase in listed derivative contract volumes compared to the prior year period. 
 Operating revenues derived from OTC transactions increased 23.9 million, or 11 , to 232.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 208.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. This increase was principally 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 driven by a 20 increase in OTC volumes, most notably in agricultural and soft commodities, which was partially offset by a 7 decline in the average rate per contract compared to the prior year. 
 Operating revenues derived from physical transactions increased 52.5 million, or 29 , to 232.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 180.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, principally due to the CDI acquisition, effective October 31, 2022, as well as increased client activity in agricultural and energy commodities. 
 Interest and fee income earned on client balances increased 100.9 million, or 244 , to 142.2 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 41.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, as a result of a significant increase in short-term interest rates, which was partially offset by a 10 decrease in average client equity to 1,927 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. 
 Variable expenses, excluding interest, expressed as a percentage of operating revenues declined to 32 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 37 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, primarily as the result of the increase in interest/fees earned on client balances, which is generally not a component of variable compensation. 
 Segment income increased 102.4 million, or 36 , to 390.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 288.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, principally due to the growth in operating revenues which was partially offset by a 27.2 million increase in non-variable direct expenses. The increase in non-variable direct expenses was primarily due to a 11.3 million increase in fixed compensation and benefits, a 4.1 million increase in bad debts, net of recoveries, a 2.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization, a 2.7 million increase in travel and business development and a 2.2 million increase in selling and marketing expense. 
 Year Ended September 30, 2022 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2021 
 Operating revenues increased 157.3 million, or 29 , to 692.1 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 534.8 million in the year ended September 30, 2021. Net operating revenues increased 153.4 million, or 35 , to 586.5 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 433.1 million in the year ended September 30, 2021. 
 Operating revenues derived from listed derivatives increased 17.0 million, or 8 , to 240.5 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 223.5 million in the year ended September 30, 2021. This increase was principally driven by a 9 increase in the average rate per contract as a result of wider spreads in LME commodity markets which was partially offset by a 2 decrease in contract volumes as a result of decline in agricultural and soft commodity client volumes. 
 Operating revenues derived from OTC transactions increased 64.9 million, or 45 , to 208.3 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 143.4 million in the year ended September 30, 2021. This increase was driven by a 16 increase in OTC volumes, primarily in agricultural and soft commodities as well as a 27 increase in the average rate per contract as a result of wider spreads in FX hedging and energy and renewable fuels markets. 
 Operating revenues derived from physical transactions increased 48.2 million, or 36 , to 180.4 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 132.2 million in the year ended September 30, 2021, principally due to increased client activity in agricultural and energy commodities as well as continued strong client demand for precious metals. Operating revenues during the year ended September 30, 2022 were favorably impacted by realized gains of 1.7 million on the sale of physical inventories carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value, for which losses on related derivative positions were recognized in prior periods. Operating revenues during the year ended September 30, 2021 included unrealized losses on derivative positions held against physical inventories carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value of 2.2 million, and sold in subsequent quarters. In addition, the year ended September 30, 2021 included a 1.9 million loss on the liquidation of certain physical inventories of crude oil and low sulfur fuel oil as a result of quality degradation and additional costs to sell. 
 Interest and fee income earned on client balances increased 26.7 million, or 183 , to 41.3 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 14.6 million in the year ended September 30, 2022, as result of both a 30 increase in average client equity to 2,149 million as well as an increase in short term interest rates. 
 Variable expenses, excluding interest, expressed as a percentage of operating revenues declined to 37 in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 42 in the year ended September 30, 2021, primarily as the result of the increase in interest income. 
 Segment income increased 96.1 million, or 50 , to 288.3 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 192.2 million in the year ended September 30, 2021, principally driven by the growth in operating revenues which was partially offset by a 16.5 million increase in other fixed expenses and a 3.1 million increase in bad debts, net of recoveries and impairment. The increase in other fixed expenses principally related to a 4.0 million increase in shared service allocations, a 3.2 million increase in travel and business development, a 2.8 million increase in professional fees, a 1.9 million increase in insurance expense and a 1.5 million increase in selling and marketing.

 Year Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2022 
 Operating revenues increased 681.8 million, or 82 , to 1,513.6 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 831.8 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Net operating revenues increased 48.5 million, or 10 , to 532.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 483.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. 
 Operating revenues derived from listed derivatives declined 4.0 million, or 2 , to 186.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 190.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, principally driven by a 3 decline in listed derivative contract volumes as the average rate per contract was flat compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. 
 Operating revenues derived from securities transactions increased 460.2 million, or 90 , to 973.6 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 513.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. The ADV of securities traded increased 52 , principally driven by increased client activity in both equity and fixed income markets. Carried interest on fixed income securities is a component of operating revenues, however interest expense associated with financing these positions is not. As a result of the significant increase in short-term interest rates, we have amended our calculation of the securities RPM, in the table above, to present the RPM after deducting from operating revenues the interest expense associated with our fixed income activities. The securities RPM decreased 40 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, principally due to a tightening of spreads and a change in product mix. 
 Operating revenues derived from FX contracts increased 11.0 million, or 39 , to 39.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 28.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, primarily driven by a 8 increase in the ADV of FX contracts traded as well as a 32 increase in the average rate per contract. 
 Finally, interest and fee income earned on client balances, which is associated with our listed derivative business, as well as our correspondent clearing businesses, increased 193.4 million, to 239.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 46.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, principally driven by a significant increase in short-term interest rates, as well as a 47 increase in average client equity compared to the prior year period, which was partially offset by a 25 decline in average money market / FDIC sweep client balances. 
 As a result of the increase in short-term interest rates and the increase in the ADV, interest expense increased 644.1 million, to 758.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 114.2 million the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, with interest expense directly associated with serving as an institutional dealer in fixed income securities increasing 494.4 million, interest paid to clients increasing 117.7 million and interest expense directly attributable to securities lending activities increasing 16.4 million compared to the prior year period. 
 Variable expenses, excluding interest, expressed as a percentage of operating revenues declined to 27 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 51 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, principally as the result of the increase in interest/fees earned on client balances, which is generally not a component of variable compensation. 
 Segment income increased 43.3 million, or 25 , to 217.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 174.6 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, primarily as a result of the increase in net operating revenues noted above, as well as a 2.1 million foreign exchange antitrust class action settlement received in our institutional foreign exchange prime brokerage business. The increase in net operating revenues was partially offset by a 15.2 million, or 13 increase in non-variable direct expenses versus the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. The increase in non-variable direct expenses was primarily related to a 8.4 million increase in fixed compensation and benefits, a 3.8 million increase in trade systems and market information, a 2.4 million increase in non-trading technology and support, a 1.5 million increase in professional fees and a 1.9 million increase in travel and business development. These increases were partially offset by a 3.3 million positive variance in bad debts, net of recoveries compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Segment income was also favorably impacted by a nonrecurring gain related to proceeds received of 2.1 million resulting from an institutional-based foreign exchange antitrust class action settlement. 
 Year Ended September 30, 2022 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2021 
 Operating revenues increased 163.4 million, or 24 , to 831.8 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 668.4 million in the year ended September 30, 2021. Net operating revenues increased 64.1 million, or 15 , to 483.5 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 419.4 million in the year ended September 30, 2021. 
 Operating revenues derived from listed derivatives increased 25.9 million, or 16 , to 190.0 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 164.1 million in the year ended September 30, 2021, principally driven by a 13 increase in listed derivative contract volumes compared to the year ended September 30, 2021, as a result of both an increase in market volatility as well as an increase in the number of clients in this business. This was partially offset by a 1 decline in the average rate per contract in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to the year ended September 30, 2021.

 Operating revenues derived from securities transactions increased 77.4 million, or 18 , to 513.4 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 436.0 million in the year ended September 30, 2021. The ADV of securities traded increased 25 , principally driven by increased client activity in fixed income markets and to a lesser extent equity products. The RPM traded declined 15 in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to the year ended September 30, 2021. 
 Operating revenues derived from FX contracts increased 12.3 million, or 76 , to 28.4 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 16.1 million in the year ended September 30, 2021, primarily driven by a 142 increase in the ADV of FX contracts traded as a result of heightened volatility in global FX markets. The effect of the increase in ADV was partially offset by a 26 decline in the average rate per contract due to changes in product and client mix. 
 Finally, interest and fee income earned on client balances, which is associated with our listed derivative business, as well as our correspondent clearing and independent wealth management businesses, increased 35.9 million, or 352 , to 46.1 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 10.2 million in the year ended September 30, 2021, as result of a 62 increase in average client equity and a 21 increase in average FDIC sweep client balances combined with a significant increase in short term interest rates. 
 As a result of the increase in short term interest rates and the increase in ADV, interest expense increased 205 compared to the prior year, with interest expense directly associated with serving as an institutional dealer in fixed income securities increasing 52.7 million, interest paid to clients increasing 14.5 million and interest expense directly attributable to securities lending activities increasing 5.4 million compared to the prior year period. 
 Variable expenses, excluding interest, expressed as a percentage of operating revenues declined to 51 in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 55 in the year ended September 30, 2021, primarily as the result of the increase in interest income. 
 Segment income increased 6.9 million, or 4 , to 174.6 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 167.7 million in the year ended September 30, 2021, primarily as a result of the increase in net operating revenues noted above, which was partially offset by a 26.1 million, or 28 increase in non-variable direct expenses, excluding bad debts versus the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in non-variable direct expenses, excluding bad debts was primarily related to a 5.2 million increase in fixed compensation and benefits, a 3.9 million increase in trade systems and market information, a 6.2 million increase in professional fees and a 3.0 million increase in travel and business development.

Net operating revenues decreased 75.6 million, or 25 , to 227.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 302.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. 
 Operating revenues derived from FX/CFD contracts declined 88.4 million, or 28 , to 222.5 million, primarily as a result of 11 and 18 declines in RPM and FX/CFD contracts ADV, respectively, compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. These declines were principally driven by diminished volatility and tighter trading ranges in our larger volume markets which resulted in reduced client trading activity and spread capture.

 Interest and fee income earned on client balances increased 1.1 million, or 58 , to 3.0 million primarily as a result of an increase in short-term interest rates. 
 Variable expenses, excluding interest, as a percentage of operating revenues were 34 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 34 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. 
 Segment income decreased 69.6 million, or 60 , to 45.8 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 115.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, primarily as a result of the decline in net operating revenues noted above. Non-variable direct expenses declined 4.4 million, or 3 , compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, principally driven by a 3.3 million decline in direct selling and marketing costs. The fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 included a non-recurring 6.4 million foreign exchange antitrust class action settlement received in our Retail forex business. 
 Year Ended September 30, 2022 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2021

These increases were principally driven by heightened volatility which results in increased client trading activity and spread capture. 
 Operating revenues derived from securities transactions declined 0.6 million, or 1 , to 97.0 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 97.6 million in the year ended September 30, 2021.

 Interest and fee income earned on client balances increased 0.7 million, or 58 , to 1.9 million primarily as a result of an increase in short term interest rates. 
 Variable expenses, excluding interest, as a percentage of operating revenues were 34 in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 41 in the year ended September 30, 2021, with the decrease in the variable rate percentage being driven by the strong growth in operating revenues derived from FX/CFD contracts which has a lower variable rate cost base. 
 Segment income increased 47.6 million, or 70 , to 115.4 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 67.8 million in the year ended September 30, 2021, primarily as a result of the increase in net operating revenues noted above, as well as a 6.4 million foreign exchange antitrust class action settlement received in the year ended September 30, 2022 in our Retail forex business.

 Year Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2022 
 Operating revenues increased 40.6 million, or 24 , to 212.6 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 172.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Net operating revenues increased 40.8 million, or 25 , to 203.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 162.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. 
 The increase in operating revenues was primarily driven by an 8 increase in the average daily volume, as well as a 14 increase in the RPM traded compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. 
 Variable expenses, excluding interest, expressed as a percentage of operating revenues were 23 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 24 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. 
 Segment income increased 11.7 million, or 12 , to 109.1 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 97.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily driven by the increase in net operating revenues noted above, which was partially offset by a 21.6 million increase in non-variable direct expenses. The increase in non-variable direct expenses was primarily driven by a 17.7 million increase in fixed compensation and benefits, including

 10.0 million in severance related to a reorganization of the business. This reorganization plan will include a decline in variable compensation and benefits as a percentage of operating revenues going forward. 
 Year Ended September 30, 2022 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2021 
 Operating revenues increased 34.7 million, or 25 , to 172.0 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 137.3 million in the year ended September 30, 2021. Net operating revenues increased 32.6 million, or 25 , to 162.5 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 129.9 million in the year ended September 30, 2021. 
 The increase in operating revenues was primarily driven by a 15 increase in the average daily volume as well as a 10 increase in the RPM traded compared to the year ended September 30, 2021. 
 Variable expenses, excluding interest, expressed as a percentage of operating revenues were 24 in both the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. 
 Segment income increased 18.9 million, or 24 , to 97.4 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 78.5 million in the year ended September 30, 2021. This increase primarily resulted from the increase in net operating revenues, partially offset by a 8.6 million increase in non-variable direct expenses versus the prior year period, which includes a 4.2 million increase in fixed compensation and benefits, a 1.2 million increase in travel and business development and a 0.7 million increase in non-trading technology and support. 
 
 Unallocated Costs and Expenses 
 The following table is a breakout of our unallocated costs and expenses from the total costs and expenses shown above. The unallocated costs and expenses include certain shared services such as information technology, accounting and treasury, credit and risk, legal and compliance, and human resources and other activities. 
 Year Ended September 30, (in millions) 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Compensation and benefits: Variable compensation and benefits 67.6 14 59.5 58 37.6 Fixed compensation and benefits 156.4 31 119.2 119.1 224.0 25 178.7 14 156.7 Other expenses: Occupancy and equipment rental 39.4 10 35.7 8 33.1 Non-trading technology and support 43.1 13 38.3 20 31.8 Professional fees 26.3 1 26.1 13 23.0 Depreciation and amortization 22.6 4 21.7 14 19.0 Communications 6.6 20 5.5 (15) 6.5 Selling and marketing 4.4 (24) 5.8 241 1.7 Trading systems and market information 7.7 67 4.6 10 4.2 Travel and business development 5.5 38 4.0 208 1.3 Other 21.3 15 18.6 (21) 23.4 176.9 10 160.3 11 144.0 Total compensation and other expenses 400.9 18 339.0 13 300.7 
 Year Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2022 
 Total unallocated costs and other expenses increased 61.9 million, or 18 , to 400.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 339.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Compensation and benefits increased 45.3 million, or 25 , to 224.0 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 178.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. 
 The increase in variable and non-variable compensation is partially related to the move of certain client engagement teams out of discrete business lines and into shared services, and replacing compensation expense in those discrete business lines with a non-variable charge. Additionally, the increase in non-variable compensation is partially a result of hiring among our compliance and IT departments, principally due to company growth, and within the accounting department, principally due to the CDI acquisition. 
 Also, the increase in non-variable compensation is related to annual merit increases, as well as the acceleration of share-based compensation related to employee departures that are related to retirements and certain business reorganizations. Additionally, the increase in variable compensation is principally due to higher performance, and to a lessor extent, an increase in headcount.

 Other non-compensation expenses increased 16.6 million, or 10 , to 176.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 160.3 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 principally due to higher occupancy costs, principally related to an increase in property tax assessments in London, non-trading technology maintenance and support costs for the various systems used by the support services departments, and travel and business development costs, partially offset by lower selling and marketing costs due principally to the bi-annual global sales and strategy meeting held in March 2022. 
 Year Ended September 30, 2022 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2021 
 Total unallocated costs and other expenses increased 38.3 million, or 13 , to 339.0 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 300.7 million in the year ended September 30, 2021. Compensation and benefits increased 22.0 million, or 14 , to 178.7 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to 156.7 million in the year ended September 30, 2021. 
 During the year ended September 30, 2022, the increase in variable compensation and benefits was principally related to higher incentives driven by increased company performance over the prior year. Fixed compensation and benefits increased modestly during the year ended September 30, 2022, principally due to increased headcount, partially offset by lower severance costs. During the year ended September 30, 2022, severance costs were 0.9 million. During the year ended September 30, 2021, severance costs were 3.5 million, principally due to the departure of certain corporate senior officers. 
 During the year ended September 30, 2022, the increase in non-trading technology and support is principally due to an increase in non-trading software licensing and maintenance costs within our IT department. During the year ended September 30, 2022, the increase in selling and marketing expenses is principally due to the costs of holding our bi-annual global sales and strategy meeting in March 2022. During the year ended September 30, 2022, the increase in travel and business development is principally due to increased travel among the support functions with the lifting of certain social distancing and travel restrictions, following periods of limited travel due to responses by governments and societies to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
 Liquidity, Financial Condition and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 Liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient funding to meet all of our cash needs. Liquidity is of critical importance to us and imperative to maintaining our operations on a daily basis. Senior management establishes liquidity and capital policies, which we monitor and review for funding from both internal and external sources. We continuously evaluate how effectively our policies support our business operations. We have historically financed our liquidity and capital needs principally with funds generated from our subsidiaries' operations, issuing debt and equity securities, and accessing committed credit facilities. We plan to finance our future operating liquidity and regulatory capital needs in a manner consistent with our past practice. Liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to our Board of Directors. 
 Regulatory 
 StoneX Financial Inc. is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and is a member of both FINRA and MSRB. In addition, StoneX Financial Inc. is registered as a futures commission merchant with the CFTC and NFA, and a member of various commodities and futures exchanges in the U.S. and abroad. StoneX Financial Inc. has a responsibility to meet margin calls at all exchanges on a daily basis, and even on an intra-day basis, if deemed necessary by relevant regulators or exchanges. We require our clients to make margin deposits the next business day, and we require our largest clients to make intra-day margin payments during periods of significant price movement. Margin required to be posted to the exchanges is a function of our clients net open positions and required margin per contract. StoneX Financial Inc. is subject to minimum capital requirements under Section 4(f)(b) of the Commodity Exchange Act, Part 1.17 of the rules and regulations of the CFTC and the SEC Uniform Net Capital Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. StoneX Financial Inc. is also subject to Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Customer Protection Rule ). 
 Gain Capital Group, LLC is registered as both a futures commission merchant and registered foreign exchange dealer, subject to minimum capital requirements under Section 4(f)(b) of the Commodity Exchange Act, Part 1.17 of the rules and regulations of the CFTC and NFA Financial Requirements, Sections 1 and 11. 
 StoneX Markets LLC is a CFTC registered swap dealer, whose business is overseen by the NFA. The CFTC imposes rules over net capital requirements, as well as the exchange of initial margin between registered swap dealers and certain counterparties. 
 These rules specify the minimum amount of capital that must be available to support our clients account balances and open trading positions, including the amount of assets that StoneX Financial Inc., Gain Capital Group, LLC and StoneX Markets LLC must maintain in relatively liquid form. Further, the rules are designed to maintain general financial integrity and liquidity. 
 StoneX Financial Ltd is regulated by the FCA, the regulator of investment firms in the U.K. as a MiFID investment firm under U.K. law, and is subject to regulations which impose regulatory capital requirements. In Europe, our regulated subsidiaries are subject to E.U. regulation. Across the U.K. and E.U., the respective transpositions of the Market Abuse Regulation, and the 
 56 

Table of Contents 

 General Data Protection Regulation, also apply. StoneX Financial Ltd is a member of various commodities and futures exchanges in the U.K. and Europe and has the responsibility to meet margin calls at all exchanges on a daily basis and intra-day basis, as necessary. StoneX Financial Ltd is required to be compliant with the U.K. s MIFIDPRU regulation. To comply with these standards, we have implemented daily liquidity procedures, conduct periodic reviews of liquidity by stressed scenarios, and are required to maintain enough liquidity for the firm to survive for one year under the appropriate stressed conditions. 
 The regulations discussed above limit funds available for dividends to us. As a result, we may be unable to access our operating subsidiaries funds when we need them. 
 In our physical commodities trading, commercial hedging OTC, securities and foreign exchange trading activities, we may be required upon to meet margin calls with our various trading counterparties based upon the underlying open transactions we have in place with those counterparties. 
 We continuously review our overall credit and capital needs to ensure that our capital base, both stockholders equity and debt, as well as available credit facilities can appropriately support the anticipated financing needs of our operating subsidiaries. 
 As of September 30, 2023, we had total equity of 1,379.1 million, outstanding loans under revolving credit and other facilities of 341.0 million and 342.1 million outstanding on our senior secured notes, net of deferred financing costs. 
 A substantial portion of our assets are liquid. As of September 30, 2023, approximately 97 of our assets consisted of cash; securities purchased under agreements to resell; securities borrowed; deposits with and receivables from exchange-clearing organizations, broker-dealers, clearing organizations and counterparties; client receivables; marketable financial instruments and investments; and physical commodities inventory. All assets that are not client and counterparty deposit financed are financed by our equity capital, bank loans, short-term borrowings from financial instruments sold, not yet purchased and under repurchase agreements, securities loaned and other payables. 
 As of September 30, 2023, we had deferred tax assets totaling 45.4 million. We are required to assess the need for deferred tax asset valuation allowances at each reporting period. We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 was 12.4 million and 15.8 million, respectively. The valuation allowances as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 were primarily related to U.S. state and local, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits that, in the judgment of management, are not more likely than not to be realized. 
 
 Client and Counterparty Credit and Liquidity Risk 
 Our operations expose us to credit risk related to our clients and counterparties. The risk includes liquidity risk to the extent our clients or counterparties are unable to make timely payment of margin or other credit support. We are indirectly exposed to the financing and liquidity risks of our clients and counterparties, including the risks that our clients and counterparties may not be able to finance their operations. 
 As a clearing broker, we act on behalf of our clients for all trades consummated on exchanges. We must pay initial and variation margin to the exchanges, on a net basis, before we receive the required payments from our clients. Accordingly, we are responsible for our clients obligations with respect to these transactions, which exposes us to significant credit risk. Our clients are required to make any margin deposits the next business day, and we require our largest clients to make intra-day margin payments during periods of significant price movement. Our clients are obligated to maintain initial margin requirements at the level set by the respective exchanges, but we have the ability to increase margin requirements for clients based on their open positions, trading activity, or market conditions. 
 As it relates to OTC derivative transactions, we act as a principal, which exposes us to the credit risk of both our clients and the counterparties with which we offset our client positions. As with exchange-traded transactions, our OTC transactions require that we meet initial and variation margin payments on behalf of our clients before we receive related required payments from our clients. OTC clients are required to post sufficient collateral to meet margin requirements based on value-at-risk models as well as variation margin requirements based on the price movement of the commodity or security in which they transact. Our clients are required to make any margin deposits the next business day, and we may require our largest clients to make intra-day margin payments during periods of significant price movement. In this business as well, we have the ability to increase the margin requirements for clients based on their open positions, trading activity, or market conditions. On a limited basis, we provide credit thresholds to certain clients, based on internal evaluations and monitoring of client creditworthiness. 
 In addition, with OTC transactions, we are at risk that a counterparty will fail to meet its obligations to us when due. We would then be exposed to the risk that the settlement of a transaction which is due a client will not be collected from the respective counterparty with which the transaction was offset. We continuously monitor the credit quality of our respective counterparties and mark our positions held with each counterparty to market on a daily basis. 
 57 

Table of Contents 

 We enter into securities purchased under agreements to resell, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions to, among other things, finance financial instruments, acquire securities to cover short positions, acquire securities for settlement, and to accommodate counterparties needs. In connection with these agreements and transactions, it is our policy to receive or pledge cash or securities to adequately collateralize such agreements and transactions in accordance with general industry guidelines and practices. The collateral is valued daily and we may require counterparties to deposit additional collateral or return collateral pledged, when appropriate. 
 OptionSellers 
 In November 2018, balances in approximately 300 accounts of the FCM division of our wholly owned subsidiary, StoneX Financial Inc., declined below required maintenance margin levels and into deficit balances. All positions in these accounts, which were managed by OptionSellers.com Inc. OptionSellers ), an independent Commodity Trading Advisor CTA ), were liquidated in accordance with StoneX Financial Inc. s client agreements and obligations under market regulation standards. As of September 30, 2023, the receivable from these client accounts, net of collections and other allowable deductions was 17.2 million, with no individual account receivable exceeding 1.4 million. As of September 30, 2023, the allowance against these uncollected balances was 5.1 million. The Company is pursuing collection of the uncollected balances through arbitration proceedings against the account holders. The Company will consider developments in these proceedings, and any other relevant matters, in determining whether any changes in the allowance against the uncollected balances are required. 
 Depending on future collections and the outcomes of arbitration proceedings, any provisions for bad debts and actual losses may or may not be material to our financial results. However, we believe that the likelihood of a material adverse outcome is remote, and do not believe that any potential losses related to this matter would impact our ability to comply with our ongoing liquidity, capital, and regulatory requirements. Additional information on this matter can be found in Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Primary Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Our cash and cash equivalents and client cash and securities held for clients are held at banks, deposits at liquidity providers, investments in money market funds that invest in highly liquid investment grade securities including U.S. treasury bills, as well as investments in U.S treasury bills. In general, we believe all of our investments and deposits are of high credit quality and we have more than adequate liquidity to conduct our businesses. 
 Our assets and liabilities may vary significantly from period to period due to changing client requirements, economic and market conditions and our growth. Our total assets as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, were 21.9 billion and 19.9 billion, respectively. Our operating activities generate or utilize cash as a result of net income or loss earned or incurred during each period and fluctuations in our assets and liabilities. The most significant fluctuations arise from changes in the level of client activity, commodities prices and changes in the balances of financial instruments and commodities inventory. Certain of our subsidiaries occasionally utilize their margin line credit facilities, on a short-term basis, to meet intraday settlements with the commodity exchanges prior to collecting margin funds from their clients. 
 The majority of the assets of StoneX Financial Inc., StoneX Financial Ltd, StoneX Markets LLC, and Gain Capital Group, LLC are restricted from being transferred to us or other affiliates due to specific regulatory requirements. This restriction has no current impact on our ability to meet our cash obligations, and no such impact is expected in the future. 
 We have liquidity and funding policies and processes in place that are intended to maintain sufficient flexibility to address both company-specific and industry liquidity needs. The majority of our excess funds is held with high-quality institutions, under highly liquid reverse repurchase agreements, U.S. government obligations, interest earning cash deposits and AA-rated money market investments. 
 We do not intend to distribute earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in a taxable manner, and therefore intend to limit distributions to earnings previously taxed in the U.S., or earnings that would qualify for the 100 percent dividends received deduction, and earnings that would not result in any significant foreign taxes. We repatriated 35.5 million and 29.7 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, of earnings previously taxed in the U.S. resulting in no significant incremental taxes. Therefore, the Company has not recognized a deferred tax liability on its investment in foreign subsidiaries. 
 Senior Secured Notes 
 In June 2020, we issued 350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 8.625 Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the Notes at the offering price of 98.5 of the aggregate principal amount. The Senior Secured Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior second lien secured basis, by certain subsidiaries of the Company that guarantee the Company s senior committed credit facility and certain of its domestic subsidiaries. 
 58 

Table of Contents 

 The Notes will mature on June 15, 2025. Interest on the Notes accrues at a rate of 8.625 per annum and is payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year. We incurred debt issuance costs of 9.5 million in connection with the issuance of the Notes, which are being amortized over the term of the Notes under the effective interest method. We have had the right, since June 15, 2022, to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture. 
 Committed Credit Facilities 
 As of September 30, 2023, we had five committed bank credit facilities, totaling 1,200.0 million, of which 278.0 million was outstanding. Additional information regarding our bank credit facilities can be found in Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The credit facilities include: 
 A first-lien senior secured syndicated loan facility under which 500.0 million is available to us for general working capital requirements and capital expenditures. The revolving credit facility was amended during the year ended September 30, 2023 to increase the amount available and extend the maturity date to April 21, 2026. The maturity date remains April 21, 2025 for one lender representing 42.5 million of the facility commitment. 
 An unsecured line of credit committed until October 29, 2024, under which 190.0 million is available to our wholly owned subsidiary, StoneX Financial Inc. to provide short term funding of margin to commodity exchanges as necessary. 
 A syndicated borrowing facility committed until July 28, 2024, under which 400.0 million is available to our wholly owned subsidiary, StoneX Commodity Solutions LLC StoneX Commodity Solutions to finance commodity financing arrangements and commodity repurchase agreements. 
 An unsecured syndicated loan facility committed until October 12, 2024, under which our subsidiary, StoneX Financial Ltd is entitled to borrow up to 100.0 million, subject to certain terms and conditions of the credit agreement. This facility is intended to provide short-term funding of margin to commodity exchanges as necessary. 
 An unsecured revolving credit facility committed until September 6, 2024, under which 10.0 million is available to our wholly owned subsidiary, StoneX Financial Pte. Ltd. for general working capital requirements . 
 Our facility agreements contain certain financial covenants relating to financial measures on a consolidated basis, as well as on a stand-alone subsidiary basis, in certain cases, including minimum tangible net worth, minimum regulatory capital, minimum net unencumbered liquid assets, maximum net loss, minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum funded debt to net worth ratio. Failure to comply with any such covenants could result in the debt becoming payable on demand. As of September 30, 2023, we and our subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the outstanding facilities. 
 In accordance with required disclosure as part of our first-lien senior secured syndicated revolving loan facility, during the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2023, interest expense directly attributable to trading activities includes 556.7 million in connection with trading activities conducted as an institutional dealer in fixed income securities, and 39.4 million in connection with securities lending activities. 
 As reflected above, 410.0 million of the Company s committed credit facilities are scheduled to expire during the upcoming year. The Company intends to renew or replace all of its facilities as they expire over time, and based on the Company s liquidity position and capital structure, the Company believes it will be able to do so. 
 Uncommitted Credit Facilities 
 We have access to certain uncommitted financing agreements that support our ordinary course securities and commodities inventories. The agreements are subject to certain borrowing terms and conditions. As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the Company had 55.5 million and 0.0 million total borrowings outstanding under these uncommitted credit facilities, respectively. 
 
 Other Capital Considerations 
 Our activities are subject to various significant governmental regulations and capital adequacy requirements, both in the U.S. and in the international jurisdictions in which we operate. Our subsidiaries are in compliance with all of their capital regulatory requirements as of September 30, 2023. Additional information on our subsidiaries subject to significant net capital and minimum net capital requirements can be found in Note 21 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Our subsidiary, StoneX Markets LLC, is a CFTC registered swap dealer, and under these capital rules is subject to a minimum regulatory capital requirement. StoneX Markets has elected to utilize the bank-based approach, as reflected in CFTC Rule 23.101(a)(1)(i) to calculate its capital requirements. Under the bank-based approach StoneX Markets must satisfy the following capital requirements: Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 capital of at least 20 million; (ii) CET1 equal to at least 
 59 

Table of Contents 

 6.5 of its risk weighted assets RWA (iii) CET1, Additional Tier 1, and Tier 2 (collectively, total aggregate Bank Holding Company BHC capital) equal to at least 8 of its RWA; (iv) total aggregate BHC capital equal to 8 of its uncleared swap margin; and (v) the minimum capital required by NFA. Aggregate BHC capital and the related net capital requirement may fluctuate on a daily basis. 
 Compliance with this or other swap-related regulatory capital requirements may require us to devote more capital to these businesses or otherwise restructure our operations, such as by combining these businesses with other regulated subsidiaries that must also satisfy regulatory capital requirements. StoneX Markets LLC has faced, and may continue to face, increased costs due to the registration and regulatory requirements listed above, as may any other of our subsidiaries that may be required to register, or may register voluntarily, as a swap dealer and/or swap execution facility. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 We include client cash and securities that meet the short term requirement for cash classification to be segregated for regulatory purposes in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We hold a significant amount of U.S. Treasury obligations which represent investment of client funds or client-owned investments pledged in lieu of cash margin. U.S. Treasury securities held with third-party banks or pledged with exchange-clearing organizations representing investments of client funds or which are held for particular clients in lieu of cash margin are included in the beginning and ending cash balances reconciled on our consolidated statements of cash flows to the extent that they have an original or acquired maturity of 90 days or less and, therefore, meet the definition of a segregated cash equivalent. Purchases and sales of U.S. Treasury securities representing investment of clients funds and U.S. Treasury securities pledged or redeemed by particular clients in lieu of cash margin are presented as operating uses and sources of cash, respectively, within the operating section of the consolidated statements of cash flows if they have an original or acquired maturity of greater than 90 days. Typically, there is an offsetting use or source of cash related to the change in the payables to clients. However, we will report a use of cash in periods where segregated U.S. Treasury securities that meet the aforementioned definition of a segregated cash equivalent mature and are replaced with U.S. Treasury securities that have original or acquired maturities that are greater than 90 days. 
 Our cash, segregated cash, cash equivalents, and segregated cash equivalents decreased from 6,285.1 million as of September 30, 2022 to 6,041.7 million as of September 30, 2023, a net decrease of 243.4 million. Net cash of 23.7 million was used in operating activities, including movements typical of our operations, with large changes coming from financial instruments owned, payable to broker dealers, funds with broker dealers and clearing organizations, as well as securities purchased and securities sold. 
 Net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 included significant outflows from payables to lenders under 90 days of 119.3 million, net outflows from payables to lenders greater than 90 days of 35.0 million and payments of deferred acquisitions costs of 18.7 million. Also, we received 3.7 million related to employee stock option exercises. We did not repurchase any of our outstanding common stock during the years ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022. 
 In the broker-dealer and related trading industries, companies report trading activities in the operating section of the statement of cash flows. Due to the daily price volatility in the commodities market, as well as changes in margin requirements, fluctuations in the balances of deposits held at various exchanges, marketable securities and client commodity accounts may occur from day-to-day. A use of cash, as calculated on the consolidated statement of cash flows, includes unrestricted cash transferred and pledged to the exchanges or guaranty funds. These funds are held in interest-bearing deposit accounts at the exchanges, and based on daily exchange requirements, may be withdrawn and returned to unrestricted cash. Additionally, within our unregulated OTC and foreign exchange operations, cash deposits received from clients are reflected as cash provided from operations. Subsequent transfer of these cash deposits to counterparties or exchanges to margin their open positions will be reflected as an operating use of cash to the extent the transfer occurs in a different period than the cash deposit was received. 
 Unrealized gains and losses on open positions revalued at prevailing foreign currency exchange rates are included in trading revenue but have no direct impact on cash flow from operations. Similarly, gains and losses become realized when client transactions are liquidated, though they do not affect cash flow. To some extent, the amount of net deposits made by our clients in any given period is influenced by the impact of gains and losses on our client balances, such that clients may be required to post additional funds to maintain open positions or may choose to withdraw excess funds on open positions. 
 We continuously evaluate opportunities to expand our business. Investing activities include 46.9 million in capital expenditures for property and equipment during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 49.5 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and 62.1 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. Capital expenditures over the past three years have primarily included software development, core information technology hardware acquisitions, and leasehold improvements on office space. 
 Investing activities also include 6.1 million in cash payments for the acquisition of businesses during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 0.2 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and 2.4 million during the 
 60 

Table of Contents 

 fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. Further information about business acquisitions is contained in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These amounts were offset by smaller inflows related to sales of equipment and exchange membership stock, mainly in the year ended September 30, 2021. 
 On August 30, 2023, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock in open market purchases and private transactions, commencing on October 1, 2023 and ending on September 30, 2024. The repurchases are subject to the discretion of the senior management team to implement our stock repurchase plan, and subject to market conditions and as permitted by securities laws and other legal, regulatory and contractual requirements and covenants. 
 Apart from what has been disclosed above, there are no known trends, events or uncertainties that have had or are likely to have a material impact on our liquidity, financial condition and capital resources. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 The following table summarizes our cash payment obligations as of September 30, 2023: 
 Payments Due by Period (in millions) Total Less than 1 year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years After 5 Years Operating lease obligations 183.3 19.9 39.9 37.6 85.9 Purchase obligations (1) 
 5,703.4 5,703.4 Payable to lenders under loans 341.0 159.1 181.9 Senior secured borrowings 347.9 347.9 Contingent acquisition consideration 1.5 1.5 Other 60.8 19.1 23.3 14.0 4.4 6,637.9 5,901.5 593.0 53.1 90.3 
 (1) Represents an estimate of contractual purchase commitments in the ordinary course of business primarily for the purchase of precious metals and agricultural and energy commodities. Unpriced contract commitments have been estimated using September 30, 2023 fair values. The purchase commitments for less than one year will be partially offset by corresponding sales commitments of 5,689.0 million . 
 Total contractual obligations exclude defined benefit pension obligations. We comply with the minimum funding requirements, and accordingly contributed 0.1 million to our defined benefit pension plans during the year ended September 30, 2023. During the year ending September 30, 2024, we anticipate making future benefit payments of 2.1 million related to the defined benefit plans. Additional information on the funded status of these plans can be found in Note 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Based upon our current operations, we believe that cash flow from operations, available cash and available borrowings under our credit facilities will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs. 
 
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We are party to certain financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business as a registered securities broker-dealer, futures commission merchant, U.K. based financial services firm, provisionally registered swap dealer and from our market-making and proprietary trading in the foreign exchange and commodities and debt securities markets. These financial instruments include futures, forward and foreign exchange contracts, exchange-traded and OTC options, To Be Announced TBA securities and interest rate swaps. Derivative financial instruments involve varying degrees of off-balance sheet market risk whereby changes in the fair values of underlying financial instruments may result in changes in the fair value of the financial instruments in excess of the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Exposure to market risk is influenced by a number of factors, including the relationships between the financial instruments and our positions, as well as the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the financial instruments are traded. The principal risk components of financial instruments include, among other things, interest rate volatility, the duration of the underlying instruments and changes in commodity pricing and foreign exchange rates. We attempt to manage our exposure to market risk through various techniques. Aggregate market limits have been established and market risk measures are routinely monitored against these limits. Derivative contracts are traded along with cash transactions because of the integrated nature of the markets for such products. We manage the risks associated with derivatives on an aggregate basis along with the risks associated with our proprietary trading and market-making activities in cash instruments as part of our firm-wide risk management policies. 
 A significant portion of these instruments are primarily the execution of orders for commodity futures and options on futures contracts on behalf of our clients, substantially all of which are transacted on a margin basis. Such transactions may expose us to significant credit risk in the event margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses which clients may incur. We control the risks associated with these transactions by requiring clients to maintain margin deposits in compliance with both 
 61 

Table of Contents 

 clearing organization requirements and internal guidelines. We monitor required margin levels daily and, therefore, may require clients to deposit additional collateral or reduce positions when necessary. We also establish contract limits for clients, which are monitored daily. We evaluate each client s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. Clearing, financing, and settlement activities may require us to maintain funds with or pledge securities as collateral with other financial institutions. Generally, these exposures to exchanges are subject to netting of open positions and collateral, while exposures to clients are subject to netting, per the terms of the client agreements, which reduce the exposure to us by permitting receivables and payables with such clients to be offset in the event of a client default. Management believes that the margin deposits held are adequate to minimize the risk of material loss that could be created by positions held at that time. Additionally, we monitor collateral fair value on a daily basis and adjust collateral levels in the event of excess market exposure. Generally, these exposures to both counterparties and clients are subject to master netting agreements and the terms of the client agreements, which reduce our exposure. 
 As a broker-dealer in U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government agency obligations, agency mortgage-backed obligations, and asset-backed obligations, we are engaged in various securities trading, borrowing and lending activities serving solely institutional counterparties. Our exposure to credit risk associated with the nonperformance of counterparties in fulfilling their contractual obligations pursuant to these securities transactions and market risk associated with the sale of securities not yet purchased can be directly impacted by volatile trading markets which may impair their ability to satisfy outstanding obligations to us. In the event of non-performance and unfavorable market price movements, we may be required to purchase or sell financial instruments, which may result in a loss to us. 
 We transact OTC and foreign exchange contracts with our clients, and our OTC and foreign exchange trade desks will generally offset the client s transaction simultaneously with one of our trading counterparties or will offset that transaction with a similar, but not identical, position on the exchange. These unmatched transactions are intended to be short-term in nature and are conducted to facilitate the most effective transaction for our client. 
 Additionally, we hold options and futures on options contracts resulting from market-making and proprietary trading activities in these product lines. We assist clients in our commodities trading business to protect the value of their future production (precious or base metals) by selling them put options on an OTC basis. We also provide our physical commodities trading business clients with sophisticated option products, including combinations of buying and selling puts and calls. We mitigate our risk by effecting offsetting options with market counterparties or through the purchase or sale of exchange-traded commodities futures. The risk mitigation of offsetting options is not within the documented hedging designation requirements of the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the ASC. 
 As part of the activities discussed above, we carry short positions. We sell financial instruments that we do not own, borrow the financial instruments to make good delivery, and therefore are obliged to purchase such financial instruments at a future date in order to return the borrowed financial instruments. We record these obligations in the consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, at fair value of the related financial instruments, totaling 3,085.6 million and 2,469.6 million, respectively. These positions are held to offset the risks related to financial assets owned, and reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in Financial instruments owned, at fair value , and Physical commodities inventory, net . We will incur losses if the fair value of the Financial instruments sold, not yet purchased , increases subsequent to September 30, 2023, which might be partially or wholly offset by gains in the value of assets held as of September 30, 2023. The totals of 3,085.6 million and 2,469.6 million include a net liability of 288.3 million and 384.0 million for derivatives, based on their fair value as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 We do not anticipate non-performance by counterparties in the above situations. We have a policy of reviewing the credit standing of each counterparty with which we conduct business. We have credit guidelines that limit our current and potential credit exposure to any one counterparty. We administer limits, monitor credit exposure, and periodically review the financial soundness of counterparties. We manage the credit exposure relating to our trading activities in various ways, including entering into collateral arrangements and limiting the duration of exposure. Risk is mitigated in certain cases by closing out transactions and entering into risk reducing transactions. 
 We are a member of various exchanges that trade and clear futures and option contracts. We are also a member of and provide guaranties to securities clearinghouses and exchanges in connection with client trading activities. Associated with our memberships, we may be required to pay a proportionate share of the financial obligations of another member who may default on its obligations to the exchanges. While the rules governing different exchange memberships vary, in general our guaranty obligations would arise only if the exchange had previously exhausted its resources. In addition, any such guaranty obligation would be apportioned among the other non-defaulting members of the exchange. Our liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and could exceed the cash and securities we have posted as collateral at the exchanges. However, management believes that the potential for us to be required to make payments under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly, no contingent liability for these arrangements has been recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023 and 2022.

 Effects of Inflation 
 Increases in our expenses, such as compensation and benefits, transaction-based clearing expenses, occupancy and equipment rental, may result from inflation, which may not be readily recoverable from increasing the prices of our services. While rising interest rates are generally favorable for us, to the extent that inflation has other adverse effects on the financial markets and on the value of the financial instruments held in inventory, it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires that management make estimates and assumptions affecting reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the recorded amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. The accounting policies discussed in this section are those that we consider the most critical to the financial statements. Therefore, understanding these policies is important to understanding our reported and potential future results of operations and financial position. 
 Valuation of Financial Instruments and Foreign Currencies 
 Description 
 Substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the consolidated financial statements at fair value, or amounts that approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or level of collateralization. These financial instruments include: cash and cash equivalents; cash, securities and other assets segregated under federal and other regulations; securities purchased under agreements to resell; securities borrowed; deposits with and receivables from broker-dealers, clearing organizations, and counterparties; financial instruments owned; securities sold under agreements to repurchase; securities loaned; and financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased. Unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments, when we are principal to the transaction, are reflected in earnings. 
 Foreign currency translation is an estimate critical to consolidating in our reporting currency. The value of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, including foreign currencies sold, not yet purchased, are converted into their U.S. dollar equivalents at the foreign exchange rates in effect at the close of business at the end of the accounting period. For foreign currency transactions completed during each reporting period, the relevant exchange rate at the time is used before translation into U.S. dollar equivalent for consolidated reporting. 
 Judgment and Uncertainties 
 At each period end, using professional judgment and industry expertise, we select fair values for financial instruments. Where available, we price from independent sources such as listed market prices, third-party pricing services, or broker dealer price quotations. We use fair values derived from pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments or commodities, as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions. In some cases, even though the value of a security is derived from an independent market price, or broker or dealer quote, we may need to make certain assumptions to determine the fair value. 
 Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions 
 Our valuation assumptions may be incorrect, and the actual value realized upon closing any position could be different from estimated carrying value, because of changes in prices, assumptions, or the overall business environment. We believe that the likelihood that of such an outcome is low and, if it should be the case, it is likely to not be significant. This view is supported by a few key factors: 
 Valuations for substantially all of the financial instruments, most of which are in highly liquid markets, are available from independent, well-known publishers of market information. 
 We have robust controls and procedures surrounding pricing and our various technologies involved in it. 
 The relevant positions are generally short-term in nature. 
 The Company holds positions in a wide range of products, such that an error in a limited number of prices is unlikely to cause a significant change to the overall result and pricing issues in a wide array of products is very unlikely. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Description 
 A significant portion of our revenues are derived principally, from realized and unrealized trading income in securities, derivative instruments, commodities and foreign currencies purchased or sold for our account. We record realized and unrealized trading income on a trade date basis. We state financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold, not yet purchased and foreign currencies sold, not yet purchased, at fair value with related changes in unrealized appreciation or 
 63 

Table of Contents 

 depreciation reflected in Principal gains, net in the Consolidated Income Statements. We record fee and interest income on the accrual basis and dividend income is recognized on the ex-dividend date. 
 
 A substantial amount of our revenues derive from Commission and clearing fees . These revenue types involve less complexity than Principal gains, net would, as, generally, we are an agent in the underlying transactions. We recognize revenues on a trade date basis for the transactions, as, typically, our obligation is met at that point and there are no future obligations to consider. 
 We recognize revenue on commodities that are purchased for physical delivery to clients when we meet our obligations to our clients and in an amount equal to the consideration we expect to receive at that point in time. 
 Judgment and Uncertainties 
 Judgments, outside of the valuation considerations previously discussed, relate to the timing and appropriateness of revenue recognition and whether we have fulfilled our performance obligations. 
 Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions 
 If we misapply the relevant guidance or incorrectly recognize revenue that we have not earned, earnings may be misstated. We do not believe that such a possibility is reasonably likely, because we have developed systems and controls for each of our businesses to capture all known transactions in the appropriate reporting period. In addition, the overwhelming majority of our revenue is recognized upon trade consummation, as we satisfy our performance obligations, and we do not need to estimate when that may have occurred. 
 Income Taxes 
 Description 
 We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. 
 Judgment and Uncertainties 
 Judgment is required in determining the consolidated income taxes and in evaluating tax positions, including evaluating income tax uncertainties. As a result, the company recognizes tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. We do not currently have any uncertain tax positions. 
 Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method, recognizing the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled, with any change in tax rates recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Management considers all relevant evidence for each jurisdiction to determine valuation allowances. If we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets we expect to realize, we adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. 
 Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions 
 We believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgments about future events. To the extent circumstances arise requiring us to change our judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax accounts, we do not believe such a change is likely to be material to our financial statements. The tax accounts in total are relatively immaterial to the balance sheet, which, when combined with their likelihood of being misstated, particularly our valuation allowances given our positive earnings trend in recent years, results in a generally insignificant risk to us. 
 
 Accounting Standards Update 
 In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers ASU 2021-08 ). ASU 2021-08 requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities from acquired contracts using the revenue recognition guidance under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contacts with Customers, in order to recognize contract liabilities in alignment with the definition of performance obligations. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning October 1, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. We do not believe that adoption of ASU 2021-08 will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. We do not expect any other recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant effect on our financial statements.

 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 See also Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk and Concentrations of Credit Risk . 
 Market Risk 
 We conduct our market-making and trading activities predominantly as a principal, which subjects our capital to significant risks. These risks include, but are not limited to, absolute and relative price movements, price volatility and changes in liquidity, over which we have virtually no control. Our exposure to market risk varies in accordance with the volume of client-driven market-making transactions, the size of the proprietary positions and the volatility of the financial instruments traded. 
 We seek to mitigate exposure to market risk by utilizing a variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques: 
 Diversification of business activities and instruments; 
 Limitations on positions; 
 Allocation of capital and limits based on estimated weighted risks; and 
 Daily monitoring of positions and mark-to-market profitability. 
 We utilize derivative products in a trading capacity as a dealer to satisfy client needs and mitigate risk. We manage risks from both derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments on a consolidated basis. The risks of derivatives should not be viewed in isolation, but in aggregate with our other trading activities. 
 We are exposed to market risk in connection with our retail trading activities. Because we act as counterparty to our retail clients transactions, we are exposed to risk on each trade that the value of our position will decline. Accordingly, accurate and efficient management of our net exposure is a high priority, and we have developed policies addressing both our automated and manual procedures to manage our exposure. These risk-management policies and procedures are established and reviewed regularly by the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. Our risk-management policies require quantitative analyses by instrument, as well as assessment of a range of market inputs, including trade size, dealing rate, client margin and market liquidity. Our risk-management procedures require our team of senior traders to monitor risk exposure on a continuous basis and update senior management both informally over the course of the trading day and formally through intraday and end of day reporting. A key component of our approach to managing market risk is that we do not initiate market positions for our own account in anticipation of future movements in the relative prices of products we offer.

 Management believes that the volatility of revenues is a key indicator of the effectiveness of its risk management techniques. The graph below summarizes volatility of our daily revenue, determined on a marked-to-market basis, during the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 In our Securities market-making and trading activities, we maintain inventories of equity and debt securities. In our Commercial segment, our positions include physical commodities inventories, precious metals on lease, forwards, futures and options on futures, and OTC derivatives. Our commodity trading activities are managed as one consolidated book for each commodity encompassing both cash positions and derivative instruments. We monitor the aggregate position for each commodity in equivalent physical ounces, metric tons, or other relevant unit. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 In the ordinary course of our operations, we have interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect the values of financial instruments and impact interest income earned. Within our domestic institutional dealer in fixed income securities business, we maintain a significant amount of trading assets and liabilities which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. These trading activities primarily consist of securities trading in connection with U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agency, agency mortgage-backed and agency asset-backed obligations as well as investment grade, high-yield, convertible and emerging markets debt securities. Derivative instruments, which consist of futures, TBA securities and forward settling transactions, are used to manage risk exposures in the trading inventory. We enter into TBA securities transactions for the sole purpose of managing risk associated with mortgage-backed securities. 
 In addition, we generate interest income from the positive spread earned on client deposits. We typically invest in U.S. Treasury bills, notes, and obligations issued by government sponsored entities, reverse repurchase agreements involving U.S. Treasury bills and government obligations or AA-rated money market funds. In some instances, we maintain interest earning cash deposits with banks, clearing organizations and counterparties. We have an investment policy which establishes acceptable standards of credit quality and limits the amount of funds that can be invested within a particular fund, institution, clearing organization or counterparty. We estimate that as of September 30, 2023, an immediate 25 basis point decrease in short-term interest rates would result in approximately 4.2 million less in annual net income. 
 66 

Table of Contents 

 We manage interest expense using a combination of variable and fixed rate debt. The debt instruments are carried at their unpaid principal balance which approximates fair value. As of September 30, 2023, 341.0 million of outstanding principal debt was variable-rate debt. We are subject to earnings and liquidity risks for changes in the interest rate on this debt. As of September 30, 2023, 347.9 million of outstanding principal debt was fixed-rate long-term debt. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 Currency risk arises from the possibility that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will impact the value of our earnings and assets. Entities that have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the primary economic environment in which the entity operates are subject to remeasurement. Principally, all sales are denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary, while related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into USD for consolidated reporting purposes. Although the majority of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary, they may also hold assets or liabilities denominated in other currencies. As a result, our results of operations and financial position are exposed to changing currency rates. We have executed hedging transactions in relation to certain currencies to mitigate our exposure to volatility in those certain foreign currency exchange rates. From time-to-time, we may consider entering into larger hedges in those certain contracts or hedging transactions in additional currencies to mitigate our exposure to more foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging transactions may not be successful.

 ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 
 
 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 StoneX Group Inc.: 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of StoneX Group Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated income statements, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated statements of cash flows, and consolidated statements of stockholders equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated November 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Revenue recognition for unrealized gains and losses from market making activities 
 As discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized revenue of 1,079.9 million for principal gains, net from transactions or contracts for the which the Company acted as principal, a portion of which related to unrealized gains and losses derived from over-the-counter derivatives and foreign exchange market making activities (collectively, Unrealized Gains and Losses). Such Unrealized Gains and Losses represent the change in fair value for those financial instruments owned and sold, not yet purchased that are held by the Company as of year-end and reflected in earnings. 
 We identified revenue recognition related to certain Unrealized Gains and Losses as a critical audit matter. A high degree of auditor subjectivity and judgement was involved in determining the sufficiency and timing of audit procedures required to evaluate the existence and accuracy of certain Unrealized Gains and Losses reflected in earnings as of September 30, 2023. 
 68 

Table of Contents 

 The following are primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to Unrealized Gains and Losses, including controls over the computations of Unrealized Gains and Losses, as well as controls ensuring that trading subledger values were not modified within these computations. We evaluated Unrealized Gains and Losses as of September 30, 2023 by assessing the Company s revenue recognition, comparing inputs to Unrealized Gains and Losses computations prepared by the Company to source documents and recalculating Unrealized Gains and Losses recorded. We also assessed the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained related to Unrealized Gains and Losses by evaluating the cumulative results of the audit procedures and potential management bias.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 StoneX Group Inc.: 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited StoneX Group Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated income statements, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated statements of cash flows and consolidated statements of stockholders equity, for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated November 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
 The Company acquired CDI Soci t Cotonniere De Distribution S.A. and subsidiaries and Incomm S.A.S. during 2023, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, CDI Soci t Cotonniere De Distribution S.A. and subsidiaries and Incomm S.A.S. s internal control over financial reporting associated with aggregate total assets of 151.2 million and aggregate total revenues of 388.6 million included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of CDI Soci t Cotonniere De Distribution S.A. and subsidiaries and Incomm S.A.S. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 of the consolidated operating revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. The operating environment in Argentina continues to present business challenges, including ongoing devaluation of the Argentine peso and significant inflation. Based upon inflationary data published by the International Practices Task Force of the Center for Audit Quality, the economy of Argentina became highly inflationary during the three months ended June 30, 2018, and continues to be considered highly inflationary. 
 As a result of Argentina s highly inflationary status, the Company recorded translation gains through earnings of million and million for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company recorded de minimis translation adjustments through earnings for the year ended September 30, 2021.

 Deposits with and receivables from broker-dealers, clearing organizations, and counterparties also includes guaranty deposits with clearing exchanges. The guaranty deposits are held by the clearing exchanges for use in potential default situations by one or more members of the clearing exchanges. The guaranty deposits may be applied to the Company s obligations to the clearing exchange, or to the clearing exchange s obligations to unrelated parties. 
 Deposits with and receivables from broker-dealers, clearing organizations, and counterparties also include securities pledged to clearing exchanges. These securities are either pledged to the Company by its clients or represent investments of client funds. It is the Company s practice to include client-owned securities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, as the rights to those securities have been transferred to the Company under the terms of the relevant futures trading agreements. Securities pledged primarily include U.S. Treasury obligations, foreign government obligations, and certain ETFs. Securities that are not client-owned, and represent an investment of client funds, are adjusted to fair value with associated changes in unrealized gains or losses recorded in Interest income in the Consolidated Income Statements. For client-owned securities, the change in fair value is offset against the payable to clients with no impact recognized in the Consolidated Income Statements. The total fair value of such client owned and non-client owned securities included within Deposits with and receivables from broker-dealers, clearing organizations, and counterparties, net was million and million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 Management has considered guidance required by ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing as it relates to securities pledged by clients to margin their futures and options on futures trading accounts. Management believes that the transferor surrenders control over those assets because: (a) the transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor put presumptively beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership, (b) each transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets (or beneficial interests) it received, and no condition both constrains the transferee (or holder) from taking advantage of its right to pledge or exchange and provides more than a trivial benefit to the transferor and (c) the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through either (1) an agreement that both entitles and obligates the transferor to repurchase or redeem them before their maturity or (2) the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets, other than through a cleanup call. Under this guidance, the Company reflects the client collateral assets and corresponding liabilities in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023 and 2022. 
 Deposits with and receivables from broker-dealers, clearing organizations, and counterparties also includes amounts due from clearing exchanges for unrealized gains and losses associated with clients options on futures contracts. See discussion in the Financial Instruments section below for additional information on the Company s accounting policies for derivative contracts. For client-owned derivative contracts, the fair value is offset against the payable to clients with no impact recognized on the Consolidated Income Statements.

 Additional Disclosures about the Fair Value of Financial Instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at Fair Value 
 Many, but not all, of the financial instruments that the Company holds are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following represents financial instruments in which the ending balances at September 30, 2023 and 2022 were not carried at fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP on our Consolidated Balance Sheets: 
 Short-term financial instruments: The carrying values of short-term financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, cash segregated under federal and other regulations, securities purchased under agreements to re-sell and securities sold under agreements to re-purchase, and securities borrowed and loaned are recorded at amounts that approximate the fair value of these instruments due to their short-term nature and level of collateralization. These financial instruments generally expose the Company to limited credit risk and have no stated maturities or have short-term maturities and carry interest rates that approximate market rates. Under the fair value hierarchy, cash and cash equivalents and cash segregated under federal and other regulations are classified as Level 1. Securities purchased under agreements to re-sell and securities sold under agreements to re-purchase, and securities borrowed and loaned are classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy as they are generally overnight, or short-term in nature, and are collateralized by common stock, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government agency obligations, agency mortgage-backed obligations, and asset-backed obligations. 
 Receivables and other assets: Deposits with and receivables from broker-dealers, clearing organizations, and counterparties, receivable from clients, net, notes receivables, net and certain other assets are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value due to their short-term nature and are classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. 
 Payables: Payables to clients and payables to brokers-dealers, clearing organizations, and counterparties are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. They are classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy.

 The Company utilizes derivative products in its trading capacity as a dealer in order to satisfy client needs and mitigate risk. The Company manages risks from both derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments on a consolidated basis. The risks of derivatives should not be viewed in isolation, but in aggregate with the Company s other trading activities.

 year from the end of the current period. 
 
 The Company also uses foreign currency derivatives, in the form of forward contracts, to hedge risk related to the variability in exchange rates relative to certain of the Company s non-USD expenditures. These hedges are designated cash flow hedges, through which the Company mitigates variability in exchange rates by exchanging foreign currency for USD at fixed exchange rates at a pre-determined future date, or several cash flows at several pre-determined future dates. While the forward contracts mitigate exchange rate variability risk, they do introduce credit risk, which is the possibility that the Company s trading counterparty fails to meet its obligation. The Company minimizes this risk by entering into its forward contracts with highly-rated, multi-national institutions. These hedges will all mature within years from the end of the current period. 
 
 The Company assesses the effectiveness of its hedges at each reporting period to identify any required reclassifications into current earnings. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not designate any portion of its hedges as ineffective and thus did not have any values in current earnings related to ineffective hedges.

 Credit Risk 
 In the normal course of business, the Company purchases and sells financial instruments, commodities and foreign currencies as either principal or agent on behalf of its clients. If either the client or counterparty fails to perform, the Company may be required to discharge the obligations of the nonperforming party. In such circumstances, the Company may sustain a loss if the fair value of the financial instrument or foreign currency is different from the contract value of the transaction. 
 The majority of the Company s transactions and, consequently, the concentration of its credit exposure are with commodity exchanges, clients, broker-dealers and other financial institutions. These activities involve both collateralized and uncollateralized arrangements and may result in credit exposure in the event that a counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Company s exposure to credit risk can be directly impacted by volatile financial markets, which may impair the ability of counterparties to satisfy their contractual obligations. The Company seeks to control its credit risk through a variety of reporting and control procedures, including establishing credit limits based upon a review of counterparties financial condition and credit ratings. The Company monitors collateral levels on a daily basis for compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines. The Company requests changes in collateral levels as appropriate. 
 The Company is a party to financial instruments in the normal course of its business through client and proprietary trading accounts in exchange-traded and OTC derivative instruments. These instruments are primarily the execution of orders for commodity futures, options on futures and forward foreign currency contracts on behalf of its clients, substantially all of these transactions occur on a margin basis. Such transactions may expose the Company to significant credit risk in the event margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses which clients may incur. The Company controls the risks associated with these transactions by requiring clients to maintain margin deposits in compliance with individual exchange regulations and internal guidelines. The Company monitors required margin levels daily and, therefore, may require clients to deposit additional collateral or reduce positions when necessary. The Company also establishes client credit limits, which are monitored daily. The Company evaluates each client s creditworthiness on a case by case basis. Clearing, financing, and settlement activities may require the Company to maintain funds with or pledge securities as collateral with other financial institutions. Generally,

 or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from three to , and some of which include the Company s option to terminate the leases within of the balance sheet date. In determining the term of certain office space leases, the Company has not considered any renewal options in the lease terms of its office space leases as the Company does not believe it is reasonably certain that any of the rights will be exercised. Further, the Company has not included periods after termination date, if the Company holds a termination option and believes it is reasonably certain to exercise. 
 As the office space leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company applies a collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on information available at lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. For office space leases executed by subsidiaries, including foreign subsidiaries, the Company has applied its incremental borrowing rate. The Company believes this is a reasonable approach as its subsidiaries either do not have their own treasury functions or the credit facilities available to its subsidiaries do not permit financing of right-of-use assets. Additionally, in certain instances, the parent company provides a guaranty of the lease payments to the lessor under office space leases executed by its subsidiaries. The Company believes that pricing subsidiary leases is more significantly influenced by the credit standing of the parent company than that of its subsidiaries. 
 Certain office space leases contain variable lease payments related to fair market rent adjustments and local inflation index measures. The Company estimates variable lease payments based upon information available at lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.

 A CTA is registered with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC and a member of, and subject to audit by, the National Futures Association NFA ). OptionSellers was registered under a CFTC Rule 4.7 exemption for providing services only to qualified eligible persons, which requires the account holders authorizing OptionSellers to act as their CTA to meet or exceed certain minimum financial requirements. OptionSellers, in its role as a CTA, had been granted by each of its clients full discretionary authority to manage the trading in the clients accounts, while StoneX Financial Inc. acted solely as the clearing firm in its role as the FCM. 
 StoneX Financial Inc. s client agreements hold account holders liable for all losses in their accounts and obligate the account holders to reimburse StoneX Financial Inc. for any deficits in their accounts. As of September 30, 2023, the receivable from these client accounts, net of collections and other allowable deductions (the Net Client Accounts Receivable ), was million, with no individual account receivable exceeding million. As of September 30, 2023, the allowance against these uncollected balances was million. The Company is pursuing collection of the uncollected balances through arbitration proceedings against the account holders. The Company will consider developments in these proceedings, and any other relevant matters, in determining whether any changes in the allowance against the uncollected balances are required. 
 In these and other arbitration proceedings, clients are seeking damages from StoneX Financial Inc. relating to the trading losses in their accounts. 
 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Company resolved several of these arbitration claims through arbitration decisions and privately negotiated settlements. All of the arbitration panels that issued decisions during the year awarded StoneX Financial Inc. the full amount of the uncollected balances. A portion of the panels also awarded relief to account holders. The amount of relief awarded was not material to the Company, individually or in the aggregate. As noted, several of the arbitrations were resolved through privately negotiated settlement, pursuant to which the account holders agreed to pay some or all of their outstanding deficit balances. In October 2022, the Company reached an additional privately negotiated settlement of an arbitration proceeding, pursuant to which the account holders agreed to pay all of their outstanding deficit balances and the Company made certain immaterial payments to the account holders. The Company intends to continue vigorously pursuing claims through arbitration and settling cases in what the Company determines to be appropriate circumstances. The ultimate outcome of remaining arbitrations cannot presently be determined. 
 Depending on future collections and the outcomes of arbitration proceedings, any provisions for bad debts and actual losses may or may not be material to the Company s financial results. However, the Company believes that the likelihood of a material adverse outcome is remote, and does not currently believe that any potential losses related to this matter would impact its ability to comply with its ongoing liquidity, capital, and regulatory requirements.

 Sweep Program Fees 
 The Company earns fees generated in lieu of interest income from a multi-bank sweep program with unaffiliated banks and money market funds. Pursuant to contractual arrangements with clients and their introducing-brokers, available cash balances in client accounts are swept into either Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insured cash accounts at unaffiliated banks or unaffiliated money market funds for which the Company earns a portion of the income generated by the client balances for administration and recordkeeping. The fees generated by the Company s multi-bank sweep program are reported net of the balances remitted to the introducing-brokers and the clients of introducing-brokers. These fees are paid and recognized over time to match the continued delivery of the administration and recordkeeping performance obligations to the life of the contract. The fees earned under this program are generally based upon the type of sweep account, prevailing interest rates, and the amount of client balances invested. 
 Client Account Fees 
 Client account fees represent fees earned for custodial, recordkeeping, and administrative functions performed for client accounts.

 Precious Metals Sales Under ASC Topic 606 
 The Company principally generates revenue from sale of bullion coins and small bars of precious metal via its websites. Revenues from the sale of physical precious metals are recognized when control of the inventory is transferred within the meaning of Topic 606. This revenue source primarily executes its contracts on a spot basis at agreed upon rates and amounts, which further aligns with Topic 606. 
 Physical Precious Metals Under ASC 815 
 The Company principally generates revenue from trading physical precious metals on an OTC basis.

The contracts underlying the Company s commitment to deliver precious metals are referred to as fixed price forward commodity contracts because the price of the commodity is fixed at the time the order is placed. Although the contracts typically are executed on a spot basis and settle on unallocated account, the client has the option to request delivery of the precious metals, the option to net settle out of the position by executing an offsetting trade, or the option to roll the transaction to a subsequent maturity date. Thus, the sales contracts contain embedded option derivatives that would be subject to the guidance in Topic 815. As the contracts are subject to the guidance in Topic 815, the fixed price derivative sales contracts are outside the scope of Topic 606. The Company recognizes revenue when control of the inventory is transferred within the meaning of Topic 606.

 Interest Income 
 Interest income is generated from client funds deposited with the Company to satisfy margin required by third-party banks, exchange-clearing organizations, or other FCMs. Interest income is also generated from investing client funds in allowable securities, primarily U.S. Treasury obligations and from trading fixed income securities that the Company holds in its market-making businesses. Interest income also includes interest generated from collateralized transactions, including securities borrowed and securities purchased under agreements to resell, and from extending margin loans to clients. Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis and is not within the scope of Topic 606. 
 Remaining Performance Obligations 
 Remaining performance obligations are services that the firm has committed to perform in the future in connection with its contracts with clients. The Company s remaining performance obligations are generally related to its risk management consulting and asset management contracts with clients.

Similar to the above, risk management consulting contracts are generally for a minimum term of and then continue from month to month, but may be terminated at any time after the original by either party upon providing written notice. Asset management contracts may be terminated by the client at any time. For the Company s asset management activities, where fees are calculated based on a percentage of the market value of eligible assets in client s accounts, future revenue associated with remaining performance obligations cannot be determined as such fees are subject to fluctuations in the market value of eligible assets in clients accounts.

 The total revenues reported combine gross revenues from physical contracts for subsidiaries that are not broker-dealers and net revenues for all other businesses. In order to reflect the way that the Company s management views the results, the table below also reflects the segment contribution to Operating revenues , which is shown on the face of the Consolidated Income Statements and which is calculated by deducting physical commodities cost of sales from total revenues. 
 Segment data includes the profitability measure of net contribution by segment. Net contribution is one of the key measures used by management to assess the performance of each segment and for decisions regarding the allocation of the Company s resources. Net contribution is calculated as revenue less direct cost of sales, transaction-based clearing expenses, variable compensation, introducing broker commissions, and interest expense. Variable compensation paid to risk management consultants/traders generally represents a fixed percentage of revenues generated, and in some cases, revenues generated less transaction-based clearing expenses, base salaries and an overhead allocation. 
 Segment data also includes segment income which is calculated as net contribution less non-variable direct expenses of the segment. These non-variable direct expenses include trader base compensation and benefits, operational employee compensation and benefits, communication and data services, business development, professional fees, bad debt expense and other direct expenses. 
 Inter-segment revenues, expenses, receivables and payables are eliminated upon consolidation. 
 Total revenues, operating revenues and net operating revenues shown as Corporate Unallocated primarily consist of interest income from its centralized corporate treasury function. In the normal course of operations, the Company operates a centralized corporate treasury function in which it may sweep excess cash from certain subsidiaries, where permitted within regulatory limitations, in exchange for a short-term interest bearing intercompany payable, or provide excess cash to subsidiaries in exchange for a short-term interest bearing intercompany receivable in lieu of the subsidiary borrowing on external credit facilities. The intercompany receivables and payables are eliminated during consolidation; however, this practice may impact reported total assets between segments. 
 Net costs not allocated to operating segments include costs and expenses of certain shared services such as information technology, accounting and treasury, credit and risk, legal and compliance, and human resources and other activities.

 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In connection with the filing of this Form 10-K, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2023. We seek to design our disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act contain the required information and that we submit these reports within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. We also seek to design these controls and procedures to ensure that we accumulate and communicate correct information to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2023. 
 (b) Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles U.S. GAAP ). Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 There are limitations inherent in any internal control, such as the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and may not prevent or detect misstatements. As conditions change over time, so too may the effectiveness of internal controls. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. 
 Management s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023 excluded CDI-Societe Cotonniere De Distribution S.A. and subsidiaries, acquired with effect from October 31, 2022, and Incomm S.A.S., acquired with effect from February 3, 2023. These acquired businesses had aggregate total assets of 151.2 million and total revenues of 388.6 million included in the Company s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 Based on its assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023. 
 KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, was engaged to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023 and has issued an audit report regarding their assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting which is included on page 69 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 (c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 During the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company completed its migration of a significant component of subsidiaries to a different accounting system. Management implemented data migration, onboarding, and post go-live controls over the new system. The rigor around the migrations allows management to conclude that this does not present an issue with internal control over financial reporting.
