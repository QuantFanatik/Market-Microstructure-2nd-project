Table of Contents 
 tablet computers, notebooks, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence applications to help our customers meet their current challenges and future innovations. Appliances (39 of segment s net sales) We provide solutions to meet the daily demands of home appliances. Our products are used in many household appliances, including washers, dryers, refrigerators, air conditioners, dishwashers, cooking appliances, water heaters, air purifiers, floor care devices, and microwaves. Our expansive range of standard products is supplemented by an array of custom-designed solutions. The Communications Solutions segment s major competitors include Amphenol, Molex, JST, and Korea Electric Terminal (KET). Customers As an industry leader, we have established close working relationships with many of our customers. These relationships allow us to better anticipate and respond to customer needs when designing new products and new technical solutions. By working with our customers in developing new products and technologies, we believe we can identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about next-generation technology across our products. Our approach to our customers is driven by our dedication to further develop our product families and ensure that we are globally positioned to best provide our customers with sales and engineering support. We believe that as electronic component technologies continue to proliferate, our broad product portfolio and engineering capability give us a potential competitive advantage when addressing the needs of our global customers. We manufacture and sell a broad portfolio of products to customers in various industries. Our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries, and our relationships with them typically date back many years. We believe that our diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduce our exposure to individual end markets, thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance. Additionally, we believe that the diversity of our customer base reduces the level of cyclicality in our results and distinguishes us from our competitors. No single customer accounted for a significant amount of our net sales in fiscal 2023, 2022, or 2021. Sales and Distribution We maintain a strong local presence in each of the geographic regions in which we operate. Our net sales by geographic region (1) as a percentage of our total net sales were as follows: 

Fiscal 2023 2022 2021 Europe/Middle East/Africa EMEA 39 35 37 Asia Pacific 32 35 36 Americas 29 30 27 Total 100 100 100 

 (1) Net sales to external customers are attributed to individual countries based on the legal entity that records the sale. We sell our products into approximately 140 countries primarily through direct selling efforts to manufacturers. In fiscal 2023, our direct sales represented approximately 80 of total net sales. We also sell our products indirectly via third-party distributors. We maintain distribution centers around the world. Products are generally delivered to the distribution centers by our manufacturing facilities and then subsequently delivered to the customer. In some instances, however, products are delivered directly from our manufacturing facility to the customer. Our global coverage positions us near our customers locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering their production costs. We contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products globally via road, rail, sea, and air. We believe our balanced sales distribution lowers our exposure to any particular geography and improves our financial profile.

 Seasonality and Backlog Typically, we experience a slight seasonal pattern to our business. Overall, the third and fourth fiscal quarters are usually the strongest quarters of our fiscal year, whereas the first fiscal quarter is negatively affected by holidays and the second fiscal quarter may be affected by adverse winter weather conditions in some of our markets. Certain of our end markets experience some seasonality. Our sales in the automotive market are dependent upon global automotive production, and seasonal declines in European production may negatively impact net sales in the fourth fiscal quarter. Also, our sales in the energy market typically increase in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as customer activity increases. Customer orders and demand may fluctuate as a result of economic and market conditions, including supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressures. Backlog by reportable segment was as follows: 

Fiscal Year End 2023 2022 (in millions) Transportation Solutions 2,981 3,179 Industrial Solutions 2,448 2,432 Communications Solutions 617 885 Total 6,046 6,496 We expect that the majority of our backlog at fiscal year end 2023 will be filled during fiscal 2024. Backlog is not necessarily indicative of future net sales as unfilled orders may be cancelled prior to shipment of goods. Competition The industries in which we operate are highly competitive, and we compete with thousands of companies that range from large multinational corporations to local manufacturers. Competition is generally based on breadth of product offering, product innovation, price, quality, delivery, and service. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, downward pressure on prices. However, as a result of increased costs, certain of our businesses implemented price increases in fiscal 2023 and 2022. Raw Materials We use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products. The principal raw materials that we use include plastic resins for molding; precious metals such as gold, silver, and palladium for plating; and other metals such as copper, aluminum, brass, and steel for manufacturing cable, contacts, and other parts that are used for cable and component bodies and inserts. Many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers. The prices of these materials are driven by global supply and demand. In recent years, raw material prices and availability have been affected by worldwide economic conditions, including supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressures. Intellectual Property Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities, and monitor the intellectual property claims of others. We own a large portfolio of patents that relate principally to electrical, optical, and electronic products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks.

 While we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by any single patent or group of related patents. Human Capital Management We have employees located throughout the world. As of fiscal year end 2023, we employed approximately 90,000 people worldwide, including contract employees. Approximately 38,000 were in the EMEA region, 25,000 were in the Asia Pacific region, and 27,000 were in the Americas region. Of our total employees, approximately 54,000 were employed in manufacturing. Our strong employee base, along with their commitment to uncompromising values, provides the foundation of our company s success. Our core values integrity, accountability, inclusion, teamwork, and innovation govern us. They guide our decisions and our actions, both individually and as an organization. Additionally, our employees are responsible for upholding our purpose to create a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future. We track and report internally on key talent metrics including workforce demographics, critical role pipeline data, diversity data, and engagement and inclusion indices. We aspire to have 30 of leadership roles filled by women by fiscal 2026 and are committed to increasing the total number of women across all levels of the organization. As part of its charter, the management development and compensation committee of our board of directors oversees our policies and practices related to the management of human capital resources including talent management, culture, diversity, and inclusion. We embrace diversity and inclusion. A truly innovative workforce needs to be diverse and leverage the skills and perspectives of a wealth of backgrounds and experiences. We are committed to a work environment where all employees are engaged, feel differences are valued and mutually-respected, and believe that all opinions count. To drive our business outcomes globally, we believe we must build a workforce and supplier network that represents our global markets and the customers we serve. As such, our people reflect our customers and markets. Our employees are in over 50 countries representing approximately 135 nationalities, and our total employee population is over 40 women. Our employee resource groups ERGs are company-sponsored, voluntary, employee-led groups that focus on diverse talent segments or shared experiences of employees. These groups apply those perspectives to create value for our company as a whole. The ERGs provide a space where employees can foster connections and develop in a supportive environment. As of fiscal year end 2023, we had eight ERGs ALIGN (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer employees (LGBTQ+) and their allies), Women in Networking, TE Young Professionals, African Heritage, Asian Heritage, Latin Heritage, THRIVE (employees with mental, emotional, and physical disabilities and their allies), and TE Veterans. Our ERGs have a total of approximately 9,500 members. During fiscal 2023, we conducted our fourth annual employee engagement survey, which was a fully digital, enterprise-wide survey available in 20 languages and focused on measuring engagement, inclusion, and leadership effectiveness. We had a participation rate of over 85 in fiscal 2023. Our inclusion and leadership effectiveness scores were consistent with fiscal 2022 results; however, our engagement score decreased slightly. Our engagement and inclusion scores were once again favorable when compared to Glint Inc. s external global manufacturing benchmark . By fiscal 2025, we aspire to be in the top tier of this benchmark on engagement and inclusion. We continue to emphasize employee development and training to support engagement and retention. To empower employees to unleash their potential, we provide a range of development programs and opportunities, skills, and resources they need to be successful. Our LEARN@TE platform supplements our talent development strategies. It is an online portal that enables employees to access instructor-led classroom or virtual courses and self-directed web-based courses. Strategy, execution, and talent SET leadership expectations, which focus on how we drive strategy, effectively execute, and build talent, have been rolled out to all employees and are embedded in all of our leadership programs. We integrate these behavioral expectations into the way we assess and select talent, manage performance, and develop and reward our people. We are committed to identifying and developing our next generation of leaders. We have a robust talent and succession planning process and have established specialized programs to support the development of our talent pipeline for critical roles in general management, engineering, and operations, as well as the diversity of our talent. We are focused on both the recruitment of diverse candidates and the development of our diverse employees to provide the opportunity to advance their careers and move into leadership positions within the company. On an annual basis, we conduct an organization and leadership review process with our chief executive officer and all segment, business unit, and function leaders focusing on our high-performing and high-potential talent, diverse talent, and the succession for our most critical roles. Also, our board of directors reviews and assesses management development plans for senior executives and the succession plans relating to those positions.

 We are committed to the safety, health, well-being, and human rights of our employees. We continuously evaluate opportunities to raise safety and health standards through our environmental, health, and safety team. Compliance audits and internal processes are in place to stay ahead of workplace hazards, and we aim to reduce our Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA total recordable incident rate a rate equivalent to the number of incidents per 100 employees or 200,000 work hours to 0.12 by fiscal 2025. We remain focused on the protection of global human rights and have instituted several policies to guide us including our global human rights policy and our human trafficking and modern slavery policy. During fiscal 2023, we undertook a human rights risk assessment to identify areas of strength and risk for our operations and value chain, and we have developed a roadmap to strengthen our human rights approach. We apply high standards of human rights and require that our suppliers do the same. We believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology leadership. Our chief executive officer and segment leaders average over 25 years of industry experience. They are supported by an experienced and talented management team who is dedicated to maintaining and expanding our position as a global leader in the industry. For discussion of the risks relating to the attraction and retention of management and executive management employees, see Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors. Government Regulation and Supervision The import and export of products are subject to regulation by the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. A small portion of our products, including defense-related products, may require governmental import and export licenses, whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events. We have a trade compliance organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations. Any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding trade compliance matters. Also, see Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors for discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with trade regulations. Environmental Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, greenhouse gas GHG emissions, hazardous materials in products, and chemical usage. We are committed to complying with these laws and to the protection of our employees and the environment. We maintain a global environmental, health, and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards; staff dedicated to environmental, health, and safety issues; periodic compliance auditing; training; and other measures. We also have a program for compliance with the European Union EU Restriction of Hazardous Substances RoHS and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment WEEE Directives; the China Administrative Measures for the Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Products China RoHS regulation; the EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals REACH regulation; and similar laws. Compliance with these laws has increased our costs of doing business in a variety of ways and may continue to do so in the future. For example, laws regarding product content and chemical registration require extensive and costly data collection, management, and reporting, and laws regulating GHG emissions may increase our costs for energy and certain materials and products. We also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing sites to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. Based upon our experience, available information, and applicable laws, as of fiscal year end 2023, we concluded that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the reasonably possible range of 17 million to 45 million, and we accrued 20 million as the probable loss, which was the best estimate within this range. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2024 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to GHG emissions. Sustainability We look to build on our strong foundation of environmental sustainability in our operations. Our One Connected World strategy guides how we balance investor and customer expectations and drive improved environmental sustainability. Our sustainability initiatives began several years ago and have continued to evolve. From fiscal 2020 to 2023, we achieved more than a 20 reduction in energy use intensity, more than a 15 reduction in total water withdrawal, and more than a 60 reduction in absolute GHG emissions for Scopes 1 and 2. We have challenged ourselves to find new ways to 
 6 

Table of Contents 
 continue to drive sustainability improvements. We have also committed to near-term, company-wide emissions reductions in line with climate science and Science Based Targets initiative SBTi objectives. We have established a number of mid-term goals and long-term ambitions including the following: 

Targeted Fiscal Year Baseline Fiscal Year of Achievement 70 + reduction in absolute GHG emissions for Scopes 1 and 2 2020 2030 15 reduction in water withdrawals at target sites with extremely high and high water stress 2021 2025 15 reduction in hazardous waste disposed 2021 2025 80 renewable electricity use in our operations n/a 2025 While sustainability is embedded in our operations, we are exploring opportunities with our direct suppliers and logistics service providers to strengthen the environmental sustainability of our supply chain. The majority of our GHG emissions are from the goods and services we use in our operations. In addition to improving the sustainability of our operations and working with our suppliers to reduce their GHG emissions, we help our customers produce smaller, lighter, and more energy-efficient products, reducing the environmental impact of the products our customers make through the life of their products. We support a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future through the products that come out of our facilities.

RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our securities. These risks are not the only ones facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks that affect many other companies. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations, financial condition, and liquidity . Risks Relating to the Macroeconomic Environment and Our Global Presence Conditions in global or regional economies, capital and money markets, and banking systems, and cyclical industry demand may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by economic conditions regionally or globally, including new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, including escalation of trade tensions between the United States U.S. ), China, the EU, and other countries, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, inflation, slower growth or recession, higher interest rates, labor disruptions, the cost and availability of consumer and business credit, end demand from consumer and industrial markets, significant bank failures, government shutdowns, and concerns as to sovereign debt levels including credit rating downgrades and defaults on sovereign debt. Any of these economic factors could cause our customers to experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow, financial condition, and ability to obtain financing. As a result, existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion or in full. Further, our vendors may experience similar problems, which may impact their ability to fulfill our orders or meet agreed service and quality levels. If regional or global economic conditions deteriorate, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Also, deterioration in

 economic conditions, expectations for future revenue, projected future cash flows, or other factors have triggered and could trigger additional recognition of impairment charges for our goodwill or other long-lived assets. Impairment charges, if any, may be material to our results of operations and financial position. Foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in U.S. dollars; however, a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the U.S. Changes in the relative values of currencies may have a significant effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We are exposed to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our costs and revenue. Approximately 60 of our net sales for fiscal 2023 were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and we expect non-U.S. dollar revenue to continue to represent a significant portion of our future net sales. We have elected not to hedge this foreign currency exposure. Therefore, when the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the countries where we sell our products, such as the euro or Asian currencies, our U.S. dollar reported revenue and income will decrease. In recent years, the strength of the U.S. dollar has generally increased as compared to other currencies, which has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our operating results as reported in U.S. dollars. We manage certain cash, intercompany, and other balance sheet currency exposures in part by entering into financial derivative contracts. In addition to the risk of non-performance by the counterparty to these contracts, our efforts to manage these risks might not be successful. We have suffered and could continue to suffer business interruptions, including impacts resulting from pandemics, weather conditions, and natural catastrophic events, including those caused or intensified by climate change and global warming, and other macroeconomic factors. Our operations and those of our suppliers and customers, and the supply chains that support their operations, have been and may be in the future vulnerable to interruption by natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons, tornados, or floods, which may be exacerbated by the effects of climate change; other disasters such as fires, explosions, acts of terrorism, or war, including the continuing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine resulting from Russia s invasion of Ukraine or escalating tensions in surrounding countries; disease or other adverse health developments, including impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic; or failures of management information or other systems due to internal or external causes. These events could cause some of our operations to suffer from supply chain disruptions and potential delays in fulfilling customer orders or order cancellations altogether, lost business and sales, changing costs or availability of insurance, and/or property damage or harm to our people, each and all of which could have an adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, such interruptions could result in a widespread crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our end customers products. If a business interruption occurs and we are unsuccessful in our continuing efforts to minimize the impact of these events, our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. The COVID-19 pandemic had a global impact and resulted in business slowdowns or shutdowns, including systemic disruptions of global supply chains. While the pandemic impacted certain aspects of our business, the extent to which the pandemic will continue to impact our business and the markets we serve will depend on future developments which may include the resurgence of the spread of the virus and variant strains of the virus as well as the success of public health advancements. Certain of our operations in China were impacted in early fiscal 2023 and were shut down for a period of time in fiscal 2022; however, we do not expect the pandemic to have a significant impact on our businesses globally in the near term. We could be adversely affected by a decline in the market value of our pension plans investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets. Concerns about deterioration in the global economy, together with concerns about credit, inflation, or deflation, have caused and could continue to cause significant volatility in the price of all securities, including fixed income and equity securities, which has reduced and could further reduce the value of our pension plans investment portfolios. In addition, the expected returns on plan assets may not be achieved. A decrease in the value of our pension plans investment portfolios or a reduction in returns on plan assets could require us to significantly increase funding of such obligations, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

 Disruption in credit markets and volatility in equity markets may affect our ability to access sufficient funding. The global equity markets have been volatile and at times credit markets have been disrupted, which has reduced the availability of investment capital and credit. Downgrades of sovereign debt credit ratings have similarly affected the availability and cost of capital. As a result, we may be unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow our business. Our inability to access adequate funding or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to reconsider certain projects and capital expenditures. The extent of any impact will depend on several factors, including our operating cash flows, the duration of tight credit conditions and volatile equity markets, our credit ratings and credit capacity, the cost of financing, and other general economic and business conditions. Global political, economic, and military instability could negatively affect sales or profitability. Our workforce; manufacturing, research, administrative, and sales facilities; markets; customers; and suppliers are located throughout the world. As a result, we are exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability, including: changes in global trade policies, including sanctions, tariffs, trade barriers, and trade disputes; regulations related to customs and import/export matters; variations in lengths of payment cycles and challenges in collecting accounts receivable; tax law and regulatory changes, examinations by taxing authorities, changes to the terms of income tax treaties, and difficulties in the tax-efficient repatriation of cash generated or held in a number of jurisdictions; employment regulations and local labor conditions, including increases in employment costs, particularly in low-cost regions in which we currently operate; difficulties protecting intellectual property; instability in economic or political conditions, including sovereign debt levels, Eurozone uncertainty, inflation, recession, and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, including the continuing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine resulting from Russia s invasion of Ukraine or escalating tensions in surrounding countries; the impact of the United Kingdom s withdrawal from the EU (commonly referred to as Brexit could cause disruptions to, and create uncertainty surrounding, our business, including affecting our relationships with existing and potential customers and suppliers; and the impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements. We have sizeable operations in China, including 17 principal manufacturing sites. In addition, approximately 20 of our net sales in fiscal 2023 were made to customers in China. Economic conditions in China have been, and may continue to be, volatile and uncertain. In addition, the legal and regulatory system in China continues to evolve and is subject to change. There also continues to be significant uncertainty about the relationship between the U.S. and China, including with respect to geopolitics, trade policies, treaties, government regulations, and tariffs. The current political climate has intensified concerns about trade tensions between the U.S. and China in connection with each country s recent or proposed tariffs on the other country s products. Accordingly, our operations and transactions with customers in China could be adversely affected by changes to market conditions, changes to the regulatory environment, increased trade barriers, tariffs, or restrictions, or interpretation of Chinese law. In addition, any further downgrade by rating agencies of long-term U.S. sovereign debt or downgrades or defaults of sovereign debt of other nations may negatively affect global financial markets and economic conditions, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and liquidity.

 U.S. federal tax laws could result in adverse consequences to U.S. persons treated as owning 10 or more of our shares. Although we are a Swiss corporation, application of certain U.S. tax law ownership attribution rules may cause non-U.S. subsidiaries to be treated as Controlled Foreign Corporations CFCs for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. person that is treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as owning, directly, indirectly, or constructively, 10 or more of our shares may be required to annually report and include in its U.S. taxable income its pro rata share of certain types of income earned by our subsidiaries that are treated as CFCs, whether or not we make any distributions to such U.S. shareholder. A U.S. person that owns 10 or more of our shares should consult a tax adviser regarding the potential implications. The risk of U.S. federal income tax reporting and compliance obligations with respect to our subsidiaries that are treated as CFCs may deter our current shareholders from increasing their investment in us, and others from investing in us, which could impact the demand for, and value of, our shares. We are subject to, and may continue to be subject to, incremental costs, risks, and regulations associated with efforts to combat the negative effects of climate change. There is increased public awareness regarding climate change. This increased focus has led to international treaties and agreements and legislative and regulatory efforts. We may also be subject to larger, global climate change initiatives, laws, regulations, or orders, such as any laws or regulations to implement the Paris Climate Agreement, which seek to reduce GHG emissions. In addition to government requirements, our customers are also increasingly imposing climate-related requirements on their suppliers, including us. Any failure, or perceived failure, to comply with these requirements may result in reduced demand for our products, reputational harm, or other adverse impacts to our business. Any future regulations relating to GHG emissions and/or other climate change-related laws and regulations, beyond initiatives we already have in process, could subject us to additional and/or unforeseen compliance costs and limitations, increased energy and raw material costs, and incremental capital expenditure requirements. Also, there may be additional mandatory climate-related reporting obligations, and potentially GHG emissions reduction requirements, which would likely result in increased corporate and operational general and administrative efforts and associated costs and expenses. Any future regulatory changes in any of the countries in which we operate could result in transition risks to us, including, but not limited to: (i) the nature and timing of any requirement to lower GHG emissions and adopt more energy-efficient energy use, which could result in changes or disruptions to the way we operate, (ii) financial risks where the compliance with such regulations requires unforeseen capital expenditures and becomes costly or financially burdensome, (iii) legal risks associated with the failure to adapt to or comply with future climate change-related regulations, (iv) risks of climate litigation associated with our disclosures and/or operations; (v) risks associated with the implementation of any new technologies required to comply with such regulations, which could impede our ability to innovate new products, meet customer and market demand, or compete on pricing and quality in the market, and/or (vi) reputational risks associated with our customers and investors perceptions of us and their preferences for maintaining relationships with companies with lower emissions, all of which could harm our reputation in the marketplace. Increasing scrutiny and expectations regarding environmental, social, and governance ESG matters could result in additional costs or risks or otherwise adversely impact our business. Companies across industries are facing increasing scrutiny from a variety of stakeholders related to their ESG and sustainability practices. Expectations regarding voluntary and potential mandatory ESG initiatives and disclosures may result in increased costs, changes in demand for certain products, enhanced compliance or disclosure obligations, or other adverse impacts to our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Further, our ability to achieve our current and future ESG goals is uncertain and remains subject to numerous risks, including evolving regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations, our ability to recruit, develop, and retain a diverse workforce, the availability of suppliers and other business partners that can meet our ESG expectations, the growth of our business, cost considerations, and the development and availability of cost-effective technologies or resources that support our goals. An inability to receive or maintain favorable ESG ratings could negatively impact our reputation or impede our ability to compete as effectively to attract and retain employees or customers, which may adversely impact our operations. Unfavorable ESG ratings could also lead to negative investor sentiment towards us or our industry, which could negatively impact the price of our shares as well as our access to and cost of capital.

 Risks Relating to the Industry in Which We Operate We are dependent on the automotive and other industries and significant periodic downturns have had material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We are dependent on end market dynamics to sell our products, and our operating results could be adversely affected by cyclical and reduced demand in these markets. Periodic downturns in our customers industries can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products, which has in the past and could have in the future a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Approximately 43 of our net sales for fiscal 2023 were to customers in the automotive industry. The automotive industry is dominated by large manufacturers that can exert significant price pressure on their suppliers. Additionally, the automotive industry has historically experienced significant downturns during periods of deteriorating global or regional economic or credit conditions. As a supplier of automotive electronics products, our sales of these products and our profitability have been and could continue to be negatively affected by significant declines in global or regional economic or credit conditions and changes in the operations, products, business models, part-sourcing requirements, financial condition, and market share of automotive manufacturers, as well as potential consolidations among automotive manufacturers. Further, work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by our customers in the automotive industry could result in slowdowns or closures of assembly plants where our products are included in assembled vehicles. During fiscal 2023, approximately 11 of our net sales were to customers in the industrial equipment end market and approximately 10 of our net sales were to customers in the commercial transportation end market. Demand in the industrial equipment industry is dependent upon economic conditions, including customer investment in factory and warehouse automation, process control systems, and building automation and smart city infrastructure, as well as market conditions in the rail transportation, lighting, and other major industrial markets we serve. The commercial transportation industry is impacted by the economic environment and market conditions in the heavy truck, construction, agriculture, and recreational vehicle markets. We encounter competition in substantially all areas of the electronic components industry, which has and could in the future negatively impact our prices, margins, and market share. We operate in highly competitive markets for electronic components and expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future. Our overall competitive position depends on various factors including the price, quality, and performance of our products; the level of customer service; the development of new technology; our ability to participate in emerging markets; and customers expectations relating to socially responsible operations. The competition we experience across product lines from other companies ranges in size from large, diversified manufacturers to small, highly specialized manufacturers. The electronic components industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years, and our major competitors have significant financial resources and technological capabilities. A number of these competitors compete with us primarily on price and in some instances may have the benefit of lower production costs for certain products. We cannot provide assurance that additional competitors will not enter our markets or that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors. Increased competition has and may in the future result in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We are dependent on market acceptance of our new product introductions and product innovations for future revenue and failure of such introductions or innovations in a timely manner could cause our operating results to suffer. Substantially all markets in which we operate are impacted by technological change or change in consumer tastes and preferences, which are rapid in certain end markets. Our operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually design, develop, introduce, and sell new and innovative products; to modify existing products; and to customize products to meet customer requirements driven by such change. There are numerous risks inherent in these processes, including the risk that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market profitable new products and applications in time to satisfy customer demands.

 The pace of technological change continues to accelerate and our ability to react effectively to such change may present significant competitive risks. The pace of technological change is increasing at an exponential rate. The continued creation, development, and advancement of new technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, quantum computing, data analytics, 3-D printing, robotics, sensor technology, data storage, neural networks, and augmented reality, as well as other technologies in the future that are not foreseen today, continue to transform our processes, products, and services. In order to remain competitive, we will need to stay abreast of such technologies, require our employees to continue to learn and adapt to new technologies, be able to integrate them into our current and future business models, products, services, and processes, and also guard against existing and new competitors disrupting their business using such technologies. Our strategy, value creation model, operating model, and innovation ecosystem have important technological elements and certain of our products and offerings are based on technological advances, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, advanced analytics, and the Internet of Things. Increasing use of artificial intelligence may expose us to social and ethical issues, which may result in reputational harm and liability. In addition, we will need to compete for talent in a competitive market that is familiar with such technologies including upskilling our workforce. There can be no assurance we will continue to compete effectively with our industry peers due to technological changes, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Continuing pressure to lower our prices has and may in the future result in price erosion. We have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, continuing pressure to lower our prices. Although pricing actions positively impacted our net sales in both fiscal 2023 and 2022, we have historically experienced price erosion averaging from 1 to 2 each year. To maintain our margins, we must continue to reduce our costs by similar amounts. We cannot provide assurance that continuing pressures to reduce our prices will not have a material adverse effect on our margins, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We may be negatively affected as our customers and vendors continue to consolidate. Many of the industries to which we sell our products, as well as many of the industries from which we buy materials, have become more concentrated in recent years, including the automotive, data and devices, and aerospace and defense industries. Consolidation of customers may lead to decreased product purchases from us. In addition, as our customers buy in larger volumes, their volume buying power has increased, enabling them to negotiate more favorable pricing and find alternative sources from which to purchase. Our materials suppliers similarly have increased their ability to negotiate favorable pricing. These trends have and may continue to adversely affect the margins on our products, particularly for commodity components. The life cycles of certain of our products can be very short and may not result in material revenue and may cause us to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment. The life cycles of certain of our products can be very short relative to their development cycle. As a result, the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not result in material revenue and, from time to time, we may need to write off excess or obsolete inventory or equipment. If we were to incur significant engineering expenses and investments in inventory and equipment that we were not able to recover and we were not able to compensate for those expenses, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability, warranty, and product recall claims that may be brought against us. We face exposure to product liability and warranty claims in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected, or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in death, bodily injury, and/or property damage. Further, if any of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to participate in a recall campaign, and a customer or other party may hold us responsible for some or all of the costs of these campaigns. Actual or alleged defects in our products may therefore cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair, replacement, or other costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, suffer substantial negative publicity, face challenges in our ability to timely deliver products to our customers, write-off the value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering and management personnel. Additionally, actual or alleged defects in our products could result in damage to our reputation and to our ability to

 win future business. Consequently, our costs and loss of revenue associated with product liability, warranty, and recall claims could be material to our financial position and results of operations. Risks Relating to Our Operations Our results are sensitive to raw material availability, quality, and cost and shortages, deteriorations in quality, or price increases could lead to a materially negative impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We are a large buyer of resins, chemicals, additives, and metals, including copper, gold, silver, palladium, aluminum, brass, steel, and zinc. Many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers. The prices of many of these raw materials continue to increase and fluctuations may persist in the future. In addition, feedstock for resins and resins themselves, as well as certain other commodities, are increasingly subject to varied and unrelated force majeure events worldwide further impacting price and availability. In recent years, raw material prices and availability have been affected by worldwide economic conditions, including supply chain disruptions, inflationary cost pressures, and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. If we have difficulty obtaining raw materials, the quality of available raw materials deteriorates, or there are significant price increases for these raw materials, it could have a substantial impact on the price we pay for raw materials. To the extent we cannot compensate for cost increases through productivity improvements or price increases to our customers, our margins may decline, materially affecting our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. In addition, we use financial instruments to hedge the volatility of certain commodities prices. The success of our hedging program depends on accurate forecasts of planned consumption of the hedged commodity materials. We could experience unanticipated hedge gains or losses if these forecasts are inaccurate. The SEC requires annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies which use tin, tantalum, tungsten, or gold conflict minerals or 3TG mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo DRC and adjoining countries (together with the DRC, the Covered Countries in their products. These requirements, as well as new and additional regulations like the EU s Conflict Minerals Regulation, could affect the sourcing, pricing, and availability of 3TG used in the manufacture of certain of our products, and may result in only a limited pool of suppliers which can demonstrate that they do not source any 3TG from the Covered Countries. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain non-conflict 3TG in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Further, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to meet customer non-conflict 3TG standards or sufficiently verify the origins and chain of custody for all conflict minerals used in our products through our due diligence procedures. Poor quality of components and products manufactured by third parties could harm our business. We may rely on third-party suppliers for the components used in our products, and we may rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products. Our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely affected if such third parties lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition. If these third parties fail to deliver quality products, parts, and components on time and at reasonable prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation could be damaged. Our future success is significantly dependent on our ability to attract and retain management and executive management employees. Our success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to retain our management and executive management employees and hire new management and executive management employees to replace, succeed, or add to members of our management team. Our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. Competition for management talent is intense, and any difficulties we may have to retain or hire members of management to achieve our objectives may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

 Cybersecurity incidents and other disruptions affecting our information technology infrastructure or violations of data privacy laws have and could interfere with our operations, compromise confidential information, and expose us to liability which could materially adversely impact our business and reputation. Cybersecurity attacks, threats, and breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure and/or the information technology infrastructure of our third-party suppliers or business partners could interfere with our operations; compromise information belonging to us, our employees, customers, and suppliers; and expose us to liabilities or penalties which could adversely impact our business and reputation. In the normal course of business, we rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Additionally, we collect and store certain data, including proprietary business information and customer and employee data, and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls. Specifically, we are subject to the laws of various states and countries where we operate or do business related to solicitation, collection, processing, transferring, storing, or use of consumer, customer, supplier, or employee information or related data, including the EU s General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, and China s Personal Information Protection Law. In addition, certain countries in which we operate or do business have enacted or are considering enacting laws that impose additional data transfer restrictions. If countries in which we operate or do business were to adopt data localization or data residency laws, we could be required to implement new or expand existing data storage protocols, build new storage facilities, and/or devote additional resources to comply with the requirements of such laws, any of which could have significant implications to business operations and costs. In addition to our own systems, we have outsourced, and expect to continue to outsource, certain information technology services including cloud computing services and storage systems, system development, and information technology support services which have in the past, and in the future may, subject our information technology and other sensitive information to additional risk. Our information technology networks and infrastructure, and the technology networks and infrastructure of our third-party suppliers and business partners, are vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by malicious actors with significant financial and technological resources, breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, malware (such as computer viruses and ransomware), social engineering (i.e., phishing attacks), theft of system credentials, other increasingly sophisticated attacks, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events, which may require us to notify regulators, customers, or employees, and enlist identity theft protection in the event of a privacy breach. We continue to monitor and develop our systems to protect the integrity and functionality of our information technology infrastructure and access to and the security of our intellectual property and our employees , customers , and suppliers data. Cybersecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure or the information technology infrastructure of our third-party suppliers and business partners, or violations of applicable laws, could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties, disruption in operations, and damage to our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our business. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, attacks and threats to our information technology networks and infrastructure, including attempted cyber intrusions, to date none of these attacks and threats have had a material impact on our business or operations. Further, some of our employees have fully-remote or hybrid work arrangements, which may increase our vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks. Covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us. Our five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility Credit Facility contains financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) and limits on the amount of subsidiary debt and incurrence of liens. Our outstanding notes indentures contain customary covenants including limits on incurrence of liens, sale and lease-back transactions, and our ability to consolidate, merge, and sell assets. Although none of these covenants are presently restrictive to our operations, our continued ability to meet the Credit Facility financial covenant can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant. A breach of any of our covenants could result in a default under our Credit Facility or indentures. Upon the occurrence of certain defaults under our Credit Facility and indentures, the lenders or trustee could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable, and our lenders could terminate commitments to extend further credit under our Credit Facility. If the lenders or trustee accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets or access to lenders or capital markets to repay or fund the repayment of any amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility and our other affected indebtedness. Acceleration 
 14 

Table of Contents 
 of any debt obligation under any of our material debt instruments may permit the holders or trustee of our other material debt to accelerate payment of debt obligations to the creditors thereunder. The indentures governing our outstanding senior notes contain covenants that may require us to offer to buy back the notes for a price equal to 101 of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date, upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the indentures). We cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event, which could result in a default under the notes. Any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event. The market price of our shares may fluctuate widely. The market price of our shares may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, including: our quarterly or annual earnings; quarterly or annual sales or earnings guidance that we may provide or changes thereto; actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results; volatility in financial markets and market fluctuations caused by global and regional economic conditions and investors concerns about potential risks to future economic growth; changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates; changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles; tax legislative and regulatory actions and proposals in Switzerland, the U.S., the EU, and other jurisdictions; announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; and the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies and companies that serve end markets important to our business. Risks Relating to Strategic Transactions Future acquisitions may not be successful. We regularly evaluate the possible acquisition of strategic businesses, product lines, or technologies which have the potential to strengthen our market position or enhance our existing product offerings, and we have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years. We anticipate that we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities as part of our growth strategy. We cannot provide assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with acquisition candidates in the future. We also cannot provide assurance that completed acquisitions will be successful. Likewise, from time to time, we experience difficulty and unanticipated expenses associated with purchasing and integrating acquisitions, and acquisitions do not always perform and deliver the financial benefits expected. We have also experienced challenges at times following the acquisition of a new company or business, including, but not limited to, managing the operations, manufacturing facilities, and technology; maintaining and increasing the customer base; or retaining key employees, suppliers, or distributors. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Future acquisitions could require us to issue additional debt or equity that may not be available on acceptable terms and could be dilutive. If we were to make a substantial acquisition with cash, the acquisition may need to be financed in part through funding from banks, public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or other arrangements. This acquisition financing might decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage measures. We cannot provide assurance that sufficient acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms if and when 
 15 

Table of Contents 
 required. If we were to complete an acquisition partially or wholly funded by issuing equity securities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our shares. Divestitures of some of our businesses or product lines may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. We continue to evaluate the strategic fit of specific businesses and products which may result in additional divestitures. Divestitures may result in significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Divestitures could involve additional risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products, and personnel; the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns; the disruption of our business; and the potential loss of key employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered. Risks Relating to Intellectual Property, Litigation, and Regulations Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our products and technology. The electronics industry is characterized by litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Within this industry, companies have become more aggressive in asserting and defending patent claims against competitors. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to future litigation alleging infringement or invalidity of certain of our intellectual property rights or that we will not have to pursue litigation to protect our property rights. Depending on the importance of the technology, product, patent, trademark, or trade secret in question, an unfavorable outcome regarding one of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Litigation, regulatory actions, and compliance issues have and could subject us to fines, penalties, judgments, remediation costs, and/or other requirements that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. In the normal course of business, we are or may be, from time to time, the subject of government or private litigation as a result of a number of factors and from various sources, including (i) reviews, requests for information, investigations, and proceedings (both formal and informal) by state and federal governmental agencies and (ii) litigation alleging the infringement of intellectual property rights, anti-competitive behavior, securities law violations, product liability, breach of contract, and employment-related claims. In certain circumstances, patent infringement and antitrust laws permit successful plaintiffs to recover treble damages. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management s attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. If any of our operations are found not to comply with applicable antitrust or competition laws or applicable trade regulations, our business may suffer. Our operations are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, in particular the U.S. and the EU. These laws prohibit, among other things, anticompetitive agreements and practices. If any of our commercial agreements and practices with respect to the electronic components or other markets are found to violate or infringe such laws, we may be subject to civil and other penalties. We may also be subject to third-party claims for damages. Further, agreements that infringe these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable, in whole or in part, or require modification to be lawful and enforceable. If we are unable to enforce our commercial agreements, whether at all or in material part, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely affected. We also must comply with applicable trade regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate. A small portion of our products, including defense-related products, may require governmental import and export licenses, the issuance of which may be influenced by geopolitical and other events. Any failure to maintain compliance with trade regulations could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. In this regard, we have been investigating our past compliance with relevant U.S. trade controls and have made voluntary disclosures of apparent trade controls violations to the

Table of Contents 
 U.S. Department of Commerce s Bureau of Industry and Security BIS and the U.S. State Department s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls DDTC ). We are cooperating with the BIS and DDTC on these matters, and the resulting investigations are ongoing. We have also been contacted by the U.S. Department of Justice concerning aspects of these matters. We are unable to predict the timing and final outcome of the agencies investigations. An unfavorable outcome may include fines or penalties imposed in response to our disclosures, but we are not yet able to reasonably estimate the extent of any such fines or penalties. Although we have reserved for potential fines and penalties relating to these matters based on our current understanding of the facts, the investigations into these matters have yet to be completed and the final outcome of such investigations and related fines and penalties may differ from amounts currently reserved. We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom s Bribery Act, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom s Bribery Act, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance program, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, litigation, government enforcement actions, and reputational risk. We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations in the various countries where we operate and where our products are sold. These laws and regulations govern, among other things: the generation, storage, use, and transportation and disposal of hazardous materials; emissions or discharges of substances into the environment; investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites; GHG emissions; product hazardous material content; and the health and safety of our employees. We may not have been, or we may not always be, in compliance with all environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. If we violate these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged, or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. In addition, environmental and health and safety laws are becoming more stringent, resulting in increased costs and compliance requirements. Certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation, reporting, removal, and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. Liability for investigation, reporting, removal, and remediation costs under certain regulatory regimes, such as U.S. federal and state laws, is retroactive, strict, and joint and several. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. We have received notifications from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, other environmental agencies, and third parties that conditions at a number of currently and formerly-owned or operated sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation, cleanup, and other possible remedial action and require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damage claims from such sites. We also have independently investigated various sites and determined that further investigation and/or remediation is necessary.

 While we plan for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows or that we will not be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury, property damage, and/or cleanup in the future based on our past, present, or future business activities. Our products are subject to various requirements related to chemical usage, hazardous material content, recycling, and other circular economy initiatives. The EU, China, U.S., and other jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, circular economy initiatives, and other related matters. These laws include but are not limited to the EU RoHS, End-of-Life Vehicle, and WEEE Directives; the EU REACH regulation; and the China RoHS regulation. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of our products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters. These laws continue to proliferate and expand in these and other jurisdictions to address other materials and other aspects of our product manufacturing and sale. These laws could make the manufacture or sale of our products more expensive or impossible, could limit our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions, and could result in liability for product recalls, penalties, or other claims. Risks Relating to Our Swiss Jurisdiction of Incorporation As a Swiss corporation, we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management involving the issuance of shares . As a Swiss corporation, our board of directors may not declare and pay dividends or distributions on our shares or reclassify reserves on our standalone unconsolidated Swiss balance sheet without shareholder approval and without satisfying certain other requirements. In addition, our articles of association allow us to create conditional share capital of up to 50 of the existing registered shares that may be issued only for specific purposes. As part of the Swiss corporate law reform, effective as of January 1, 2023, the concept of authorized share capital was replaced by a capital band. Under a capital band, the articles of association may authorize the board of directors for a maximum period of five years to increase the ordinary share capital registered in the commercial register to a maximum of 150 and/or reduce it to a minimum of 50 of the share capital existing at the time of the introduction of the capital band. In March 2023, our shareholders approved, for a period of one year ending March 15, 2024, our board of directors authorization to issue additional new shares to a maximum of 120 and/or reduce shares to a minimum of 80 of the existing share capital, subject to certain conditions specified in our articles of association. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and advance subscription rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of certain rights-bearing obligations from conditional share capital. Swiss law also does not provide much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares, and reserves for approval by shareholders many types of corporate actions, including the creation of shares with preferential rights with respect to liquidation, dividends, and/or voting. Moreover, under Swiss law, we generally may not issue registered shares for an amount below par value without prior shareholder approval to decrease the par value of our registered shares. Any such actions for which our shareholders must vote will require that we file a proxy statement with the SEC and convene a meeting of shareholders, which would delay the timing to execute such actions. Such limitations provide the board of directors less flexibility with respect to our capital management. While we do not believe that Swiss law requirements relating to the issuance of shares will have a material adverse effect on us, we cannot provide assurance that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders and such limitations on our capital management flexibility would make our stock less attractive to investors. We might not be able to make distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to Swiss withholding tax. We anticipate making distributions to shareholders through a reduction of contributed surplus (as determined for Swiss tax and statutory purposes) in order to make the distributions on our shares to shareholders free of Swiss withholding

 tax. Various tax law proposals in Switzerland, if passed in the future, may affect our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from Swiss withholding tax. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the legal requirements for future distributions to shareholders through dividends from contributed surplus or through a reduction of registered share capital, or that Swiss withholding rules would not be changed in the future. In addition, over the long term, the amount of registered share capital available for reductions will be limited. Our ability to pay dividends or distributions to our shareholders free from Swiss withholding tax is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices. Currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc may limit the amount available for any future distributions on our shares without subjecting shareholders to Swiss withholding tax. The registered share capital in our unconsolidated Swiss statutory financial statements is denominated in Swiss francs. Although distributions that are effected through a return of contributed surplus or registered share capital are expected to be paid in U.S. dollars, shareholder resolutions with respect to such distributions must take into account the Swiss francs denomination of the registered share capital. If the U.S. dollar were to increase in value relative to the Swiss franc, the U.S. dollar amount of registered share capital available for future distributions without Swiss withholding tax will decrease. We have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our shares. The Swiss Code of Obligations regulates a corporation s ability to hold or repurchase its own shares. We and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves (including contributed surplus as determined for Swiss tax and statutory purposes) are available. The aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10 of our registered share capital. We may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10 , however, only if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10 and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation. Our ability to repurchase our shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices that we believe is important to our shareholders, and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors. Registered holders of our shares must be registered as shareholders with voting rights in order to vote at shareholder meetings. Our articles of association contain a provision regarding voting rights that is required by Swiss law for Swiss companies like us that issue registered shares (as opposed to bearer shares). This provision provides that to be able to exercise voting rights, holders of our shares must be registered in our share register (Aktienbuch) as shareholders with voting rights. Only shareholders whose shares have been registered with voting rights on the record date may participate in and vote at our shareholders meetings, but all shareholders will be entitled to dividends, distributions, preemptive rights, advance subscription rights, and liquidation proceeds. The board of directors may, in its discretion, refuse to register shares as shares with voting rights if a shareholder does not fulfill certain disclosure requirements in our articles of association. Certain provisions of our articles of association may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that our shareholders might consider favorable. Our articles of association contain provisions that could be considered anti-takeover provisions because they would make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our incumbent board of directors. Under these provisions, among others: shareholders may act only at shareholder meetings and not by written consent, and restrictions will apply to any merger or other business combination between our company and any holder of 15 or more of our issued voting shares who became such without the prior approval of our board of directors. These provisions may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80 of our issued voting shares, which could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal or delaying, deferring, or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price, or otherwise be considered favorable by our shareholders. Our articles of association also contain provisions permitting our board of directors to issue new shares from authorized or conditional capital without shareholder approval and without regard for shareholders preemptive rights or advance subscription rights, for the purpose of the defense of an actual, threatened, or potential unsolicited takeover bid, in relation to 
 19

 which the board of directors, upon consultation with an independent financial advisor, has not recommended acceptance to the shareholders. We note that Swiss courts have not addressed whether or not a takeover bid of this nature is an acceptable reason under Swiss law for withdrawing or limiting preemptive rights with respect to authorized share capital or advance subscription rights with respect to conditional share capital. In addition, the New York Stock Exchange NYSE ), on which our shares are listed, requires shareholder approval for issuances of shares equal to 20 or more of the outstanding shares or voting power, with limited exceptions. Global legislative and regulatory actions and proposals could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate and our global cash taxes. Various legislative and regulatory proposals have been directed at multinational companies with operations in lower-tax jurisdictions. There has been heightened focus on adoption of such legislation and on other initiatives, such as: the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD and participating countries continue to work toward the enactment of a 15 global minimum corporate tax. Member states have begun to enact the rules. Swiss Parliament recently approved a constitutional amendment to implement the rules, and the amendment was approved by public vote in June 2023. We anticipate that the Swiss global minimum tax will be effective as of January 1, 2024. The global minimum tax is a significant structural change to the international taxation framework, which is expected to affect us beginning in fiscal 2025. Although global enactment has begun, the OECD and participating countries continue to work on defining the underlying rules and administrative procedures. We are currently monitoring these developments and evaluating the impact, which could be material to our results of operations, cash taxes, and worldwide corporate effective tax rate. EU and other countries initiatives to promote tax transparency and to prevent aggressive tax planning, including the European Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive. tax policy changes in the U.S., such as additional federal tax reform measures and new tax regulations. If these proposals are adopted, they may materially increase cash taxes, increase our worldwide corporate effective tax rate, cause double taxation, and increase audit risk. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals or initiatives, and we cannot provide assurance that any such legislation or initiative will not apply to us. Legislation in the U.S. could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced in recent years that may negatively impact the growth of our business by denying government contracts to U.S. companies that have moved to lower-tax jurisdictions. We expect the U.S. Congress to continue to consider implementation and/or expansion of policies that would restrict the federal and state governments from contracting with entities that have corporate locations abroad. We cannot predict the likelihood that, or final form in which, any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business, or the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that any such legislative action will not apply to us. In addition, we are unable to predict whether the final form of any potential legislation discussed above also would affect our indirect sales to U.S. federal or state governments or the willingness of our non-governmental customers to do business with us. As a result of these uncertainties, we are unable to assess the potential impact of any proposed legislation in this area and cannot provide assurance that the impact will not be materially adverse to us. Swiss law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our securities. As we are organized under the laws of Switzerland, it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in Switzerland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Switzerland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us, or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the U.S. and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Some remedies available under the laws of U.S. jurisdictions, including some remedies available under the U.S. federal securities laws, would not be allowed in Swiss courts as they are contrary to Switzerland s public policy.

 Swiss law differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. These differences include the manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest, the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits, and the scope of indemnification available to directors and officers. Thus, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the U.S. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY Not applicable. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our principal executive office is located in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. As of fiscal year end 2023, we owned approximately 17 million square feet and leased approximately 10 million square feet of aggregate floor space, used primarily for manufacturing, warehousing, and office space. We believe our facilities are suitable for the conduct of our business and adequate for our current needs. We manufacture our products in over 25 countries worldwide. Our manufacturing sites focus on various aspects of our manufacturing processes, including our primary processes of stamping, plating, molding, extrusion, beaming, and assembly. We consider the productive capacity of our manufacturing facilities sufficient. As of fiscal year end 2023, our principal centers of manufacturing output by segment and geographic region were as follows: 

Transportation Industrial Communications Solutions Solutions Solutions Total (number of manufacturing facilities) EMEA 20 20 2 42 Asia Pacific 9 6 9 24 Americas 10 26 2 38 Total 39 52 13 104 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. In addition, we operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent legal claims. At any given time in the normal course of business, we are involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions. If infringement of a third party s patent were to be determined against us, we might be required to make significant royalty or other payments or might be subject to an injunction or other limitation on our ability to manufacture or sell one or more products. If a patent owned by or licensed to us were determined to be invalid or unenforceable, we might be required to reduce the value of the patent on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and to record a corresponding charge, which could be significant in amount. Management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Environmental Matter The following information is reported in accordance with Item 103 of Regulation S-K: During fiscal 2021, we determined that the Silicon Microstructures, Inc. SMI manufacturing site in Milpitas, California historically miscalculated and inaccurately reported its sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 emissions prior to our acquisition of SMI. The site voluntarily disclosed the matter to the applicable state and local authorities, and in fiscal 2022, we received

 approval and installed new air abatement equipment at the site. In connection with an inspection of the air abatement equipment and an unrelated hazardous materials inspection during fiscal 2023, the local environmental authorities identified additional environmental deficiencies at the site. We are in the process of taking corrective actions and are fully cooperating with the authorities to ensure a satisfactory resolution of these matters. We may face monetary sanctions, although we do not anticipate such claims will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. ITEM 4.

 Overview We are a global industrial technology leader creating a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future. Our broad range of connectivity and sensor solutions, proven in the harshest environments, enable advancements in transportation, industrial applications, medical technology, energy, data communications, and the home. Summary of Fiscal 2023 Performance Our fiscal 2023 net sales decreased 1.5 from fiscal 2022 levels due to sales declines in the Communications Solutions segment, partially offset by sales increases in the Transportation Solutions segment and, to a lesser degree, the Industrial Solutions segment. On an organic basis, our net sales increased 1.0 in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022. Fiscal 2022 included an additional week which contributed 306 million in net sales. Our net sales by segment were as follows: Transportation Solutions Our net sales increased 4.0 due primarily to sales increases in the automotive end market. Industrial Solutions Our net sales increased 1.4 as a result of sales increases in the aerospace, defense, and marine, the energy, and the medical end markets, partially offset by declines in the industrial equipment end market. Communications Solutions Our net sales decreased 26.3 due to sales declines in both the data and devices and the appliances end markets. During fiscal 2023, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of 2.36 per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments of 0.59 beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and ending in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Net cash provided by operating activities was 3,132 million in fiscal 2023. 
 Economic Conditions Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions. The global economy has been impacted in recent years by supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressures as well as the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic. We are monitoring the current environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve. We have experienced inflationary cost pressures including increased costs for transportation, energy, and raw materials. However, we have been able to mitigate increased costs and supply chain disruptions through price increases or productivity. We have implemented select price increases for certain products. Also, we have taken and continue to focus on actions to manage costs, including restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives such as reducing discretionary spending and travel. Additionally, we are managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund our future capital needs. See further discussion in Liquidity and Capital Resources. We continue to monitor the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, escalating tensions in surrounding countries, and associated sanctions. We sold our business operations in Russia, and our operations in Ukraine have been reduced. Neither Russia nor Ukraine represents a material portion of our business, and the military conflict did not have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations during fiscal 2023 and 2022. The COVID-19 pandemic had a global impact and resulted in business slowdowns or shutdowns, including systemic disruptions of global supply chains. While the pandemic impacted certain aspects of our business, the extent to which the pandemic will continue to impact our business and the markets we serve will depend on future developments which may include the resurgence of the spread of the virus and variant strains of the virus as well as the success of public health advancements. Certain of our operations in China were impacted in early fiscal 2023 and were shut down for a period of time in fiscal 2022; however, we do not expect the pandemic to have a significant impact on our businesses globally in the near term.

 Outlook In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect our net sales to be approximately 3.85 billion as compared to 3.84 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Net sales increases in the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments are expected to be largely offset by sales declines in the Communications Solutions segment. We expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be approximately 1.59 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. This outlook reflects the impact of foreign currency exchange rates which is a positive impact of approximately 17 million on net sales and a negative impact of approximately 0.02 per share on earnings per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to the same period of fiscal 2023. Also, this outlook is based on foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels. Acquisitions During fiscal 2023, we acquired one business for a cash purchase price of 110 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition was reported as part of our Industrial Solutions segment from the date of acquisition. We acquired three businesses for a combined cash purchase price of 245 million, net of cash acquired, during fiscal 2022. The acquisitions were reported as part of our Communications Solutions segment from the date of acquisition. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions. Pending Acquisition In August 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we agreed to launch a public tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Schaffner Holding AG Schaffner ), a leader in electromagnetic solutions based in Switzerland, for CHF 505.00 per share in cash for a fair value of approximately CHF 320 million (equivalent to approximately 350 million). The tender offer commenced in September 2023. As of November 10, 2023, the completion of the initial offer period, the offer has been accepted for approximately 89 of Schaffner s outstanding shares. The offer is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and is expected to be settled in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Divestitures During fiscal 2023, we sold three businesses for net cash proceeds of 48 million. In connection with the divestitures, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges and a net pre-tax loss on sales, which totaled to a net charge of 9 million.

The decrease in net sales resulted primarily from the negative impact of foreign currency translation of 2.6 due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies, partially offset by organic net sales growth of 1.0 . In fiscal 2023, pricing actions positively affected organic net sales by 607 million. Fiscal 2022 included an additional week which contributed 306 million in net sales. The impact of the additional week was estimated using an average sales figure for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. See further discussion of net sales below under Segment Results. Net Sales by Geographic Region. Our business operates in three geographic regions EMEA, Asia Pacific, and the Americas and our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period. We sell our products into approximately 140 countries, and approximately 60 of our net sales were invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2023. The percentage of net sales in fiscal 2023 by major currencies invoiced was as follows:

 (1) Fiscal 2022 included an additional week. 
 In fiscal 2023, gross margin decreased 189 million as compared to fiscal 2022 due primarily to higher material and operating costs, lower volume, and the negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by the positive impact of pricing actions. We use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products, and cost of sales and gross margin are subject to variability in raw material prices. In recent years, raw material prices and availability have been affected by worldwide economic conditions, including supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressures. As a result, we have experienced shortages and price increases in some of our input materials including certain metals however, we have been able to initiate pricing actions to offset these impacts. The following table presents the average prices incurred related to copper, gold, silver, and palladium:

We expect to purchase approximately 180 million pounds of copper, 110,000 troy ounces of gold, 2.0 million troy ounces of silver, and 12,000 troy ounces of palladium in fiscal 2024.

 (1) Fiscal 2022 included an additional week. 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. In fiscal 2023, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 86 million as compared to fiscal 2022 due primarily to gains on the sale of real estate in fiscal 2022 and the impact of cost inflation, partially offset by savings attributable to restructuring actions and the positive impact of foreign currency translation.

 Restructuring and Other Charges, Net. We are committed to continuous productivity improvements, and we evaluate opportunities to simplify our global manufacturing footprint, migrate facilities to lower-cost regions, reduce fixed costs, and eliminate excess capacity. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for future growth. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, we initiated restructuring programs associated with cost structure improvements across all segments. We incurred net restructuring charges of 260 million in fiscal 2023 and net restructuring and related charges of 153 million, of which 16 million was recorded in cost of sales, in fiscal 2022. Annualized cost savings related to actions initiated in fiscal 2023 are expected to be approximately 200 million and are expected to be fully realized by the end of fiscal 2026. Cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. For fiscal 2024, we expect total restructuring charges to be approximately 100 million and total spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately 175 million. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, we recorded net charges of 77 million and 4 million, respectively, related to pre-tax impairment of held for sale businesses and loss (gain) on divestitures. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges.

Interest income increased 45 million in fiscal 2023 from fiscal 2022 due to higher interest rates as well as an increase in our cash balances held and invested. In fiscal 2023, interest expense increased 14 million as compared to fiscal 2022 primarily as a result of a higher average cost of debt due to rising interest rates, partially offset by the expansion of our cross-currency swap program that hedges our net investment in certain foreign operations. The aggregate notional value of the contracts under this program was 3,806 million at fiscal year end 2023. Under the terms of these contracts, we receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 1.6 per annum and pay no interest. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our cross-currency swap program. Other Income (Expense). We recorded net periodic pension benefit cost of 16 million and credit of 25 million in net other income (expense) in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our retirement plans. Also, in fiscal 2022, we recorded other income of 11 million related to an indemnification receivable associated with an income tax audit. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes. Income Taxes. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of items impacting income tax expense and the effective tax rate. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD and participating countries continue to work toward the enactment of a 15 global minimum corporate tax. Member states have begun to enact the rules. Swiss Parliament recently approved a constitutional amendment to implement the rules, and the amendment was approved by public vote in June 2023. We anticipate that the Swiss global minimum tax will be effective as of January 1, 2024. The global minimum tax is a significant structural change to the international taxation framework, which is expected to affect us beginning in fiscal 2025. Although global enactment has begun, the OECD and participating countries continue to work on defining the underlying rules and administrative procedures. We are currently monitoring these developments and evaluating the impact, which could be material to our results of operations, cash taxes, and worldwide corporate effective tax rate. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was 7,416 million and 7,112 million at fiscal year end 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. As of fiscal year end 2023, certain subsidiaries had approximately 38.0 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings that have been retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations, including working capital; property, plant, and equipment; intangible assets; and research and development activities. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding undistributed earnings.

Fiscal 2023 2022 (in millions) Acquisition and integration costs 3 5 Restructuring and other charges, net 45 23 Total 48 28 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our access to capital markets, money markets, or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements. We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future, including the pending acquisition of Schaffner and payment of 350 million of 3.45 senior notes due in August 2024. We may use excess cash to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program, to acquire strategic businesses or product lines, to pay dividends on our common shares, or to reduce our outstanding debt. The cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial markets and respond as necessary to changing conditions. We believe that we have sufficient financial resources and liquidity which will enable us to meet our ongoing working capital and other cash flow needs. As of fiscal year end 2023, our cash and cash equivalents were held in subsidiaries which are located in various countries throughout the world. Under current applicable laws, substantially all of these amounts can be repatriated to Tyco Electronics Group S.A. TEGSA ), our Luxembourg subsidiary, which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt, and to TE Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent company; however, the repatriation of these amounts could subject us to additional tax expense. We provide for tax liabilities on the Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to amounts that we expect to repatriate; however, no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations. As of fiscal year end 2023, we had approximately 2.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits, principally in our subsidiaries, that we have the ability to distribute to TEGSA and TE Connectivity Ltd. but we consider to be permanently reinvested. We estimate that an immaterial amount of tax expense would be recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations, including investing and financing activities. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased 664 million to 3,132 million in fiscal 2023 as compared to 2,468 million in fiscal 2022. The increase resulted primarily from the impact of changes in working capital levels, partially offset by lower pre-tax income. The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2023 and 2022 was 425 million and 421 million, respectively.

 Pension contributions were 71 million and 42 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. We expect pension contributions to be 70 million in fiscal 2024, before consideration of any voluntary contributions. For additional information regarding pensions, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Capital expenditures were 732 million and 768 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. We expect fiscal 2024 capital spending levels to be approximately 5 of net sales. We believe our capital funding levels are adequate to support new programs, and we continue to invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities. During fiscal 2023, we acquired one business for a cash purchase price of 110 million, net of cash acquired. We acquired three businesses for a combined cash purchase price of 245 million, net of cash acquired, during fiscal 2022. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions. During fiscal 2023, we received net cash proceeds of 48 million related to the sale of three businesses. We received net cash proceeds of 16 million related to the sale of two businesses during fiscal 2022. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding divestitures. Cash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization Total debt at fiscal year end 2023 and 2022 was 4,211 million and 4,206 million, respectively. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt. During fiscal 2023, TEGSA, our wholly-owned subsidiary, issued 500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50 senior notes due in February 2026. The notes are TEGSA s unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur. TEGSA has a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility Credit Facility with a maturity date of June 2026 and total commitments of 1.5 billion. The Credit Facility contains provisions that allow for incremental commitments of up to 500 million, an option to temporarily increase the financial ratio covenant following a qualified acquisition, and borrowings in designated currencies. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at fiscal year end 2023 or 2022. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of TEGSA, (1) the term secured overnight financing rate Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Facility), (2) an alternate base rate equal to the highest of (i) Bank of America, N.A. s base rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 1 / 2 of 1 , and (iii) the Term SOFR for a one-month interest period plus 1 , (3) an alternative currency daily rate, or (4) an alternative currency term rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee. Based on the applicable credit ratings of TEGSA, this fee ranges from 5.0 to 12.5 basis points of the lenders commitments under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of fiscal year end 2023, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future. Periodically, TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are backed by the Credit Facility. At fiscal year end 2023, TEGSA had 330 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 5.50 . TEGSA had 370 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 3.45 at fiscal year end 2022.

 TEGSA s payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd. Payments of common share dividends to shareholders were 725 million and 685 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding dividends on our common shares. In March 2023, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of 2.36 per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments of 0.59 per share beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and ending in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Future dividends on our common shares, if any, must be approved by our shareholders. In exercising their discretion to recommend to the shareholders that such dividends be approved, our board of directors will consider our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, statutory requirements of applicable law, contractual restrictions, and other factors that they may deem relevant. We repurchased approximately 8 million of our common shares for 946 million and approximately 10 million of our common shares for 1,409 million under the share repurchase program during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. At fiscal year end 2023, we had 735 million of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Summarized Guarantor Financial Information As discussed above, our senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are issued by TEGSA and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by TEGSA s parent, TE Connectivity Ltd.

The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2024 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

 In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not expect that these uncertainties will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. At fiscal year end 2023, we had outstanding letters of credit, letters of guarantee, and surety bonds of 198 million, including letters of credit of 29 million associated with our divesture of the Subsea Communications business. In addition, at fiscal year end 2023, we had 27 million of performance guarantees associated with that divestiture. We contractually agreed to continue to honor letters of credit and performance guarantees related to the business projects that existed as of the date of sale; however, based on historical experience, we do not anticipate having to perform on these guarantees. Commitments and Contingencies The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non-cancelable leases, and other material obligations at fiscal year end 2023: 

Payments Due In Fiscal 2024 Thereafter Total (in millions) Long-term debt: Principal payments (1) 682 3,564 4,246 Interest payments on debt (2) 110 666 776 Operating leases (3) 118 314 432 Purchase obligations (4) 859 60 919 Total contractual cash obligations (5)(6)(7) 1,769 4,604 6,373 

 (1) See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt. (2) Interest payments exclude the impact of interest rate swap and cross-currency swap contracts. Interest payments on debt are projected for future periods using rates in effect as of fiscal year end 2023 and are subject to change in future periods. (3) Operating leases represents the undiscounted lease payments. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding leases. (4) Purchase obligations consist primarily of commitments for purchases of goods and services. (5) The above table does not reflect unrecognized income tax benefits of 454 million and related accrued interest and penalties of 65 million, the timing of which is uncertain. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding unrecognized income tax benefits, interest, and penalties. (6) The above table does not reflect pension obligations to certain employees and former employees. We are obligated to make contributions to our pension plans; however, we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type, including timing, interest rate charges, investment performance, and amounts of benefit payments. We expect to contribute 70 million to pension plans in fiscal 2024, before consideration of any voluntary contributions. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments. (7) The above table does not reflect redeemable noncontrolling interests of 104 million associated with our First Sensor AG First Sensor subsidiary. Noncontrolling interest holders can elect either (1) to remain First Sensor noncontrolling interest shareholders and receive recurring annual compensation of 0.56 per First Sensor share or (2) to put their First Sensor shares in exchange for compensation of 33.27 per First Sensor share. The ultimate amount and timing of any future cash payments is uncertain. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding redeemable noncontrolling interests . 
 Legal Proceedings In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and

 use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Trade Compliance Matters We have been investigating our past compliance with relevant U.S. trade controls and have made voluntary disclosures of apparent trade controls violations to the U.S. Department of Commerce s Bureau of Industry and Security BIS and the U.S. State Department s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls DDTC ). We are cooperating with the BIS and DDTC on these matters, and the resulting investigations are ongoing. We have also been contacted by the U.S. Department of Justice concerning aspects of these matters. We are unable to predict the timing and final outcome of the agencies investigations. An unfavorable outcome may include fines or penalties imposed in response to our disclosures, but we are not yet able to reasonably estimate the extent of any such fines or penalties. Although we have reserved for potential fines and penalties relating to these matters based on our current understanding of the facts, the investigations into these matters have yet to be completed and the final outcome of such investigations and related fines and penalties may differ from amounts currently reserved. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Management s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Revenue Recognition We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue is recognized as performance obligations under the terms of a contract, such as a purchase order with a customer, are satisfied; generally this occurs with the transfer of control. We transfer control and recognize revenue when we ship product to our customers, the customers accept and have legal title for the product, and we have a right to payment for such product. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products and excludes taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from customers concurrent with the sale of products. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales. Since we typically invoice our customers when we satisfy our performance obligations, we do not have material contract assets or contract liabilities. Our credit terms are customary and do not contain significant financing components that extend beyond one year of fulfillment of performance obligations. We apply the practical expedient of ASC 606 with respect to financing components and do not evaluate contracts in which payment is due within one year of satisfaction of the related performance obligation. Since our performance obligations to deliver products are part of contracts that generally have original durations of one year or less, we have elected to use the optional exemption to not disclose the aggregate amount of transaction prices associated with unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations. Our standard terms of sale generally warrant that our products will conform to our, or mutually agreed to, specifications and that our products will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship for a limited time. In certain instances, we may sell products to customers under terms other than our standard terms. We do not account for warranties as separate performance obligations. Although products are generally sold at fixed prices, certain distributors and customers receive incentives or awards, such as sales rebates, return allowances, scrap allowances, and other rights, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts in the same period revenue is recognized based on the expected value to be provided to customers and reduce revenue accordingly. Our estimates of variable consideration and ultimate determination of the estimated amounts to include in the transaction price are based primarily on our assessment of anticipated performance and historical and forecasted information that is reasonably available to us.

 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other . Intangible assets include both indeterminable-lived residual goodwill and determinable-lived identifiable intangible assets. Intangible assets with determinable lives primarily include intellectual property, consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology, and customer relationships. Recoverability estimates range from 1 to 50 years and costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis. Evaluations of the remaining useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (a component if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. At fiscal year end 2023, we had five reporting units, all of which contained goodwill. There were two reporting units in both the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments and one reporting unit in the Communications Solutions segment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values. We review our reporting unit structure each year as part of our annual goodwill impairment test, or more frequently based on changes in our structure. Goodwill impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. In assessing a potential impairment, management relies on several reporting unit-specific factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying these factors to the impairment analysis. When testing for goodwill impairment, we identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the amount of the excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Fair value estimates used in the goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The income approach is supported by a guideline analysis (a market approach). These approaches incorporate several assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax rates, and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and determined that no impairment existed. Income Taxes In determining pre-tax income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the income tax return and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of pre-tax operating income in various tax jurisdictions, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is dependent primarily on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions. Any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the 
 39 

Table of Contents 
 valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Changes in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any enacted changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. The calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes , we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances. Due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. These tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Pension Plans Our defined benefit pension plan expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions. The funded status of our plans is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at the measurement date. The projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits projected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are invested by the trustees of the funds. The benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation. Net periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants, or, for inactive plans, over the remaining life expectancy of participants. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are discount rates and expected long-term returns on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality, and employee turnover. These assumptions are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. Discount rates represent the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and are used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans. A decrease in discount rates increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. At fiscal year end 2023, a 25-basis-point decrease in discount rates would have increased the present value of our pension obligations by 60 million; a 25-basis-point increase would have decreased the present value of our pension obligations by 57 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. A 50-basis-point decrease or increase in the expected long-term returns on plan assets would have increased or decreased, respectively, our fiscal 2023 pension expense by 8 million. At fiscal year end 2023, the long-term target asset allocation in our U.S. plans master trust is 25 return-seeking assets and 75 liability-hedging assets. Asset re-allocation to meet that target is occurring over a multi-year period based on the funded status. We expect to reach our target allocation when the funded status of the plans exceeds 110 . Based on the funded status of the plans as of fiscal year end 2023, our target asset allocation is 67 return-seeking and 33 liability-hedging.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measure Organic Net Sales Growth (Decline) We present organic net sales growth (decline) as we believe it is appropriate for investors to consider this adjusted financial measure in addition to results in accordance with GAAP. Organic net sales growth (decline) represents net sales growth (decline) (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months, if any. Organic net sales growth (decline) is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management s control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity. Organic net sales growth (decline) provides useful information about our results and the trends of our business. Management uses this measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Also, management uses this measure together with GAAP financial measures in its decision-making processes related to the operations of our reportable segments and our overall company. It is also a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The tables presented in Results of Operations and Segment Results provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth (decline) to net sales growth (decline) calculated in accordance with GAAP. Organic net sales growth (decline) is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered a replacement for results in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results. This limitation is best addressed by using organic net sales growth (decline) in combination with net sales growth (decline) to better understand the amounts, character, and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts.

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks, including market risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency movements on outstanding debt and non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities and commodity price movements. We utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions to manage a portion of these risks. We do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Substantially all counterparties to derivative financial instruments are limited to major financial institutions with at least an A/A2 credit rating. There is no significant concentration of exposures with any one counterparty. Foreign Currency Exposures As part of managing the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we utilize cross-currency swap contracts and foreign currency forward contracts, a portion of which are designated as cash flow hedges. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany and other cash transactions. In addition, we utilize cross-currency swap contracts to hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations. A 10 appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our cross-currency swap contracts or foreign currency forward contracts from the fiscal year end 2023 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our contracts by 368 million. A 10 appreciation or depreciation of the underlying currency in our cross-currency swap contracts or foreign currency forward contracts from the fiscal year end 2022 market rates would have changed the unrealized value of our contracts by 151 million. Such gains or losses on these contracts would generally be offset by the losses or gains on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions. Interest Rate and Investment Exposures We issue debt, as needed, to fund our operations and capital requirements. Such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure. To manage the interest rate exposure, we use interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of fixed rate debt into variable rate debt. Also, we may use forward starting interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt. There were no such contracts and no floating debt outstanding at fiscal year end 2023 or 2022. We utilize investment swap contracts to manage earnings exposure on certain nonqualified deferred compensation liabilities. Commodity Exposures Our worldwide operations and product lines may expose us to risks from fluctuations in commodity prices. To limit the effects of fluctuations in the future market price paid and related volatility in cash flows, we utilize commodity swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges. We continually evaluate the commodity market with respect to our forecasted usage requirements over the next eighteen months and periodically enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge a portion of usage requirements over that period. At fiscal year end 2023, our commodity hedges, which related to expected purchases of gold, silver, copper, and palladium, were in a net loss position of 23 million and had a notional value of 459 million. At fiscal year end 2022, our commodity hedges, which related to expected purchases of gold, silver, copper, and palladium, were in a net loss position of 82 million and had a notional value of 566 million. A 10 appreciation or depreciation of commodity prices from the fiscal year end 2023 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 44 million. A 10 appreciation or depreciation of commodity prices from the fiscal year end 2022 prices would have changed the unrealized value of our forward contracts by 48 million. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding financial instruments.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 29, 2023. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 29, 2023. Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 29, 2023.

 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate. Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2023, which is included in this Annual Report. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the quarter ended September 29, 2023, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of TE Connectivity Ltd. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TE Connectivity Ltd. and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2023, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 13, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Income Taxes Realizability of Deferred Tax Assets Refer to Notes 2 and 15 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company recognizes deferred income taxes for temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character prior to expiration. Sources of taxable income include future reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities, expected future taxable income, taxable income in prior carryback years if permitted under the tax law, and tax planning strategies. Management has determined that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to 
 56 

Table of Contents 
 realize a portion of its deferred tax assets, and therefore, a valuation allowance of 7.4 billion has been recorded to offset the Company s gross deferred tax assets as of September 29, 2023 of 10.2 billion. We identified the realizability of certain deferred tax assets as a critical audit matter because of the Company s tax structure and the significant judgments and estimates made by management to determine that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future prior to expiration to realize a portion of its deferred tax assets. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our income tax specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the appropriateness of qualifying tax planning strategies and the reasonableness of management s estimates of taxable income prior to expiration. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the determination that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize certain deferred tax assets included the following, among others: 
 We tested the effectiveness of controls over management s estimates of the realization of the deferred tax assets, including those over the estimates of taxable income, the approval of tax planning strategies and the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized prior to expiration. We evaluated the reasonableness of management s assessment of the significance and weighting of negative evidence and positive evidence that is objectively verifiable. We evaluated management s ability to accurately estimate taxable income by comparing actual results to management s historical estimates and evaluating whether there have been any changes that would impact management s ability to continue accurately estimating taxable income. We tested the reasonableness of management s estimates of taxable income by comparing the estimates to: 
 
 Historical taxable income. Internal communications to management and the board of directors. Management s history of carrying out its stated plans and its ability to carry out its plans considering contractual commitments, available financing, or debt covenants. 
 
 We evaluated whether the estimates of future taxable income were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. We evaluated whether the taxable income in prior carryback years was of the appropriate character and available under the tax law. With the assistance of our income tax specialists, we evaluated (1) the appropriateness of qualifying tax planning strategies, including that they were prudent, feasible and would more likely than not result in the realization of deferred tax assets and (2) management s assessment that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize a portion of the deferred tax assets prior to expiration. 
 /s/ November 13, 2023 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2007.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of TE Connectivity Ltd. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of TE Connectivity Ltd. and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 29, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2023, of the Company and our report dated November 13, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte Touche LLP Philadelphia, Pennsylvania November 13, 2023

 of satisfaction of the related performance obligation. Since our performance obligations to deliver products are part of contracts that generally have original durations of or less, we have elected to use the optional exemption to not disclose the aggregate amount of transaction prices associated with unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations. See Note 20 for net sales disaggregated by industry end market and geographic region which is summarized by segment and that we consider meaningful to depict the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows affected by economic factors. Our standard terms of sale generally warrant that our products will conform to our, or mutually agreed to, specifications and that our products will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship for a limited time. In certain instances, we may sell products to customers under terms other than our standard terms. We do not account for warranties as separate performance obligations. Amounts accrued for warranty claims were million at both fiscal year end 2023 and 2022. Although products are generally sold at fixed prices, certain distributors and customers receive incentives or awards, such as sales rebates, return allowances, scrap allowances, and other rights, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts in the same period revenue is recognized based on the expected value to be provided to customers and reduce revenue accordingly. Our estimates of variable consideration and ultimate determination of the estimated amounts to include in the transaction price are based primarily on our assessment of anticipated performance and historical and forecasted information that is reasonably available to us. for land improvements, 5 to for buildings and improvements, and 1 to for machinery and equipment. We periodically evaluate, when events and circumstances warrant, the net realizable value of property, plant, and equipment and other long-lived assets, relying on several factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, and anticipated future cash flows. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the carrying values of the asset group are evaluated in relation to the operating performance and estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying asset group. Impairment of the carrying value is recognized whenever anticipated future undiscounted cash flow estimates are less than the carrying value of the asset. Fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. to and costs are generally

 reporting units, all of which contained goodwill. There were reporting units in both the Transportation Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments and reporting unit in the Communications Solutions segment. When changes occur in the composition of one or more reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the reporting units affected based on their relative fair values. Goodwill impairment is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. In assessing a potential impairment, management relies on several reporting unit-specific factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying these factors to the impairment analysis. When testing for goodwill impairment, we identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the amount of the excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Fair value estimates used in the goodwill impairment tests are calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The income approach is supported by a guideline analysis (a market approach). These approaches incorporate several assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax rates, and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. million, million, and million, respectively.

Many of these costs are variable, fluctuating based on services provided, such as pallets shipped in and out of a location or square footage of space occupied. These costs, and any other variable rental costs, are excluded from our ROU assets and lease liabilities and are expensed as incurred. Some of our leases may include options to either renew or early the lease. The exercise of these options is generally at our sole discretion and would only occur if there is an economic, financial, or business reason to do so. Such options are included in the lease term if we determine it is reasonably certain they will be exercised.

TEGSA ), our wholly-owned subsidiary, issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in February 2026. The notes are TEGSA s unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur. TEGSA has a unsecured senior revolving credit facility Credit Facility with a maturity date of June 2026 and total commitments of billion. The Credit Facility contains provisions that allow for incremental commitments of up to million, an option to temporarily increase the financial ratio covenant following a qualified acquisition, and borrowings in designated currencies. TEGSA had borrowings under the Credit Facility at fiscal year end 2023 or 2022. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of TEGSA, (1) the term secured overnight financing rate Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Facility), (2) an alternate base rate equal to the highest of (i) Bank of America , N.A. s base rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 1 / 2 of 1 , and (iii) the Term SOFR for a one-month interest period plus , (3) an alternative currency daily rate , or (4) an alternative currency term rate , plus, in each case, an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee. Based on the applicable credit ratings of TEGSA, this fee ranges from to basis points of the lenders commitments under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.75 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. Periodically, TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are backed by the Credit Facility. TEGSA s payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by its parent, TE Connectivity Ltd.

We believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Guarantees In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and

 million, including letters of credit of million associated with our divesture of the Subsea Communications business. In addition, at fiscal year end 2023, we had million of performance guarantees associated with that divestiture. We contractually agreed to continue to honor letters of credit and performance guarantees related to the business projects that existed as of the date of sale; however, based on historical experience, we do not anticipate having to perform on these guarantees. . During fiscal 2015, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which were designated as cash flow hedges, to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain intercompany loans. As of fiscal year end 2022, all such cross-currency swap contracts had been terminated or matured and were settled; additionally, all related collateral positions were settled. During fiscal 2023, we did not enter into any cross-currency swap contracts and there were amounts outstanding. The impacts of our cross-currency swap contracts were as follows: ) Gains (losses) excluded from the hedging relationship (1) ) Gains reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) into selling, general, and administrative expenses 

 (1) Gains and losses excluded from the hedging relationship are recognized prospectively in selling, general, and administrative expenses and are offset by losses and gains generated as a result of re-measuring certain intercompany loans to the U.S. dollar. 
 Hedge of Net Investment We hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations using intercompany loans and external borrowings denominated in the same currencies. The aggregate notional value of these hedges was million and million at fiscal year end 2023 and 2022, respectively. We also use a cross-currency swap program to hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations. The aggregate notional value of the contracts under this program was million and million at fiscal year end 2023 and 2022, respectively. Under the terms of these contracts, we receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of per annum and pay interest. Upon the maturity of these contracts at various dates through fiscal 2027, we will pay the notional value of the contracts in the designated foreign currency and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties. We are not required to provide collateral for these contracts.

 Interest Rate and Investment Risk Management We issue debt, as needed, to fund our operations and capital requirements. Such borrowings can result in interest rate exposure. To manage the interest rate exposure, we use interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of fixed rate debt into variable rate debt. We may utilize forward starting interest rate swap contracts to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt. During fiscal 2022, we terminated forward starting interest rate swap contracts as a result of the issuance of our senior notes due in 2032. During fiscal 2023, we did not enter into any forward starting interest rate swap contracts and there were amounts outstanding. The impacts of our forward starting interest rate swap contracts were as follows: We also utilize investment swap contracts to manage earnings exposure on certain nonqualified deferred compensation liabilities. Commodity Hedges As part of managing the exposure to certain commodity price fluctuations, we utilize commodity swap contracts. The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in prices of commodities used in production. These contracts had an aggregate notional value of million and million at fiscal year end 2023 and 2022, respectively, and were designated as cash flow hedges. These commodity swap contracts were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows: Accrued and other current liabilities Other liabilities

 (1) Includes amounts reflected as settlement and curtailment losses (gains) in the above net periodic pension benefit cost (credit) table. 
 In fiscal 2022, unrecognized actuarial gains recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were primarily the result of higher discount rates, partially offset by unfavorable asset performance for our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans as compared to fiscal 2021. In determining the expected returns on plan assets, we consider the relative weighting of plan assets by class and individual asset class performance expectations. The investment strategies for non-U.S. and U.S. pension plans are governed locally. Our investment strategy for our pension plans is to manage the plans on a going concern basis. Current investment policy is to achieve a reasonable return on assets, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for participants. Projected returns are based primarily on pro forma asset allocation, expected long-term returns, and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. At fiscal year end 2023, the long-term target asset allocation in our U.S. plans master trust is return-seeking assets and liability-hedging assets. Return-seeking assets, including non-U.S. and U.S. equity securities, are assets intended to generate returns in excess of pension liability growth. Liability-hedging assets, including government and corporate bonds, are assets intended to have characteristics similar to pension liabilities and are used to better match asset cash flows with expected obligation cash flows. Asset re-allocation to meet that target is occurring over a multi-year period based on the funded status. We expect to reach our target allocation when the funded status of the plans exceeds . Based on the funded status of the plans as of fiscal year end 2023, our target asset allocation is return-seeking and liability-hedging. Target weighted-average asset allocation and weighted-average asset allocation for non-U.S. and U.S. pension plans were as follows: Fixed income Other Total

 million and million to our non-U.S. and U.S. pension plans, respectively, in fiscal 2024. We may also make voluntary contributions at our discretion. At fiscal year end 2023, benefit payments, which reflect future expected service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows: Fiscal 2025 Fiscal 2026 Fiscal 2027 Fiscal 2028 Fiscal 2029-2033 Presented below is the accumulated benefit obligation for all non-U.S. and U.S. pension plans as well as additional information related to plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets and plans with a projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets. Pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets: Accumulated benefit obligation Fair value of plan assets Pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets: Projected benefit obligation Fair value of plan assets We value our pension assets based on the fair value hierarchy of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures . Details of the fair value hierarchy are described in Note 2. The following table presents our defined benefit pension plans asset categories and their associated fair value within the fair value hierarchy: Fixed income: Commingled fixed income funds (2) Other (3) Subtotal Items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets (4) Fair value of plan assets

 Fixed income: Commingled fixed income funds (2) Other (3) Subtotal Items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets (4) Fair value of plan assets 

 (1) Commingled equity funds are pooled investments in multiple equity-type securities. Fair value is calculated as the closing price of the underlying investments, an observable market condition, divided by the number of shares of the fund outstanding. (2) Commingled fixed income funds are pooled investments in multiple fixed income-type securities. Fair value is calculated as the closing price of the underlying investments, an observable market condition, divided by the number of shares of the fund outstanding. (3) Other investments are composed of insurance contracts, derivatives, short-term investments, structured products such as collateralized obligations and mortgage- and asset-backed securities, real estate investments, and hedge funds. Insurance contracts are valued using cash surrender value, or face value of the contract if a cash surrender value is unavailable (level 2), as these values represent the amount that the plan would receive on termination of the underlying contract. Derivatives, short-term investments, and structured products are marked to fair value using models that are supported by observable market-based data (level 2). Real estate investments include investments in commingled real estate funds and are valued at net asset value which is calculated using unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity (level 3). Hedge funds are valued at their net asset value which is calculated using unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity (level 3). (4) Items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets include certain investments containing no significant redemption restrictions that were measured at net asset value NAV using the NAV practical expedient available in ASC 820 and amounts receivable or payable for unsettled transactions and cash balances, both of which are considered to be carried at book value. 
 Defined Contribution Retirement Plans We maintain several defined contribution retirement plans, the most significant of which is located in the U.S. These plans include 401(k) matching programs, as well as qualified and nonqualified profit sharing and share bonus retirement plans. Expense for the defined contribution plans is computed as a percentage of participants compensation and was million, million, and million for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Deferred Compensation Plans We maintain nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which permit eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation. A record-keeping account is set up for each participant and the participant chooses from a variety of measurement funds for the deemed investment of their accounts. The measurement funds correspond to several funds in our 401(k) plans and the account balance fluctuates with the investment returns on those funds. At fiscal year end 2023 and 2022, total deferred compensation liabilities were million and million, respectively, and were recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 13 for additional information regarding our risk management strategy related to deferred compensation liabilities. Postretirement Benefit Plans In addition to providing pension and 401(k) benefits, we also provide certain health care coverage continuation for qualifying retirees from the date of retirement to age 65 or lifetime, as applicable.

As we are entitled to indemnification of pre-acquisition period tax obligations under the terms of the purchase agreement, we recorded an associated indemnification receivable and other income of million during fiscal 2022. The income tax expense for fiscal 2021 included a million income tax benefit related to changes in valuation allowances, of which million related to the net reduction in valuation allowances associated primarily with certain tax planning actions as well as improved current and expected future operating profit and taxable income. In addition, the income tax expense for fiscal 2021 included a million income tax benefit related to an Internal Revenue Service approved change in the tax method of depreciating or amortizing certain assets and million of income tax expense associated with the tax impacts of an intercompany transaction. Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes. The components of the net deferred income tax asset were as follows: Tax loss and credit carryforwards Inventories Intangible assets Pension and postretirement benefits Deferred revenue Interest Lease liabilities Other Gross deferred tax assets Valuation allowance ) ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance Deferred tax liabilities: Property, plant, and equipment ) ) Write-down of investments in subsidiaries ) ) Lease ROU assets ) ) Other ) ) Total deferred tax liabilities ) ) Net deferred tax assets

 Tax credit carryforwards U.S. State: Net operating loss carryforwards Tax credit carryforwards Non-U.S.: Net operating loss carryforwards Tax credit carryforwards Capital loss carryforwards Total tax loss and credit carryforwards The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of million and million at fiscal year end 2023 and 2022, respectively, related principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. During fiscal 2023, we completed tax returns for certain non-U.S. entities which resulted in the recognition of additional deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards of million. As we do not expect these subsidiaries to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets, we recognized a corresponding increase to the valuation allowance. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the income tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries earnings that are expected to be distributed in the future. No additional provision has been made for Swiss or non-Swiss income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. As of fiscal year end 2023, certain subsidiaries had approximately billion of cumulative undistributed earnings that have been retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global manufacturing operations, including working capital; property, plant, and equipment; intangible assets; and research and development activities. A liability could arise if our intention to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries. As of fiscal year end 2023, we had approximately billion of cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits, principally in our subsidiaries, that we have the ability to distribute to TEGSA, our Luxembourg subsidiary, which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt, and to TE Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent company, but we consider to be permanently reinvested. We estimate that an immaterial amount of tax expense would be recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements if our intention to permanently reinvest these amounts were to change. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash, cash equivalents, and intercompany deposits that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations, including investing and financing activities.

We record accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense (benefit). As of fiscal year end 2023 and 2022, we had million and million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, recorded primarily in income taxes. During fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, we recognized income tax expense of million, million, and million, respectively, related to interest and penalties on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We file income tax returns on a unitary, consolidated, or stand-alone basis in multiple state and local jurisdictions, which generally have statutes of limitations ranging from 3 to . Various state and local income tax returns are currently in the process of examination or administrative appeal. Our non-U.S. subsidiaries file income tax returns in the countries in which they have operations. Generally, these countries have statutes of limitations ranging from 3 to . Various non-U.S. subsidiary income tax returns are currently in the process of examination by taxing authorities.

 In most jurisdictions, taxing authorities retain the ability to review prior tax years and to adjust any net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards from these years that are utilized in a subsequent period. Although it is difficult to predict the timing or results of our worldwide examinations, we estimate that approximately million of unrecognized income tax benefits, excluding the impact relating to accrued interest and penalties, could be resolved within the next twelve months. We are not aware of any other matters that would result in significant changes to the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of fiscal year end 2023. Dilutive impact of share-based compensation arrangements Diluted The following share options were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the instruments underlying exercise prices were greater than the average market prices of our common shares and inclusion would be antidilutive:

 of our authorized shares. As part of the Swiss corporate law reform, effective as of January 1, 2023, the concept of a capital band was introduced. Under a capital band, the articles of association may authorize the board of directors for a maximum period of five years to increase the ordinary share capital registered in the commercial register to a maximum of 150 and/or reduce it to a minimum of 50 of the share capital existing at the time of the introduction of the capital band. In March 2023, our shareholders approved, for a period of ending March 15, 2024, our board of directors authorization to issue additional new shares to a maximum of and/or reduce shares to a minimum of of the existing share capital, subject to certain conditions specified in our articles of association. Common Shares Held in Treasury At fiscal year end 2023, approximately million common shares were held in treasury, of which million were owned by one of our subsidiaries. At fiscal year end 2022, approximately million common shares were held in treasury, of which million were owned by one of our subsidiaries. Shares held both directly by us and by our subsidiary are presented as treasury shares on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, our shareholders approved the cancellation of eight and a half million, million, and million shares, respectively, purchased under our share repurchase program. These capital reductions by cancellation of shares were subject to a notice period, filing with the commercial register in Switzerland, and other requirements. Contributed Surplus As a result of cumulative equity transactions, including dividend activity and treasury share cancellations, our contributed surplus balance was reduced to zero with residual activity recorded against accumulated earnings as reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Shareholders Equity. To the extent that the contributed surplus balance continues to be zero, the impact of future transactions that normally would have been recorded as a reduction of contributed surplus will be recorded in accumulated earnings. Contributed surplus established for Swiss tax and statutory purposes Swiss Contributed Surplus is not impacted by our GAAP treatment. Swiss Contributed Surplus, subject to certain conditions, is a freely distributable reserve. As of fiscal year end 2023 and 2022, Swiss Contributed Surplus was CHF million and CHF million, respectively (equivalent to million and million, respectively). Dividends We paid cash dividends to shareholders of , , and per share in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Under Swiss law, subject to certain conditions, dividends paid from reserves from capital contributions (equivalent to Swiss Contributed Surplus) are exempt from Swiss withholding tax. Dividends on our shares must be approved by our shareholders.

Share Repurchase Program In fiscal 2022, our board of directors authorized increases of billion in our share repurchase program. Common shares repurchased under the share repurchase program were as follows: Repurchase value At fiscal year end 2023, we had million of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization.

The noncontrolling interest holders can elect either (1) to remain First Sensor shareholders and receive recurring annual compensation of per First Sensor share or (2) to put their First Sensor shares in exchange for compensation of per First Sensor share. As the exercise of the put right by First Sensor noncontrolling interest shareholders is not within our control, our First Sensor noncontrolling interest balance is recorded as redeemable noncontrolling interest outside of equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of fiscal year end 2023 and 2022.

Based on our performance, the pay-out of performance share units can range from to of the number of units originally granted. The grant-date fair value of performance share awards is expensed over the period of performance once achievement of the performance criteria is deemed probable. Recipients of performance share units have no voting rights but do receive dividend equivalents.

Exhibit 4.1 Description of Securities Registered Pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 As of November 13, 2023, TE Connectivity Ltd., a Swiss corporation, had one class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ): Common Shares, par value CHF 0.57 per share (the Common Shares ). The following summary includes a brief description of the Common Shares, as well as certain related additional information. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to we, us, our and the Company refer to TE Connectivity Ltd. Share Capital Our share capital is CHF 183,808,060.17, which is divided into 322,470,281 registered shares with a par value of CHF 0.57 each. Capital Band Our Articles of Association Articles authorize our board of directors any time until March 15, 2024 to increase and/or reduce the share capital once or several times within the upper limit of CHF 220,569,672.09, corresponding to 386,964,337 registered shares with a par value of CHF 0.57 each, and the lower limit of CHF 147,046,448.25, corresponding to 257,976,225 registered shares with a par value of CHF 0.57 each. Conditional Share Capital Our Articles provide that the share capital of the Company shall be increased by an amount not exceeding CHF 91,904,029.80 through the issuance of a maximum of 161,235,140 registered shares, payable in full, with a par value of CHF 0.57 each: through the exercise of conversion, option, exchange, warrant or similar rights for the subscription of shares granted to third parties or shareholders in connection with bonds (including convertible bonds and bonds with options), options, warrants or other securities issued or to be issued in national or international capital markets or new or already existing contractual obligations by or of the Company, one of its group companies or any of their respective predecessors (hereinafter the Rights-Bearing Obligations and/or the exercise of rights attached to Rights-Bearing Obligations granted to members of the board of directors, members of the executive management, employees, contractors, consultants or other persons providing services to the Company, group companies or a person that directly, or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls or is controlled by, or is under common control with another person. 
 Preemptive Rights and Advance Subscription Rights Under the Swiss Code of Obligations (the Swiss Code ), the prior approval of a general meeting of shareholders generally is required to authorize the issuance of registered shares or rights to subscribe for, or convert into, registered shares. In addition, shareholders have preemptive rights or advance subscription rights (which are essentially the same as preemptive rights) in relation to such registered shares or rights in proportion to the respective par values of their holdings. With the affirmative vote of shareholders holding two-thirds of the voting rights and a majority of the par value of the registered shares represented at the general meeting, shareholders may withdraw or limit the preemptive rights or advance subscription rights. Withdrawal or Limitation of Preemptive Rights with Respect to Authorized Share Capital Our board of directors is authorized pursuant to our Articles to withdraw or limit the preemptive rights with respect to the issuance of registered shares from authorized capital: 
 1 

if the issue price of the new registered shares is determined by reference to the market price; if the registered shares are issued in connection with the acquisition of an enterprise or business or any part of an enterprise, business or investment, the financing or refinancing of any such transactions; if the registered shares are issued in connection with the financing of new investment plans; if the registered shares are issued in connection with the intended broadening of the shareholder constituency in certain financial or investor markets, for the purposes of the investment of strategic partners or in connection with the listing of the registered shares on domestic or foreign stock exchanges; in connection with a placement or sale of registered shares, the grant of an over-allotment option of up to 20 of the total number of registered shares in a placement or sale of registered shares to the initial purchasers or underwriters; or for the participation of directors, executive officers, employees, contractors, consultants and other persons performing services for our benefit or that of our subsidiaries and affiliates. 
 Withdrawal or Limitation of Advance Subscription Rights with Respect to Conditional Share Capital In connection with the issuance of Rights-Bearing Obligations convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for our registered shares, our board of directors is authorized pursuant to our Articles to withdraw or limit the advance subscription rights of shareholders with respect to registered shares issued from our conditional share capital: if the issuance is for purposes of financing or refinancing the acquisition of an enterprise, part(s) of an enterprise, investments in equity or other investments; if the issuance occurs in national or international capital markets or through a private placement; or for purposes of the defense of an actual, threatened or potential unsolicited takeover bid, in relation to which our board of directors, upon consultation with an independent financial adviser, has not recommended acceptance to the shareholders. 
 If the advance subscription rights are withdrawn or limited: the Rights-Bearing Obligations shall be issued or entered into at market conditions; the Rights-Bearing Obligations may be converted, exchanged or exercised during a maximum period of 30 years from the date on which the Rights-Bearing Obligations are issued; and the conversion, exchange or exercise price of the Rights-Bearing Obligations is to be set at least in line with the market conditions prevailing at the date on which the Rights-Bearing Obligations are issued. 
 Preemptive and advance subscription rights are excluded with respect to issuances from our conditional share capital to directors, officers, employees and other persons providing services to any of our subsidiaries or affiliates. Dividends and Distributions Rights Under Swiss law, dividends may be paid only if the Company has sufficient distributable profits from the previous fiscal year, or if the corporation has freely distributable reserves, each as presented on the audited annual unconsolidated Swiss statutory balance sheet of the Company. Reserves from capital contributions (as determined 
 2 

for Swiss tax purposes) qualify as freely distributable reserves and may be paid out as dividends to shareholders subject to certain conditions and to the extent permissible under the Swiss Code. Payments out of the registered share capital the aggregate par value of a company s registered share capital must be made by way of a capital reduction. The affirmative vote of shareholders holding a majority of the registered shares represented at a general meeting must approve reserve reclassifications and distributions of dividends. Distributions also may take the form of a distribution of cash or property that results in a reduction of our share capital recorded in the commercial register. Such a capital reduction requires the affirmative vote of shareholders holding a majority of the registered shares represented at the general meeting. A special audit report must confirm that creditors claims remain fully covered by assets despite the reduction in the share capital recorded in the commercial register. Upon approval by the general meeting of shareholders of the capital reduction, the board of directors must give public notice of the capital reduction resolution in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce three times and notify creditors that they may request, within two months of the third publication, satisfaction of or security for their claims. Under the Swiss Code, if our general reserves amount to less than 20 of the share capital recorded in the commercial register, then at least 5 of our annual profit must be retained as general reserves. The Swiss Code permits us to accrue additional general reserves. In addition, we are required to create a special reserve on our stand-alone annual statutory balance sheet in the amount of the purchase price of registered shares that any of our subsidiaries own and this amount may not be used for dividends or subsequent repurchases. Swiss corporations generally must maintain a separate company, unconsolidated statutory balance sheet for the purpose of determining the amounts available for the return of capital to shareholders, including by way of a distribution of dividends. Our auditor must confirm that a dividend proposal made to shareholders conforms with the requirements of the Swiss Code and our Articles. Dividends are due and payable in accordance with the terms of the shareholders resolution approving the payment. We make dividend payments to shareholders in US dollars. The reduction to our reserves in our Swiss statutory balance sheet, which is required to be made in Swiss francs, is determined based on the aggregate amount of the dividend and converted from US dollars to Swiss francs at the exchange rate in effect on the date of the relevant shareholder resolution. We are required under Swiss law to make any distributions which are in the form of a capital reduction out of registered share capital as denominated in Swiss francs. Voting Rights Each registered share carries one vote at a general meeting of shareholders. Pursuant to our Articles, shareholders generally pass resolutions and elect directors and auditors by the affirmative vote of an absolute majority of the registered shares represented at the general meeting of shareholders unless otherwise provided by law or our articles of association. An absolute majority means at least half plus one additional vote represented at the meeting. With respect to the election of directors, each holder of registered shares entitled to vote at the election has the right to vote, in person or by proxy, the number of registered shares held by him or her and entitled to vote for as many persons as there are directors to be elected. 
 3 

Supermajority Voting The Swiss Code and our Articles require the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the share votes and a majority of the par value of the registered shares, each as represented at a general meeting, to approve the following matters: change of the Company s purpose; the creation of shares with preferred voting rights; the restriction on the registration of shares; an authorized or conditional increase in the nominal share capital; an increase in the nominal share capital through the conversion of capital surplus, through a contribution in kind, or in exchange for an acquisition of assets, or a grant of special privileges; the restriction or withdrawal of preemptive or advance subscription rights; a change in our place of incorporation; our dissolution; and a merger, demerger, conversion or other transaction as enumerated in Switzerland s Federal Act on Mergers, Demergers, Transformations and the Transfer of Assets (the Merger Act to the extent required by the Merger Act. 
 In addition, the amendment of certain provisions of our Articles requires the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the share votes represented and a majority of the par value of the registered shares represented, and in certain instances, the affirmative vote of 80 of the total votes of shares entitled to vote. Rights upon Liquidation; Restrictions on Transfer Under Swiss law, any surplus arising out of liquidation, after the settlement of all claims of all creditors, will be distributed to shareholders in proportion to the paid-up par value of registered shares held, subject to Swiss withholding tax requirements. We have not imposed any restrictions applicable to the transfer of our registered shares. No Redemption or Conversion The registered shares are not convertible into shares of any other class or series or subject to redemption either by us or by the holder of the shares. Mergers and Other Business Combinations Our Articles require a special supermajority for any resolution of the general meeting of shareholders to engage in a business combination with an interested shareholder (one who acquired 15 or more of the share capital recorded in the commercial register without prior approval of the board of directors) for a period of three years following the time that such person became a 15 shareholder, subject to certain exceptions discussed below. 
 4 

The supermajority required is the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the shares entitled to vote which are not owned by the interested shareholder. Such a vote will not be required if: the board of directors approved the business combination prior to the time the shareholder became an interested shareholder; or upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the shareholder becoming an interested shareholder, the interested shareholder owned at least 85 of the voting shares outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the voting shares outstanding (but not the outstanding voting shares owned by the interested shareholders) those shares owned (i) by persons who are directors and also officers and (ii) employee share plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer. 
 Certain Other Provisions of Our Articles of Association Our Articles include the following provisions, not previously discussed above, that may have an effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company: (i) an advance notice procedure for shareholders to nominate directors or present other proposals at general meetings; and (ii) shareholders may act only at shareholder meetings and not by written consent. The foregoing summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Articles and Organizational Regulations of the Company, each of which are exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K. We encourage you to read both as well as the applicable provisions of the Swiss Code.

TE CONNECTIVITY SUPPLEMENTAL SAVINGS AND RETIREMENT PLAN ARTICLE I Purpose
 1.1 Supplemental Savings and Retirement Plan . The name of this plan is the TE Connectivity Supplemental Savings and Retirement Plan (prior to January 1, 2017, the Tyco Electronics Corporation Supplemental Savings and Retirement Plan) (the Plan ). The Plan was originally effective as of the separation of Tyco Electronics Ltd. and its underlying Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 2.11(a)) from the Tyco International Ltd. controlled group of corporations (the Separation ), which occurred on June 29, 2007 Original Effective Date ). The Plan was created as a spin-off from and was a continuation of the Tyco Supplemental Savings and Retirement Plan Tyco SSRP with respect to the Accounts of certain Participants who were aligned with the Tyco Electronics business unit in conjunction with the Separation. The Plan was also created to provide certain of the key employees of the Company and the key employees of its parents, Subsidiaries and affiliates with the ability to defer receipt of compensation that would otherwise be payable to them and to make up for amounts that could not be contributed on their behalf as matching contributions under the TE Connectivity Retirement Savings and Investment Plan (f/k/a the Tyco Electronics Corporation Retirement Savings and Investment Plan) due to certain restrictions applicable under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). This amendment and restatement of the Plan, effective as of January 1, 2022 (the Restated Effective Date ), is intended, except for amounts that were deferred and vested as of December 31, 2004, to be interpreted and applied so as to comply in all respects with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and regulations and rulings promulgated thereunder and, if necessary, any provision shall be held null and void to the extent such provision (or part thereof) fails to comply with Section 409A or the regulations promulgated thereunder. 
 Effective January 1, 2017, the name of the Company, Tyco Electronics Corporation, changed to TE Connectivity Corporation, and the name of the Plan was changed to the TE Connectivity Supplemental Savings and Retirement Plan. These name changes have no impact on the benefits accrued, eligibility of persons to participate in the Plan, or rights of Participants under the Plan. 1.2 Benefits Under the Tyco SSRP and the Plan . With respect to each Participant (or Beneficiary, as applicable) who participated in the Tyco SSRP prior to the Separation and who was aligned with the Tyco Electronics business unit, Tyco International Management Company transferred from the Tyco SSRP to such Participant s or Beneficiary s Account under the Plan an amount equal to the value of the notional accounts credited to the Participant or Beneficiary under the Tyco SSRP immediately prior to such transfer. Benefits for any Participant or Beneficiary that were credited under the Tyco SSRP prior to the Original Effective Date and that were transferred to this Plan will be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Tyco SSRP (and, if applicable, under the Tyco Deferred Compensation Plan for deferrals prior to January 1, 2005), but paid under this Plan unless modifications to such transferred benefits are specifically provided herein or by a subsequent amendment to this Plan, or if an election contemplated under Section 10.21 is made available. Benefits credited on and after the Original Effective Date and before the Restated Effective Date shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this Plan as originally adopted on June 29, 2007 and any administrative actions taken thereunder to comply in good faith with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and rulings promulgated thereunder, unless modifications to such benefits are specifically provided herein or by a subsequent amendment to this Plan, or if an election contemplated under Section 

 1 

10.21 is made available. Benefits credited on and after the Restated Effective Date shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this Plan as amended and restated herein. 
 1.3 Transfer of Accounts as a Result of the BNS Divesture . Effective as of the closing date of the corporate transaction described in the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement by and among TE Connectivity, Ltd., CommScope Holding Company, Inc., and CommScope, Inc. dated January 27, 2015 (the BNS Divestiture ), the Accounts of Plan participants in the Broadband Network Solutions business unit who are terminated as a result of the BNS Divestiture will be transferred out of the Plan to the plan established by CommScope, Inc. to receive such accounts. 
 1.4 Changes to the Plan as the Result of Changes to the Matching Contribution Structure of the Tyco Electronics Corporation Retirement Savings and Investment Plan . The RSIP (as defined in Section 2.36) was amended, effective January 1, 2016, to provide Non-Standard Matching Contribution Structures for certain acquired business units or Affiliated Companies that are different from the Standard Matching Contribution Structure under the RSIP. The Plan was amended to provide that employees (who would otherwise be Eligible Employees) of any business unit or Affiliated Company that adopts a Non-Standard Matching Contribution Structure rather than the Standard Matching Contribution Structure will be excluded from participation in the Plan, until the Annual Enrollment Period coincident with or immediately following the date the business unit or the Affiliated Company adopts the Standard Matching Contribution Structure or the employee transfers to another business unit or Affiliated Company that provides the Standard Matching Contribution Structure. 
 1.5 Plan Amendments . The Plan is amended, generally effective January 1, 2022, except as otherwise specified, to (i) provide, effective January 1, 2023, that short-term disability pay is not Base Pay under the Plan; and (ii) make certain clarifying changes. The Plan was previously amended, generally effective September 1, 2021, to make certain clarifying changes. The Plan was previously amended, generally effective January 1, 2021, to reflect that RSIP Elections will be determined based on both the Participant s pre-tax and/or Roth percentage election in the RSIP. The Plan was previously amended, generally effective January 1, 2018, to incorporate prior amendments, to change the name of the Plan from the Tyco Electronics Corporation Supplemental Savings and Retirement Plan to the TE Connectivity Supplemental Savings and Retirement Plan (effective January 1, 2017), to automatically extend eligibility to Eligible Employees in Band 4.1, and to provide that Company contributions will only be made to Participants who are actively participating in the Plan. 
 1.6 Deferred Compensation Plan . The Company intends that the Plan shall at all times be maintained on an unfunded basis for federal income tax purposes under the Code, and administered as a non-qualified, top hat plan exempt from the substantive requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ERISA ). The provisions of this Plan shall apply to Base Salary Deferrals, Bonus Compensation Deferrals, Spillover Deferrals, Matching Credits, Company Credits and Discretionary Credits, and to any earnings credited thereon.

 5.3 Deferral Limits . The Plan Administrator may change the minimum or maximum deferral percentages from time to time. Any such limits shall be communicated by the Plan Administrator prior to the due date for the Enrollment and Payment Agreement. Amounts deferred under this Plan will not constitute compensation for any Company-sponsored qualified retirement plan. 
 5.4 Period of Commitment . A Participant s Enrollment and Payment Agreement as to a Compensation Deferral shall remain in effect only for the immediately succeeding Plan or Fiscal Year (or the remainder of the current year, as applicable), unless the Plan Administrator determines in its sole discretion to begin treating Participant elections as evergreen (i.e., as continuing in effect until affirmatively revoked), with such determination to be made prior to the beginning of the applicable Plan Year and Fiscal Year for which it is effective and with affected Participants being provided reasonable advance notice such that they can timely elect to discontinue or change their prior elections. 
 5.5 Change of Status . Effective January 1, 2023, a Participant s Compensation Deferrals for a Plan Year or Fiscal Year shall be suspended for the remainder of such Plan Year or Fiscal Year (i) if the Participant incurs an unforeseeable emergency (as defined in Section 8.6) during such Plan Year or Fiscal Year, (ii) if the Participant is granted a hardship withdrawal under the RSIP during such Plan Year or Fiscal Year, or (iii) there occurs any other circumstance determined by the Plan Administrator that would comply with the applicable requirements under Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and rulings promulgated thereunder.

 11 

Year unless otherwise permitted by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion (but, in such case, in no event later than the December 31 immediately preceding the first day of such Plan Year). Such election shall be deemed an irrevocable commitment by such Participant to defer hereunder a percentage of his or her periodic Compensation equal to the Participant s RSIP Election for such Plan Year, with such deferrals commencing at the time the Participant s pretax and Roth RSIP contributions are suspended for the Plan Year as the result of the imposition of any limitation under the RSIP or applicable law or any procedure established by the Plan Administrator in accordance with applicable law and continuing for the remainder of the Plan Year; provided that a Participant who elects to make Spillover Deferrals will be deemed to have made a commitment to maintain his or her RSIP Election in effect for the entire Plan Year (up to the time of such suspension) without change. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent necessary, the Plan Administrator may permit an Administrative Error Correction. 6.2 Matching Credits . An Eligible Employee who has elected to make Compensation Deferrals for a Plan Year shall receive Matching Credits, equal to the Participant s Maximum Matching Percentage multiplied by (i) the dollar amount of the Participant s Compensation Deferrals under Section 5.1 for such Plan Year on Compensation up to the applicable annual dollar limitation set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the Code, and (ii) the amount of Compensation for such Plan Year from which Spillover Deferrals (if any) are made under Section 6.1 (disregarding any such Compensation that exceeds the applicable annual dollar limitation set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the Code). For purposes of this Section 6.2, the Participant s Maximum Matching Percentage each payroll period during the Plan Year will equal the matching percentage credited to the Participant s tax-deferred contributions and Roth contributions under RSIP during that same period. If the Participant is deferring amounts under this Plan, but is not making tax-deferred or Roth contributions to the RSIP during a particular payroll period, then the Maximum Matching Percentage for that payroll period shall be the lowest matching percentage available under RSIP; provided, however, that any Participant who, during the Plan Year, transfers to a business unit or to an Affiliated Company that has adopted a Non-Standard Matching Contribution Structure, and by reason of such transfer is no longer an Eligible Employee, shall continue to have the same Maximum Matching Percentage apply that was in effect prior to the transfer for the remainder of the Plan Year during which the Participant has an irrevocable deferral election but is not otherwise an Eligible Employee. Matching Credits shall be credited to a Participant s Account at such time or times as may be determined by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion, but in no event less frequently than annually. 
 6.3 Company Credits . A Participant who has elected to make Compensation Deferrals for a Plan Year shall receive Company Credits for such Plan Year in an amount equal to the Participant s Maximum Matching Percentage for such Plan Year multiplied by the Participant s Compensation in excess of the annual dollar limitation set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the Code for such Plan Year; provided, however, that no Company Credit will be made to a Participant unless the Participant is actively participating in the Plan by making Compensation Deferrals. For purposes of this Section 6.3, the Participant s Maximum Matching Percentage will equal the matching percentage credited to the Participant s tax-deferred contributions and Roth contributions under RSIP at the point that either the Section 402(g) limit is reached or the Section 401(a)(17) limit is exceeded; provided, however, that any Participant who, during the Plan Year, transfers to a business unit or to an Affiliated Company that has adopted a Non-Standard Matching Contribution Structure, and by reason of such transfer is no longer an Eligible Employee, shall continue to have the same Maximum Matching Percentage apply that was in effect prior to the transfer for the remainder of the Plan Year during which the Participant has an irrevocable deferral election but is not otherwise an Eligible Employee. Company Credits shall be 

 12 

credited to a Participant s Account at such time or times as may be determined by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion, but in no event less frequently than annually, as of the last day of a Plan Year. A Participant who has elected to make Compensation Deferrals for a Plan Year, and who receives a Company Credit for such Plan Year, shall have the portion of his or her Account attributable to such Company Credit, if vested, distributed as specified in his or her Enrollment and Payment Agreement for such Plan Year. Prior to the Restated Effective Date, a Participant who has not elected to make Compensation Deferrals for a Plan Year, but who receives a Company Credit for such Plan Year (and has not previously received any Company Credit under the Plan), shall file with the Plan Administrator an Enrollment and Payment Agreement as soon as practicable (but no later than 30 days) after becoming eligible for such Company Credit, electing the timing and form of payment of the portion of the Participant s Account attributable to such Company Credit, if vested. Such election shall be deemed to apply also to any Company Credit received in any future Plan Year for which the Participant does not have in effect an Enrollment and Payment Agreement. If such Participant does not file an Enrollment and Payment Agreement by the date specified by the Plan Administrator, he or she shall be deemed to have elected to have the portion of his or her Account attributable to such Company Credit, and each Company Credit received in a future Plan Year for which the Participant does not have in effect an Enrollment and Payment Agreement, paid (if vested) as a Specified Date Payment in a single lump sum in the fifth Plan Year following the Plan Year for which each such Company Credit was received .
 6.4 Discretionary Credits . A Participant who is an Eligible Employee for any Plan Year may receive a Discretionary Credit for such Plan Year. Such credit shall be in such amount as may be determined by the Company in its sole discretion, and shall be credited to the Participant s Account at such time or times as may be determined by the Company in its sole discretion. A Participant who has elected to make Compensation Deferrals for a Plan Year, and who receives a Discretionary Credit for such Plan Year, shall have the portion of his or her Account attributable to such Discretionary Credit (if vested) distributed as specified in his or her Enrollment and Payment Agreement for such Plan Year. A Participant who has not elected to make Compensation Deferrals for a Plan Year, but who receives a Discretionary Credit for such Plan Year (and has not previously received any Discretionary Credit under the Plan), shall file with the Plan Administrator an Enrollment and Payment Agreement as soon as practicable (but no later than 30 days) after becoming eligible for such Discretionary Credit, electing the timing and form of payment of the portion of the Participant s Account attributable to such Discretionary Credit (if vested). Such election shall be deemed to apply also to any Discretionary Credit received in any future Plan Year for which the Participant does not have in effect an Enrollment and Payment Agreement. If such Participant does not file an Enrollment and Payment Agreement by the date specified by the Plan Administrator, he or she shall be deemed to have elected to have the portion of his or her Account attributable to such Discretionary Credit, and each Discretionary Credit received in a future Plan Year for which the Participant does not have in effect an Enrollment and Payment Agreement, paid (if vested) as a Specified Date Payment in a single lump sum in the fifth Plan Year following the Plan Year for which each such Discretionary Credit was received. 
 6.5 Vesting of Matching, Company and Discretionary Credits . Effective October 1, 2017, Participants who are actively employed on or after September 29, 2017 shall become 100 vested in their past and future Matching Credits and Company Credits (subject to Section 10.12). Prior to October 1, 2017, subject in each case to Section 10.12, a Participant became 100 vested in Matching Credits and Company Credits (i) upon the completion of three Years of Service (subject to Section 10.12); (ii) if he or she had a Separation from Service by reason of his or her death, Disability or Retirement; (iii) upon the occurrence of a Change of Control; or (iv) under such other circumstances as are deemed appropriate by the Company. The portion of a Participant Account attributable to Discretionary Credits 

 13 

shall become 100 vested upon the date and/or upon the occurrence of the event(s) specified by the Company in its sole discretion (subject to Section 10.12). 
 ARTICLE VII Participant Account

Compensation Deferrals pursuant to Section 5.1 and Spillover Deferrals pursuant to Section 6.1 shall be credited by the Plan Administrator to the Participant s Account as soon as practicable after the date on which such Compensation would otherwise have been paid, in accordance with the Participant s election. The Participant s Account shall be reduced by the amount of payments made to the Participant or the Participant s Beneficiary pursuant to this Plan and by any forfeitures. 
 7.2 Earnings (or Losses) on Account .

A Participant s Account shall be credited with all deemed earnings (or losses) generated by the Measurement Funds, as elected by the Participant, on each business day for the sole purpose of determining the amount of earnings to be credited or debited to such Account as if the designated balance of the Account had been invested in the applicable Measurement Fund. Notwithstanding that the rates of return credited to a Participant s Accounts are based upon the actual performance of the corresponding Measurement Funds, the Company shall not be obligated to invest any amount credited to a Participant s Account under this Plan in such Measurement Funds or in any other investment funds. Upon notice to the Plan Administrator in the manner it prescribes, a Participant may reallocate the Measurement Funds to which his or her Account is deemed to be allocated. 
 7.3 Valuation of Account . The value of a Participant s Account as of any date shall equal the amounts theretofore credited to such Account, including any earnings (positive or negative) deemed to be earned on such Account in accordance with Section 7.2, less the amounts theretofore deducted from such Account. 
 7.4 Statement of Account .

If a payment is not made by the designated payment date under the Plan, the payment shall be made no later than December 31 of the calendar year in which the designated payment date occurs. 
 7.6 Separate Accounting . If and to the extent required for the proper administration of the vesting or payments provisions of the Plan, the Plan Administrator may segregate a Participant s Account into 

 14 

subaccounts on the books and records of the Plan, all of which subaccounts shall, together, constitute the Participant s Account. 
 ARTICLE VIII Payments to Participants

A Separation Payment shall be made, or shall commence, within 60 days after March 1 of the year following the year in which the Participant s Separation from Service Date occurs. A Specified Date Payment shall be made, or shall commence, within 60 days of the March 1 st of the payment year designated by the Participant in the applicable Enrollment and Payment Agreement, which year shall (A) be no earlier than the year following the year in which the Participant becomes fully vested in Matching and/or Company Credits under Section 6.5 and (B) be no later than the year following the year in which the Participant attains age 70. A Conditional Specified Date Payment shall be made, or shall commence, within 60 days of the March 1 st of the year following the year in which the applicable payment trigger occurs. For the avoidance of doubt, any Specified Date Payment elected prior to October 1, 2017 that references the date the Participant is vested shall be interpreted to mean the date the Participant would have been vested based on the Plan s vesting schedule at the time the Specified Date Payment was elected. The changes to the Plan s vesting schedule, effective October 1, 2017, shall not change or accelerate any Specified Payment Date. 
 8.2 Change in Election .

A Participant s reemployment following the commencement of installment payments shall not cause any suspension or interruption in such installment payments. The provisions of this Section 8.2 shall apply to all change elections made on or after January 1, 2009; change elections made prior to such date shall be governed by Section 10.2. 
 8.3 Cash-Out Payments .

 8.5 Valuation of Payments . Any lump sum benefit under Sections 8.1, 8.2 or 8.3 shall be payable in an amount equal to the value of the Participant s Account (or relevant portion thereof) as of the trading day immediately preceding the relevant payment date, with the Measurement Funds being deemed to have been liquidated on that date to make the payment. The first annual installment payment in a series of installment payments shall be equal to (i) the value of the Participant s Account (or relevant portion thereof) as of the trading day immediately preceding the relevant payment date, with the Measurement Funds being deemed to have been liquidated on that date to make the payment, divided by (ii) the number of installment payments elected by the Participant. The remaining installments shall be paid in an amount equal to (a) the value of such Account (or relevant portion thereof) as of the trading day immediately preceding the relevant payment date, with the Measurement Funds being deemed to have been liquidated on that date to make the payment, divided by (b) the number of remaining unpaid installment payments.

 8.7 Withholding Taxes .

Each Participant, however, shall be responsible for the payment of all individual tax liabilities relating to any such benefits. 
 8.8 Effect of Payment . The full payment of the applicable benefit under this ARTICLE VIII shall completely discharge all obligations on the part of the Company to the Participant (and each Beneficiary) with respect to the operation of this Plan, and the Participant s (and Beneficiary s) rights under this Plan shall terminate. 
 8.9 Facility of Payment . Whenever, in the Plan Administrator s opinion, a person entitled to receive any payment of a benefit or installment thereof is under a legal disability or is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his financial affairs, the Plan Administrator may direct the application of the payment for the benefit of such person in such a manner as the Plan Administrator considers advisable (e.g., the payment may be made to a guardian, conservator, or other legal representative or to an individual or institution entrusted with the care of the individual or the individual s beneficiary (as applicable) or to a parent or grandparent, provided that (1) the Plan Administrator determines, in its 

 16 

discretion, that the payment will benefit the Participant or Beneficiary, (2) no other individual or institution is guardian, conservator, attorney-in-fact, or other legal representative, and (3) no prior claim has been made by a guardian, conservator, attorney-in-fact, or other legal representative). The Plan Administrator may require submission of documentation by the representative. If the representative wishes to act under a power of attorney, the power of attorney must be submitted for the Plan Administrator s review. The Plan Administrator cannot recognize a power of attorney unless it complies with the Plan s requirements. Any benefit payable to or for the benefit of a Participant, a Beneficiary, a minor, an incompetent person or other person incapable of receipting therefor shall be deemed paid when paid to such person s legal representative, guardian, committee appointed for such Participant or Beneficiary, or to the party providing or reasonably appearing to provide for the care of such person, and such payment (which may be in installments) shall fully discharge the Plan Administrator, all Employers, and all other parties with respect thereto. The Plan Administrator may require such Participant, legal representative, Beneficiary, guardian or committee, as a condition precedent to such payment, to execute a receipt and release thereof in such form as shall be determined by the Employer. 
 8.10 Special Payment Rules for Tyco Deferred Compensation Plan DCP Accounts . Unless a Participant has made a revised election under Section 8.2 or 10.21, payment of the Participant s account attributable to amounts that were previously deferred under the DCP will be made or commence at the time specified under the terms of the DCP, but the form of payment will be governed by the terms of the election made by the Participant with respect to the account, notwithstanding DCP rules that would invalidate the form of payment, provided, however, that the value of the Participant s Account balance is at least 10,000. 
 8.11 Aggregation of Account Balance Plans . Pursuant to Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(c)(2), all account balance plans, as defined in Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-1(c)(2)(A)(1)-(2), including the Plan, shall be treated as deferred under a single plan.

to 30 days. The Plan Administrator will provide the Claimant with a notice of the extension before the end of the initial 45-day period. If the Plan Administrator determines that a decision cannot be made within the first 30-day extension due to matters beyond the control of the Plan Administrator, the period for making a determination may be further extended for an additional 30 days. If such an additional extension is necessary, the Plan Administrator shall notify the Claimant prior to the expiration of the initial 30-day extension. Any notice of extension shall indicate the circumstances necessitating the extension of time, the date by which the Plan Administrator expects to furnish a notice of decision, the standards on which entitlement to a benefit is based, the unresolved issues that prevent a decision on the claim, and any additional information needed to resolve those issues. A Claimant will be provided a minimum of 45 days to submit any necessary additional information to the Plan Administrator. In the event that a 30-day extension is necessary due to a Claimant s failure to submit information necessary to decide a claim, the period for furnishing a notice of decision shall be tolled from the date on which the notice of the extension is sent to the Claimant until the earlier of the date the Claimant responds to the request for additional information or the response deadline.

A Claimant (or his or her authorized representative) who timely requests a review of the denied claim may review, upon request and free of charge, copies of all documents, records and other information relevant to the denial and may submit written comments, documents, records and other information relevant to the claim to the Plan Administrator. All written comments, documents, records, and other information shall be considered relevant if the information (a) was relied upon in making a benefits determination; (b) was submitted, considered or generated in the course of making a benefits decision regardless of whether it was relied upon to make the decision; or (c) demonstrates compliance with administrative processes and safeguards established for making benefit decisions. The Plan Administrator may, in its sole discretion and if it deems appropriate or necessary, decide to hold a hearing with respect to the claim appeal.

Appeal of a denied benefits claim (other than a Disability benefits claim) must be filed in writing with the Plan Administrator no later than 60 days after receipt of the written notification of such claim denial. The Plan Administrator shall make its decision regarding the merits of 

 18 

the denied claim within 60 days following receipt of the appeal (or within 120 days after such receipt in a case where there are special circumstances requiring an extension of time for reviewing the appealed claim). If an extension of time for reviewing the appeal is required, notice of the extension shall be furnished to the Claimant prior to the commencement of the extension. The notice will indicate the special circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which the Plan Administrator expects to render the determination on review. The review will take into account comments, documents, records and other information submitted by the Claimant relating to the claim without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. 
 (b) Disability Benefits . Appeal of a denied Disability benefits claim must be filed in writing with the Plan Administrator no later than 180 days after receipt of the notification of such claim denial. The review shall be conducted by the Plan Administrator (exclusive of the person who made the initial adverse decision or such person s subordinate). In reviewing the appeal, the Plan Administrator shall (1) not afford deference to the initial denial of the claim, (2) consult a medical professional who has appropriate training and experience in the field of medicine relating to the Claimant s disability and who was neither consulted as part of the initial denial nor is the subordinate of such individual, and (3) identify the medical or vocational experts whose advice was obtained with respect to the initial benefit denial, without regard to whether the advice was relied upon in making the decision. The Plan Administrator shall make its decision regarding the merits of the denied claim within 45 days following receipt of the appeal or within 90 days after such receipt, in a case where there are special circumstances requiring an extension of time for reviewing the appealed claim. If an extension of time for reviewing the appeal is required because of special circumstances, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the Claimant prior to the commencement of the extension. The notice will indicate the special circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which the Plan Administrator expects to render the determination on review. Following its review of any additional information submitted by the Claimant, the Plan Administrator shall render a decision on its review of the denied claim. 
 (c) Contents of Notice . If a benefits claim is completely or partially denied on review, notice of such denial shall set forth the reasons for denial in language calculated to be understood by the Participant. 
 (i) The decision on review shall set forth (a) the specific reason or reasons for the denial; (b) specific reference(s) to the relevant provision(s) of this Plan on which the denial is based; (c) a statement that the Claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of all documents, records, or other information relevant (as defined above) to the Claimant s claim; and (d) a statement of the Claimant s right to bring an action under Section 502(a) of ERISA.
 (ii) For the denial of a Disability benefit, the notice will also include a statement that the Plan Administrator will provide, upon request and free of charge, (a) any internal rule, guideline, protocol or other similar criterion relied upon in making the decision; and (b) any medical opinion relied upon to make the decision.
 9.3 Legal Action . A Claimant may not bring any legal action relating to a claim for benefits under the Plan unless and until the Claimant has followed the claims procedures under the Plan and exhausted his or her administrative remedies under such claims procedures. 

 19 

9.4 Discretion of the Plan Administrator . All interpretations, determinations and decisions of the Plan Administrator with respect to any claim shall be made in its sole discretion, and shall be final and conclusive. 
 9.5 Burden of Proof Regarding Records . The records of the Company and any Affiliated Company with respect to length of employment, employment history, compensation, absences from employment and all other relevant matters may be conclusively relied on by the Plan Administrator for purposes of determining an individual s eligibility or entitlement to Plan benefits, the amount of Plan benefits payable to an individual, the appropriate timing of payment of Plan benefits to an individual, and so forth. If an individual claiming benefits under the Plan believes those records are incorrect, the individual may provide documentation supporting his or her position to the Plan Administrator for review and consideration. However, the decision of the Plan Administrator with respect to any records dispute shall be final and binding on all parties. 
 The Company, Affiliated Companies, the Plan Administrator, and all other persons or entities associated with the operation of the Plan, the management of its assets, and the provision of benefits thereunder, may reasonably rely on the truth, accuracy and completeness of all data provided by any Participant or Beneficiary, including, without limitation, data with respect to age, health and marital status. Furthermore, the Company, Affiliated Companies, and the Plan Administrator and all other persons or entities associated with the operation of the Plan, its assets and the benefits provided under the Plan may reasonably rely on all consents, elections and designations filed with the Plan or those associated with the operation of the Plan and its corresponding trust by any Participant, the spouse of any Participant, any Beneficiary of any Participant, or the representatives of such persons without duty to inquire into the genuineness of any such consent, election or designation. None of the aforementioned persons or entities associated with the operation of the Plan, its assets and the benefits provided under the Plan shall have any duty to inquire into any such data, and all may rely on such data being current to the date of reference, it being the duty of the Participants, spouses of Participants, and Beneficiaries to advise the appropriate parties of any change in such data. ARTICLE X Miscellaneous
 10.1 Protective Provisions . Each Participant and Beneficiary shall cooperate with the Plan Administrator by furnishing any and all information requested by the Plan Administrator in order to facilitate the payment of benefits hereunder. If a Participant or Beneficiary refuses to cooperate with the Plan Administrator, the Company shall have no further obligation to the Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan, other than payment of the then-current balance of the Participant s Accounts in accordance with prior elections and subject to Section 10.12.
 10.2 Inability to Locate Participant or Beneficiary . In the event that the Plan Administrator is unable to locate a Participant or Beneficiary within two years following the date the Participant was to commence receiving payment, the entire amount allocated to the Participant s Account shall be forfeited. If, after such forfeiture, the Participant or Beneficiary later claims such benefit, such benefit shall be reinstated without interest or earnings from the date payment was to commence pursuant to ARTICLE VIII. 
 10.3 Designation of Beneficiary . Each Participant may designate in writing a Beneficiary or Beneficiaries (which Beneficiary may be an entity other than a natural person if approved by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion) to receive any payments that may be made under the Plan following the Participant s death. No Beneficiary designation shall become effective until it is in writing and it is 

 20 

filed with the Plan Administrator. A Beneficiary designation under the Plan may be separate from all other retirement-type plans sponsored by the Company. Such designation may be changed or canceled by the Participant at any time without the consent of any such Beneficiary. Any such designation, change or cancellation must be made in a form approved by the Plan Administrator and shall not be effective until received by the Plan Administrator or its designee. If no Beneficiary has been named, or the designated Beneficiary or Beneficiaries have predeceased the Participant, the Beneficiary shall be the Participant s estate. If a Participant designates more than one Beneficiary, the interests of such Beneficiaries shall be paid in equal shares, unless the Participant has specifically designated otherwise. 
 10.4 No Contract of Employment . Neither the establishment of the Plan, nor any modification thereof, nor the creation of any fund, trust or account, nor the payment of any benefits shall be construed as giving any Participant, or any person whosoever, the right to be retained in the service of the Company, and all Participants and other employees shall remain subject to discharge to the same extent as if the Plan had never been adopted. 
 10.5 No Limitation on Company Actions . Nothing contained in the Plan shall be construed to prevent the Company from taking any action that is deemed by it to be appropriate or in its best interest. No Participant, Beneficiary, or other person shall have any claim against the Company as a result of such action. 
 10.6 Obligations to Company . If a Participant becomes entitled to a payment of benefits under the Plan, and if at such time the Participant has outstanding any debt, obligation, or other liability representing an amount owing to the Company, then the Company may offset such amount owed to it against the amount of benefits otherwise distributable; provided, however, that such deductions cannot exceed 5,000 in the aggregate. Such determination shall be made by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion. 
 10.7 No Liability for Action or Omission . Neither the Company nor any director, officer or employee of the Company shall be responsible or liable in any manner to any Participant, Beneficiary or any person claiming through them for any benefit or action taken or omitted in connection with the granting of benefits, the continuation of benefits, or the interpretation and administration of this Plan. 
 10.8 Non-Alienation of Benefits . Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all amounts payable hereunder shall be paid only to the person or persons designated by the Plan and not to any other person or corporation. No part of a Participant s Account shall be liable for the debts, contracts, or engagements of any Participant, or his or her Beneficiary or successors in interest, nor shall such accounts of a Participant be subject to execution by levy, attachment, or garnishment or by any other legal or equitable proceeding, nor shall any such person have any right to alienate, anticipate, commute, pledge, encumber, or assign any benefits or payments hereunder in any manner whatsoever. If any Participant, Beneficiary or successor in interest is adjudicated bankrupt or purports to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or charge any payment from the Plan, voluntarily or involuntarily, the Plan Administrator, in its discretion, may cancel such payment (or any part thereof) to or for the benefit of such Participant, Beneficiary or successor in interest in such manner as the Plan Administrator shall direct. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all or a portion of a Participant s Account may be awarded to an alternate payee (within the meaning of Section 206(d)(3)(K) of ERISA) if and to the extent so provided in a judgment, decree or order that, in the Plan Administrator s sole discretion, would meet the applicable requirements for qualification as a qualified domestic relations order (within the meaning of Section 206(d)(3)(B)(i) of ERISA) if the Plan were subject to the provisions of Section 206(d) of ERISA. Such amounts shall be payable to the alternate payee in the form of a lump 

 21 

sum distribution and shall be paid within 90 days following the Plan Administrator s determination that the order satisfies the requirements to be a qualified domestic relations order. 
 10.9 Liability for Benefit Payments . The obligation to pay or provide for payment of a benefit hereunder to any Participant or his or her Beneficiary shall, at all times, be the sole and exclusive liability and responsibility of the company that employed the Participant immediately prior to the event giving rise to a payment obligation (the Responsible Company ). No other company or parent, affiliated, Subsidiary or associated company shall be liable or responsible for such payment, and nothing in this Plan shall be construed as creating or imposing any joint or shared liability for any such payment (other than the TEL guarantee set forth in Section 10.10 below). The fact that a company or a parent, affiliated, Subsidiary or associated company other than the Responsible Company actually makes one or more payments to a Participant or his or her Beneficiary shall not be deemed a waiver of this provision; rather, any such payment shall be deemed to have been made on behalf of and for the account of the Responsible Company. 
 10.10 TEL Guarantee . TEL guarantees the payment by the Responsible Company (as defined in Section 10.9) of any benefits provided for or contemplated under this Plan that either (i) the Responsible Company concedes are due and owing to a Participant or Beneficiary or (ii) are finally determined to be due and owing to a Participant or Beneficiary, but that in either case the Responsible Company fails to pay. 
 10.11 Unfunded Status of Plan . The Plan is intended to constitute an unfunded deferred and supplemental retirement compensation plan for Participants, with all benefits payable hereunder constituting an unfunded contractual payment obligation of the Company. Nothing contained in the Plan, and no action taken pursuant to the Plan, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind. The Company shall reflect on its books the Participants interests hereunder, but no Participant or any other person shall under any circumstances acquire any property interest in any specific assets of the Company. Nothing contained in this Plan and no action taken pursuant hereto shall create or be construed to create a fiduciary relationship between the Company and any Participant or other person. A Participant s right to receive payments under the Plan shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company. Except to the extent that the Company determines that a rabbi trust may be established in connection with the Plan, all payments shall be made from the general funds of the Company, and no special or separate fund shall be established and no segregation of assets shall be made to assure payment. The Company s obligations under this Plan are not assignable or transferable except to (i) any corporation or partnership which acquires all or substantially all of the Company s assets or (ii) any corporation or partnership into which the Company may be merged or consolidated. The provisions of the Plan shall inure to the benefit of each Participant and the Participant s Beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or successors in interest. 
 10.12 Forfeiture for Cause . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, if a Participant s employment is terminated for Cause, or if the Plan Administrator determines that a Participant who has a Separation from Service for any other reason had engaged in conduct prior to his or her Separation from Service that would have constituted Cause, then the Plan Administrator may determine in its sole discretion that such Participant s Account under the Plan shall be forfeited and shall not be payable hereunder. 
 10.13 Recovery of Overpayment . The Plan has a right of reimbursement against any person who receives or holds a payment from the Plan in excess of the amount to which a Participant, spouse, or Beneficiary is entitled under the terms of the Plan. The Plan Administrator may recover the amount 

 22 

overpaid in any manner determined by the Plan Administrator to be in the best interests of the Plan, including, but not limited to, by legal action against the recipient and/or holder of the overpayment or offset against other or future benefits payable to or with respect to the Participant, spouse, or Beneficiary under the Plan. The provisions of this Section are intended to clarify existing rights of the Plan and apply to all past or future overpayments. 
 10.14 Governing Law; Venue . This Plan shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to the extent not superseded by federal law, without reference to the principles of conflict of laws. The courts of competent jurisdiction in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania shall have exclusive jurisdiction for all claims, actions and other proceedings involving or relating to the Plan or any party in interest, including, by way of example and without limitation, a claim or action (i) to recover benefits allegedly due under the Plan or by reason of any law; (ii) to enforce rights under the Plan; (iii) to clarify rights to future benefits under the Plan; or (iv) that seeks a remedy, ruling or judgment of any kind against the Plan or a party in interest. 
 10.15 Severability of Provisions . If any provision of this Plan shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions hereof, and this Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such provisions had not been included. 
 10.16 Headings and Captions . The headings and captions herein are provided for reference and convenience only, shall not be considered part of the Plan, and shall not be employed in the construction of the Plan. 
 10.17 Gender, Singular and Plural . All pronouns and any variations thereof shall be deemed to refer to the masculine, feminine, or neuter, as the identity of the person or persons may require. As the context may require, the singular may read as the plural and the plural as the singular. 
 10.18 Notice . Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to the Plan Administrator under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand delivered, or sent by registered or certified mail, to TE Connectivity Corporation, Attn: Employee Benefits Administrative Committee, c/o TE Law Department, 1050 Westlakes Drive, Berwyn, PA 19312-2423 or to such other person or entity as the Plan Administrator may designate from time to time. Such notice shall be deemed given as of the date of delivery, or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark on the receipt for registration or certification. 
 10.19 Amendment and Termination . The Plan may be amended, suspended, or terminated at any time by the Company in whole or in part in its sole discretion; provided, however, that no such amendment, suspension or termination shall result in any reduction in the value of a Participant s Account determined as of the effective date of such amendment. In addition, the Plan, and/or the terms of any election made hereunder, may be amended at any time and in any respect by the Company or by the Plan Administrator if and to the extent recommended by counsel in order to conform to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and regulations thereunder or to any other Section of the Code or regulation that bears on the tax-deferred character of the benefits provided hereunder or to maintain the tax-qualified status of the RSIP. In the event of any suspension or termination of the Plan or any portion thereof, payment of affected Participants Accounts shall be made under and in accordance with the terms of the Plan and the applicable elections (except that the Plan Administrator may determine, in its sole discretion, to accelerate payments to all such Participants if and to the extent that such acceleration is permitted under Section 409A of the Code and regulations thereunder). 

 23 

10.20 Delay of Payment for Specified Employees . Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, in the case of any Participant who is a specified employee as of the date of such Participant s Separation from Service within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, no Separation Payments under this Plan may be made, or may commence, before the date which is six months after such Participant s Separation from Service Date (or, if earlier, the date of the Participant s death). 
 10.21 Special Rule Regarding Election Changes on or Before December 31, 2008 . To the extent permitted under the provisions of Internal Revenue Service Notice 2005-1, A-19(c) and subsequent related guidance, the Company may, in its sole discretion, permit a Participant to modify an existing election with respect to the timing and form of payment of the Participant s Account hereunder, including, in the Company s discretion, amounts deferred under the Tyco Deferred Compensation Plan that were vested as of December 31, 2004 and would otherwise not be subject to the provisions of this Plan, without regard to the limitations set forth in Section 8.2, so long as (i) such modification is made on or before December 31, 2008, (ii) such modified election is consistent with the provisions of Sections 8.1 and 10.19 hereof, and (iii) the modified election is made in a year prior to the year in which payment would have been made hereunder but for such election. Participants who are offered such an election for amounts deferred under this Plan (or under a predecessor plan) prior to the Restated Effective Date and who decline to make such an election shall thereafter have that portion of their Account attributable to such deferrals governed by the provisions of this Plan as in effect as of the Restated Effective Date and any previous elections applicable thereto (except to the extent otherwise required in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code).

If for any reason, such as imprecision in drafting, any provision of this Agreement (or of any award of compensation, including, without limitation, equity compensation or benefits) does not accurately reflect its intended establishment of an exemption from (or compliance with) Code Section 409A, as demonstrated by consistent interpretations or other evidence of intent, such provision shall be considered ambiguous as to its exemption from (or compliance with) Code Section 409A and shall be interpreted by the Company in a manner consistent with such intent, as determined in the discretion of the Company. (b) A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits that are considered nonqualified deferred compensation under Code Section 409A upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a separation from service within the meaning of Code Section 409A, and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a termination, termination of employment or like terms shall mean such a separation from service. The determination of whether and when a separation from service has occurred for purposes of this Agreement shall be made in accordance with the presumptions set forth in Section 1.409A-1(h) of the Treasury Regulations.

(c) Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if at the time of the Executive s separation from service, the Company determines that the Executive is a specified employee, within the meaning of Code Section 409A, then to the extent any payment or benefit that the Executive becomes entitled to under this Agreement on account of such separation from service would be considered nonqualified deferred compensation under Code Section 409A, such payment or benefit shall be paid or provided at the date which is the earlier of (i) six (6) months and one day after such separation from service, and (ii) the date of the Executive s death (the Delay Period ). Upon the expiration of the Delay Period, all payments and benefits delayed pursuant to this Section 9(c) (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) shall be paid or provided to the Executive in a lump-sum with interest at the prime rate as published by The Wall Street Journal on the first business day of the Delay Period, and any remaining payments and benefits due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein. (d) Any reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement that constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Code Section 409A shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 409A, including, without limitation, that (i) in no event shall any fees, expenses or other amounts eligible to be reimbursed by the Company under this Agreement be paid later than the last day of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which the applicable fees, expenses or other amounts were incurred; (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits that the Company is obligated to pay or provide, in any given calendar year shall not affect the expenses that the Company is obligated to reimburse, or the in-kind benefits that the Company is obligated to pay or provide, in any other calendar year, provided that the foregoing clause (ii) shall not be violated with regard to expenses reimbursed under any arrangement covered by Code Section 105(b) solely because such expenses are subject to a limit related to the period the arrangement is in effect; (iii) the Executive s right to have the Company pay or provide such reimbursements and in-kind benefits may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit; and (iv) in no event shall the Company s obligations to make such reimbursements or to provide such in-kind benefits apply later than the Executive s remaining lifetime (or if longer, through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Commencement Date). (e) For purposes of Code Section 409A, the Executive s right to receive any installment payments shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments. Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days (for example, payment shall be made within thirty (30) days following the date of termination ), the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Company. In no event may the Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of any payment to be made under this Agreement, to the extent such payment is subject to Code Section 409A. (f) The Company makes no representation or warranty and shall have no liability to the Executive or any other person if any provisions of this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A but do not satisfy an exemption from, or the conditions of, Code Section 409A.

If the Executive s employment is terminated for the reasons described in Sections 7(a)(i) or 7(a)(ii), the Company shall provide the Executive with cash consideration in exchange for the Executive s execution, and compliance with the terms, of the restrictive covenants and release of claims set forth in the separation agreement described in Section 7(c).

Such consideration shall be payable in equal installments over a twelve month period following the date of such termination in accordance with the Company s payroll practices, subject to reduction for any applicable tax withholding and/or pursuant to any terms of the separation agreement described in Section 7(c). (c) Separation Agreement and Release of Claims .

If such a general release described in clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence has not been executed and delivered and become irrevocable on or before 
 5 

the end of such thirty (30)-day period, no amounts or benefits under Section 7(b) shall be or become payable.

The Executive acknowledges and agrees that, except as specifically described in this Section 7, all of the Executive s rights to any compensation, benefits, bonuses or other payments from the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates after termination of the Employment Term shall cease upon such termination. (e) Offset . To the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), any consideration to which the Executive is otherwise entitled pursuant to this Section 7 shall be (i) reduced by amounts outstanding under any indebtedness, obligations or liabilities owed by the Executive to the Company; (ii) reduced and offset by any severance pay or benefits, or similar amounts, payable to the Executive due to his termination of employment under any labor, social or other governmental plan, program, law or policy, and should such other payments or benefits described in this clause be payable, payments under this Agreement shall be reduced accordingly or, alternatively, payments previously paid or provided under this Agreement will be treated as having been paid or provided to satisfy such other obligations. (f) Resignation as Officer or Director . Upon a termination of employment, unless requested otherwise by the Company, the Executive shall resign each position (if any) that the Executive then holds as a director or officer of the Company or of any affiliates of the Company. The Executive s execution of this Agreement shall be deemed the grant by the Executive to the officers of the Company of a limited power of attorney to sign in the Executive s name and on the Executive s behalf any such documentation as may be required to be executed solely for the limited purposes of effectuating such resignations. (g) Definitions of Certain Terms . For purposes of this Agreement: (i) Cause shall have the meaning given that term in the Company s Severance Plan for U.S. Officers and Executives, as such plan may be amended from time to time.

Section 409A.

If for any reason, such as imprecision in drafting, any provision of this Agreement (or of any award of compensation, including, without limitation, equity compensation or benefits) does not accurately reflect its intended establishment of an exemption from (or compliance with) Code Section 409A, as demonstrated by consistent interpretations or other evidence of intent, such provision shall be considered ambiguous as to its exemption from (or compliance with) Code Section 409A and shall be interpreted by the Company in a manner consistent with such intent, as determined in the discretion of the Company. (b) A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits that are considered nonqualified deferred compensation under Code Section 409A upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a separation from service within the meaning of Code Section 409A, and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a termination, termination of employment or like terms shall mean such a separation from service. The determination of whether and when a separation from service has occurred for purposes of this Agreement shall be made in accordance with the presumptions set forth in Section 1.409A-1(h) of the Treasury Regulations. 
 7 

(c) Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if at the time of the Executive s separation from service, the Company determines that the Executive is a specified employee, within the meaning of Code Section 409A, then to the extent any payment or benefit that the Executive becomes entitled to under this Agreement on account of such separation from service would be considered nonqualified deferred compensation under Code Section 409A, such payment or benefit shall be paid or provided at the date which is the earlier of (i) six (6) months and one day after such separation from service, and (ii) the date of the Executive s death (the Delay Period ). Upon the expiration of the Delay Period, all payments and benefits delayed pursuant to this Section 9(c) (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) shall be paid or provided to the Executive in a lump-sum with interest at the prime rate as published by The Wall Street Journal on the first business day of the Delay Period, and any remaining payments and benefits due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein. (d) Any reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement that constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Code Section 409A shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 409A, including, without limitation, that (i) in no event shall any fees, expenses or other amounts eligible to be reimbursed by the Company under this Agreement be paid later than the last day of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which the applicable fees, expenses or other amounts were incurred; (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits that the Company is obligated to pay or provide, in any given calendar year shall not affect the expenses that the Company is obligated to reimburse, or the in-kind benefits that the Company is obligated to pay or provide, in any other calendar year, provided that the foregoing clause (ii) shall not be violated with regard to expenses reimbursed under any arrangement covered by Code Section 105(b) solely because such expenses are subject to a limit related to the period the arrangement is in effect; (iii) the Executive s right to have the Company pay or provide such reimbursements and in-kind benefits may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit; and (iv) in no event shall the Company s obligations to make such reimbursements or to provide such in-kind benefits apply later than the Executive s remaining lifetime (or if longer, through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Commencement Date). (e) For purposes of Code Section 409A, the Executive s right to receive any installment payments shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments. Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days (for example, payment shall be made within thirty (30) days following the date of termination ), the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Company. In no event may the Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of any payment to be made under this Agreement, to the extent such payment is subject to Code Section 409A. (f) The Company makes no representation or warranty and shall have no liability to the Executive or any other person if any provisions of this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A but do not satisfy an exemption from, or the conditions of, Code Section 409A.

If the Executive s employment is terminated for the reasons described in Sections 7(a)(i) or 7(a)(ii), the Company shall provide the Executive with cash consideration in exchange for the Executive s execution, and compliance with the terms, of the restrictive covenants and release of claims set forth in the separation agreement described in Section 7(c).

or other payments from the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates after termination of the Employment Term shall cease upon such termination. (e) Offset . To the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), any consideration to which the Executive is otherwise entitled pursuant to this Section 7 shall be (i) reduced by amounts outstanding under any indebtedness, obligations or liabilities owed by the Executive to the Company; (ii) reduced and offset by any severance pay or benefits, or similar amounts, payable to the Executive due to his termination of employment under any labor, social or other governmental plan, program, law or policy, and s hould such other payments or benefits described in this clause be payable, payments under this Agreement shall be reduced accordingly or, alternatively, payments previously paid or provided under this Agreement will be treated as having been paid or provided to satisfy such other obligations .

Upon a termination of employment, unless requested otherwise by the Company, the Executive shall resign each position (if any) that the Executive then holds as a director or officer of the Company or of any affiliates of the Company. The Executive s execution of this Agreement shall be deemed the grant by the Executive to the officers of the Company of a limited power of attorney to sign in the Executive s name and on the Executive s behalf any such documentation as may be required to be executed solely for the limited purposes of effectuating such resignations. (g) Definitions of Certain Terms . For purposes of this Agreement: 1 (i) Cause shall have the meaning given that term in the Company s Severance Plan for U.S. Officers and Executives, as such plan may be amended from time to time.

Section 409A. (a) The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with or be exempt from Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder (collectively Code Section 409A ), and the Company shall have complete discretion to interpret and construe this Agreement and any associated documents in any manner that establishes an exemption from (or compliance with) the requirements of Code Section 409A. If for any reason, such as imprecision in drafting, any provision of this Agreement (or of any award of compensation, including, without limitation, equity compensation or benefits) does not accurately reflect its intended establishment of an exemption from (or compliance with) Code Section 409A, as demonstrated by consistent interpretations or other evidence of intent, such provision shall be considered ambiguous as to its exemption from (or compliance with) Code Section 409A and shall be interpreted by the Company in a manner consistent with such intent, as determined in the discretion of the Company. 
 (b) A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits that are considered nonqualified deferred compensation under Code Section 409A upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a separation from service within the meaning of Code Section 409A, and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a termination, termination of employment or like terms shall mean such a separation from service. The determination of whether and when a separation from service has occurred for purposes of this Agreement shall be made in accordance with the presumptions set forth in Section 1.409A-1(h) of the Treasury Regulations.
 (c) Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if at the time of the Executive s separation from service, the Company determines that the Executive is a specified employee, within the meaning of Code Section 409A, then to the extent any payment or benefit that the Executive becomes entitled to under this Agreement on account of such separation from service would be considered nonqualified deferred compensation under Code Section 409A, such payment or benefit shall 

 7 

be paid or provided at the date which is the earlier of (i) six (6) months and one day after such separation from service, and (ii) the date of the Executive s death (the Delay Period ). Upon the expiration of the Delay Period, all payments and benefits delayed pursuant to this Section 9(c) (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such delay) shall be paid or provided to the Executive in a lump-sum with interest at the prime rate as published by The Wall Street Journal on the first business day of the Delay Period, and any remaining payments and benefits due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein.
 (d) Any reimbursements and in-kind benefits provided under this Agreement that constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Code Section 409A shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 409A, including, without limitation, that (i) in no event shall any fees, expenses or other amounts eligible to be reimbursed by the Company under this Agreement be paid later than the last day of the calendar year next following the calendar year in which the applicable fees, expenses or other amounts were incurred; (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits that the Company is obligated to pay or provide, in any given calendar year shall not affect the expenses that the Company is obligated to reimburse, or the in-kind benefits that the Company is obligated to pay or provide, in any other calendar year, provided that the foregoing clause (ii) shall not be violated with regard to expenses reimbursed under any arrangement covered by Code Section 105(b) solely because such expenses are subject to a limit related to the period the arrangement is in effect; (iii) the Executive s right to have the Company pay or provide such reimbursements and in-kind benefits may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit; and (iv) in no event shall the Company s obligations to make such reimbursements or to provide such in-kind benefits apply later than the Executive s remaining lifetime (or if longer, through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Commencement Date).
 (e) For purposes of Code Section 409A, the Executive s right to receive any installment payments shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments. Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days (for example, payment shall be made within thirty (30) days following the date of termination ), the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Company. In no event may the Executive, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of any payment to be made under this Agreement, to the extent such payment is subject to Code Section 409A. 
 (f) The Company makes no representation or warranty and shall have no liability to the Executive or any other person if any provisions of this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A but do not satisfy an exemption from, or the conditions of, Code Section 409A.
 10. Say on Pay Limitations. (a) Say on Pay Requirements. Under Swiss say and pay law, the maximum aggregate amount of compensation of the executive management must be approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders of TE Connectivity Ltd. (the GM as a public Swiss company. At each GM, the Company presents to the Company s shareholders for approval the maximum aggregate amount of compensation that can be paid to the executive management in the next succeeding fiscal year. If the GM does not approve the maximum aggregate amount of compensation of the executive management, the Company will determine whether and to what extent the Executive s compensation in that fiscal year will be affected. If the Executive s compensation is affected, this 2015 Agreement continues to be effective subject to paragraph (b) below.

 8 

(b) Non-Approval by GM. If the GM refuses to approve the proposed maximum aggregate compensation of the executive management, and Executive s compensation is subject to the approval of the GM, the Executive by signing this 2015 Agreement (i) agrees to accept a modification - as determined by the Company - of the compensation and benefits under this 2015 Agreement, and (ii) if the Company decides to pay compensation on a provisional basis in view of what a following GM may approve, the Executive will have to repay any amount of compensation received but subsequently not approved by any following GM.

Exhibit 97.1 TE Connectivity Ltd. Incentive-Based Compensation Recovery Policy The Board of Directors (the Board of TE Connectivity Ltd. (the Company has adopted this policy (the Policy to provide for the recovery of erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation received by certain current and former executive officers who received such compensation during the three fiscal years preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws as specified in this Policy. This Policy supplements any requirements imposed pursuant to applicable law or regulations, any clawback or recoupment provision in the Company s other recoupment policies, plans, awards and individual employment or other agreements, and any other rights or remedies available to the Company, including termination of employment. If such other policy provides that a greater amount of such compensation shall be subject to clawback, such other policy shall apply to the amount in excess of the amount subject to clawback under this policy. This Policy is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 303A.14 of the Listed Company Manual of the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE ). Administration: The Board or the Management Development and Compensation Committee (the Compensation Committee ), if delegated to it by the Board, will administer and interpret this Policy and make all determination for the administration of this Policy. Any determinations made by the Board or the Compensation Committee, if delegated to it by the Board, will be final, binding and conclusive on all affected individuals. Statement of Policy: Following the occurrence of a Recoupment Trigger (as defined below), the Company will recover reasonably promptly the Erroneously Awarded Compensation (as defined below) from the applicable Covered Individual(s) (as defined below), except as provided in this Policy. Covered Individuals Subject to the Recovery Policy: The Policy is applicable to any current or former executive officer as defined by Section 303A.14 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, who has received the subject Incentive-Based Compensation, after beginning service as an executive officer and who served as an executive officer at any time during the performance period covered by the Recoupment Period (together, Covered Individuals ). Recoupment Trigger for Accounting Restatements: A Recoupment Trigger will have occurred upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the date the Board, the Audit Committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement; or (ii) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement. For the purposes of this Policy, an Accounting Restatement means a restatement of the Company s financial statements due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement (i) to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or (ii) that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company s obligation to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not dependent on if or when the restated financial statements are presented within the financial statements or filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Recoupment Period: The Policy will apply to Incentive-Based Compensation received during or the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which a Recoupment Trigger occurs (the Recoupment Period ). In addition to these last three completed fiscal years, this Policy applies to any transition period (that results from a change in the Company s fiscal year) within or immediately following such three completed fiscal 
 1 

years. However, a transition period between the last day of the Company s previous fiscal year end and the first day of its new fiscal year that comprises a period of nine to 12 months would be deemed a completed fiscal year. Compensation Received . Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed to have been received by a Covered Individual in the fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the applicable award occurs after the end of that period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the only compensation subject to this Policy is Incentive-Based Compensation received by Covered Individuals on or after October 2, 2023 and while the Company had a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association. Incentive-Based Compensation Subject to Recoupment. Any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure Incentive-Based Compensation will be subject to this Policy. A Financial Reporting Measure is a measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures. Stock price and total shareholder return are also Financial Reporting Measures. A Financial Reporting Measure need not be presented within the financial statements or included in a filing with the SEC. Erroneously Awarded Compensation. In the event of a Recoupment Trigger, the Board or the Compensation Committee, if delegated to by the Board, will seek to recover from any applicable Covered Individual an amount of Incentive-Based Compensation received that exceeds the amount that otherwise would have been received by such Covered Individual had it been determined based on the restated amounts, computed without regard to any taxes paid (the Erroneously Awarded Compensation ). For Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an Accounting Restatement, (A) the amount must be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was received and (B) the Company will maintain documentation of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the NYSE. Limited Exceptions. The Company must recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation in compliance with this Policy, except to the extent that the conditions of paragraphs (c)(1)(iv)(A), (B) or (C) of NYSE Rule 303A.14, are met and the Compensation Committee, or a majority of the independent directors serving on the Board, has made a determination that recovery would be impracticable. Method of Recoupment: The Board or the Compensation Committee, if delegated to by the Board, will determine in its sole discretion how the Company will effect any reimbursement or recovery pursuant to this Policy, including, but not limited to the following: (1) seeking repayment from the Covered Individual; (2) reducing (subject to applicable law and the terms and conditions of the applicable plan, program or arrangement) the amount that would otherwise be payable to the Covered Individual under any compensation, bonus, incentive, equity and other benefit plan, agreement, policy or arrangement maintained by the Company or any of its affiliates; (3) canceling any outstanding vested or unvested or unpaid award (whether cash- or equity-based) previously granted to the Covered Individual; (4) withholding payment of future increases in compensation (including payment of any permissible discretionary bonus payments or amounts) or grants of compensatory or equity awards that otherwise would have been made in accordance with the Company s applicable compensation practices or decisions; or (5) any combination of the foregoing. No Fault. Incentive-Based Compensation is subject to recoupment under this Policy even if the Accounting Restatement was not due to any misconduct or failure of oversight on the part a Covered Individual. Amendment or Termination of Policy: The Board or the Compensation Committee, if delegated to by the Board, may alter or amend the Policy at any time, including to incorporate any obligations of recoupment under applicable law. 
 2 

Indemnification. The Company is prohibited from indemnifying any Covered Individual against the loss of Erroneously Awarded Compensation. Validity and Enforceability. To the extent that any provision of this Policy is found to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such provision will be applied to the maximum extent permitted, and shall automatically be deemed amended in a manner consistent with its objectives to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Policy shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Policy. This Policy is intended to comply with, shall be interpreted to comply with, and shall be deemed automatically amended to comply with Section 303A.14 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, and any related rules or regulations promulgated by the SEC or NYSE including any additional or new requirements that become effective after October 2, 2023. Adopted by the Board of Directors on October 2, 2023
