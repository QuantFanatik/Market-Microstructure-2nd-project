 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 
 Overview 
 Helmerich Payne, Inc. ("H P," which, together with its subsidiaries, is identified as the Company, we, us or our, except where stated or the context requires otherwise) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on February 3, 1940 and is successor to a business originally organized in 1920. We provide performance-driven drilling solutions and technologies that are intended to make hydrocarbon recovery safer and more economical for oil and gas exploration and production companies. We are an important partner for a number of oil and gas exploration and production companies, but we focus primarily on the drilling segment of the oil and gas production value chain. Our technology services focus on developing, promoting and commercializing technologies designed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of drilling operations, as well as wellbore quality and placement. 
 Our drilling services operations are organized into the following reportable operating business segments: North America Solutions, Offshore Gulf of Mexico and International Solutions. Our North America Solutions operations are primarily located in Texas, but also traditionally operate in other states, depending on demand. Such states include: Colorado, Louisiana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming. Additionally, Offshore Gulf of Mexico operations are conducted in Louisiana and in U.S. federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico and our International Solutions operations have rigs and/or services primarily located in five international locations: Argentina, Bahrain, Colombia, the United Arab Emirates ("U.A.E."), and Australia. Our operations in Australia commenced in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2023. 
 We also own and operate a limited number of commercial real estate properties located in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Our real estate investments include a shopping center containing approximately 365,000 leasable square feet and approximately 176 acres of undeveloped real estate. Our research and development endeavors include both internal development and external acquisition of developing technologies. Our wholly-owned captive insurance companies (the Captives are primarily used to insure the deductibles for our workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability, rig property and a medical stop-loss program. The Company and the Captives maintain excess property and casualty reinsurance programs with third-party insurers in an effort to limit the financial impact of significant events covered under these programs. Our real estate operations, our incubator program for new research and development projects, and our wholly-owned captive insurance companies are included in "Other."

 Bahrain As of September 30, 2023, we had three available rigs in Bahrain. Revenues generated by Bahrain drilling operations contributed approximately 0.5 percent 15.4 million) of our consolidated operating revenues in fiscal year 2023, compared to approximately 0.8 percent 17.0 million) and 2.3 percent 27.4 million) of our consolidated operating revenues during fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. All of our revenues in Bahrain are from a partner of the local national oil company. 
 United Arab Emirates During the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, our operations in U.A.E. consisted of services provided to ADNOC Drilling Company P.J.S.C. ("ADNOC Drilling"), primarily in the form of secondment labor, as part of the strategic alliance that was announced in September 2021. H P's alliance with ADNOC Drilling includes several accretive projects, in addition to general consulting services, that leverage H P's expertise and technologies to help deliver more competitive well completion times, greater drilling efficiencies, and improved well economics. As of September 30, 2023, we had one available rig in the U.A.E. 
 Australia During the year ended September 30, 2023, we commenced drilling operations in Australia. All of our revenue in Australia is from one customer Tamboran, a publicly traded company. As of September 30, 2023, we had one available rig in Australia. 
 Other Operations 
 We own and operate a limited number of commercial real estate properties located in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Our real estate investments include a shopping center and undeveloped real estate. 
 We continue to use our captive insurance subsidiaries ("the Captives") to insure the deductibles for our domestic workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability claims programs, and medical stop-loss program and to insure the deductibles from the Company's international casualty and rig property programs. 
 The Company's incubator program includes activity related to investments in emerging technology companies. 
 Our real estate operations, our incubator program, and our wholly-owned captive insurance companies are included in "Other" within our segment disclosures. 
 Rigs, Equipment, R D, and Facilities 
 During the late 1990 s, we undertook a strategic initiative to develop a new generation drilling rig that would be the safest, fastest-moving and highest performing rig in the land drilling market. Our first FlexRig drilling rig entered the market in 1998. We continued to innovate and in 2002 introduced our first AC drive rigs, which incorporated new drilling technology and improved safety and environmental design. These rigs found immediate success by delivering higher value wells to the customer and marked the beginning of the AC land rig revolution.

 We also changed our pricing and contracting strategy, and beginning in 2005, predominantly all new FlexRig drilling rigs were built, supported by a firm contract, and generated attractive returns. To date, we have built over 200 FlexRig rigs that align with this strategy. An important part of our strategy was to design a rig that could support continuous improvement through upgrade capability of the hardware and software on the rigs to take advantage of technology improvements and lengthening the industry rig replacement cycle. These upgrades included, but were not limited to, enhanced drilling control systems and software, skid and walking systems for drilling multiple well pads, 7,500 psi mud systems, set back capacity to accommodate the pipe that the longer laterals demanded, and additional mud system capacity. 
 In 2011, we introduced a FlexRig design for long lateral drilling of multiple wells from a single location and for drilling horizontally in unconventional shale reservoirs. The new design preserved the key performance features of earlier designs but added a bi-directional skidding system and equipment capacities suitable for drilling long lateral wells. 
 In 2016, we saw the further progression of longer lateral wells, which brought additional technical challenges. At that time, we began delivering rigs to the market that were equipped and capable of drilling these longer lateral wells. The industry would later refer to these rigs as super-spec rigs, which have the following specific characteristics: AC drive, minimum 1,500 horsepower drawworks, minimum of 750,000 lbs. hookload rating, 7,500 psi mud circulating system, and multiple-well pad capability. Additionally, our competency in design and construction as well as our financial strength enabled us to efficiently upgrade our other existing rigs to super-spec, resulting in what we believe to be the largest fleet of super-spec rigs in the world. As a result of these investments, today the vast majority of our current domestic fleet is comprised of super-spec rigs and half the rigs in our international fleet are super-spec rigs. As of September 30, 2023, we had a total of 242 super-spec rigs. 
 In 2017, we introduced our first walking rig by reconfiguring some of our uni-directional skid designed FlexRig drilling rigs. Since then, we have reconfigured, converted, and upgraded a total of 68 FlexRig drilling rigs to super-spec walking rigs. 
 Years of designing and building our fleet of AC drive FlexRig drilling rigs has given us many competitive benefits. One key advantage is fleet uniformity. We have overseen the design and assembly of all of our AC FlexRig drilling rigs, and our different rig classes share many common components. We co-designed the control systems for our rigs and have the right to make any changes or modifications to those systems that we desire. A uniform fleet creates an adaptive environment to reach maximum efficiency for employees, equipment and technology and is critical to our ability to provide consistent, safe and reliable operations in increasingly complex basins. In addition, our fleet has greater scale than any other competitor, which enables us to upgrade our existing FlexRig drilling rigs to super-spec in a capital efficient way. High levels of uniformity in crew training and rotation and our ability to identify and remove safety exposures across a more standard fleet allow us to deliver higher performance in a safer and more reliable manner for the customer. Further, our fleet is supported by a cost-effective Company-owned supply chain that provides standardized materials directly to the rigs from our regional warehouses. 
 A long-standing challenge in our industry is providing high quality and consistent results. In addressing this challenge, we utilize process excellence techniques that are developed internally. We provide experienced drilling and maintenance support for our operations, which provides value by reducing nonproductive time in our operations and improving drilling performance through our Rig Systems Monitoring and Support Center RSMS and Remote Operations Centers ("ROCs"). Our RSMS and ROCs are manned 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with the ability to monitor and detect trends in drilling and drilling services performance onboard our rigs. Our monitoring group within the RSMS provides real-time help and feedback to our wellsite employees, as well as our customers, to fully optimize our operational performance. Additionally, our RSMS and ROCs have staffs of engineers and industry experts that work with our customers to enhance wellbore positioning, drilling program execution and overall drilling performance. The monitoring group and our performance engineers capture our drilling work steps to help provide high quality and reliable results for our customers. 
 We currently have two facilities that provide vertically integrated solutions for drilling rig manufacturing, upgrades, retrofits and modifications, as well as overhauling, recertification, and repairs as it relates to our rigs and equipment. These facilities utilize lean manufacturing processes to enhance quality and efficiency as well as provide important insights into the maintenance and wear of equipment on our rigs. Our facility located in Galena Park, Texas is primarily utilized for overall rig assembly, overhaul, recommissioning and recertification while our facility near Tulsa, Oklahoma is primarily utilized for modular rig component overhauls and repairs. 
 We continue to see adoption and growth with our technologically enabled automation solutions. We designed our automation solutions to address challenges within our customers businesses as much of the drilling process is heavily dependent on human decision-making to design, execute and optimize crude oil and natural gas extraction. Utilizing these technologies, we are able to deploy a more data-driven solution compared to human decisions and execution, thereby reducing variability and the costs around achieving optimal outcomes. These solutions are designed to continue to help provide differentiated value for our customers through enhanced wellbore quality and placement, improved cost performance and well economics, and better consistency at reduced risk. Our automation-focused solutions and applications are enabled by our uniform digital fleet and are designed to provide additional value to our customers' well programs by providing a platform for machine-human collaboration during the drilling process to improve efficiency. Our path to autonomous drilling continues to evolve with several solutions in various stages of commercial testing. All of our technologies play an important role in developing our strategy as we head towards autonomous drilling.

 We have historically offered ancillary services, which are now referred to as FlexServices . Currently, these services include surface equipment rental, pipe rental and additional rig crew. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we sold the assets associated with two lower margin service offerings, trucking and casing running services, which contributed approximately 2.8 percent to our consolidated revenues during fiscal year 2021, in two separate transactions. The sale of our trucking services assets was completed on November 3, 2021, while the sale of our casing running services assets was completed on November 15, 2021, for total consideration less costs to sell of 6.0 million, in addition to the possibility of future earnout proceeds, resulting in a loss of 3.4 million. We recognized earnout proceeds associated with the sale of our trucking and casing running assets of 1.6 million and 1.1 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, within Other (gain) loss on sale of assets on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Markets and Competition 
 Our business largely depends on the level of capital spending by oil and gas companies for exploration and production activities. The level of capital spending has traditionally been correlated to oil and gas prices. Oil and gas prices can be volatile at times depending upon both near and long-term supply and demand factors. Sustained increases or decreases in the prices of oil and natural gas generally have a material impact on the exploration and production activities of our customers. As such, significant declines in the prices of oil and natural gas may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As of September 30, 2023, we had 164 active rigs under contract, compared to 192 and 137 rigs under contract as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For further information concerning risks associated with our business, including volatility surrounding oil and natural gas prices and the impact of low oil prices on our business, see Item 1A Risk Factors and Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Form 10 K. 
 Our industry is highly competitive, and we strive to differentiate our services based upon the quality of our FlexRig drilling rigs and our engineering design expertise, operational efficiency, software technologies, and safety and environmental awareness. The number of available rigs generally exceeds demand in many of our markets, resulting in significant price competition. We compete against many drilling companies, some of whom are present in more than one of our operating regions. In the United States, we compete with Nabors Industries Ltd., Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc., Precision Drilling Corporation, and many other competitors with regional operations. Internationally, we compete directly with various contractors at each location where we operate. In the Gulf of Mexico platform rig market, we primarily compete with Nabors Industries Ltd. and Blake International Rigs, LLC. For further information concerning risks associated with competition in our industry, see Item 1A Risk Factors Business and Operating Risks. 
 Drilling Contracts 
 Our drilling contracts are obtained through competitive bidding or as a result of direct negotiations with customers. Our contracts vary in their terms and rates depending on the nature of the operations to be performed, the duration of the work, the amount and type of equipment and services provided, the geographic areas involved, market conditions and other variables. In many instances, our contracts cover multi well or pad and multi year projects. Contracts generally contain renewal or extension provisions exercisable at the option of the customer at prices mutually agreeable to us and the customer. In most instances, contracts provide for additional payments for mobilization and demobilization of the rig. 
 The duration of our drilling contracts are generally either well to well/pad-to-pad or for a fixed term. Well to well contracts can be terminated at the option of either party upon the completion of drilling of any one well. Fixed-term contracts generally have a minimum term of at least six months up to multiple years. These contracts customarily provide for termination at the election of the customer, but may include an early termination payment to be paid to us if the contract is terminated prior to the expiration of the fixed term. However, under certain limited circumstances such as destruction of a drilling rig, bankruptcy, sustained unacceptable performance by us or delivery of a rig beyond certain grace and/or liquidated damage periods, no early termination payment would be paid to us. 
 Each drilling rig operates under a separate drilling contract and, in some instances, these contracts are part of an over-arching term agreement known as a FlexPool. These agreements are with a limited number of customers that operate multiple rigs, oftentimes across multiple basins in the U.S. Under the FlexPool agreements, customers enter into a fixed term contract covering a minimum amount of drilling days, utilizing a minimum number of drilling rigs and have the flexibility to employ more or fewer rigs as long as the minimum number of rigs (outlined in the agreement) is maintained. If any provisions are violated, as in a customer operating below the minimum number of rigs, early termination payments may apply. 
 Daywork Contracts 
 Daywork contracts are contracts under which we charge a rate per day, with the price determined by the location, depth and complexity of the well to be drilled, operating conditions, the duration of the contract, and the competitive forces of the market. During fiscal year 2023, a majority of our drilling services were performed on a daywork contract basis.

 Performance-based Contracts 
 Performance-based contracts are contracts pursuant to which we are compensated partly based upon our performance against a mutually agreed upon set of predetermined targets. These contract types are relatively new to the industry and typically have a lower base dayrate, but give us the opportunity to receive additional compensation by meeting or exceeding certain performance targets agreed to by our customers. For example, some performance targets are set based upon days to drill a well or the number of lateral feet drilled in zone per day. We often use our automated technology solutions to assist in achieving the performance targets. The risks associated with these contracts relate to the failure to reach the agreed upon performance targets. If we do not meet these targets, we will not receive additional compensation above the base dayrate. Based on our operational track record throughout fiscal year 2023 and drilling expertise, our performance-based contracts have produced a positive risk-reward outcome. We are seeing a growing adoption of performance contracts by our customers and we expect this trend to continue. Refer to Note 9 Revenue from Contracts with Customers for additional information related to performance-based contracts. 
 Contract Backlog 
 As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, our drilling contract backlog was 1.4 billion and 1.2 billion, respectively. Approximately 33.8 percent of the September 30, 2023 backlog is reasonably expected to be fulfilled in fiscal year 2025 and thereafter. See Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contract Backlog" included in this Form 10-K for additional information pertaining to backlog. 
 Employees 
 As of September 30, 2023, we had approximately 6,200 employees within the United States and approximately 900 employees in our international operations. The number of employees fluctuates depending on the current and expected demand for our services. We consider our employee relations to be robust. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a union. However, some of our international employees are unionized. 
 Human Capital Objectives and Programs 
 We strive to create a culture and work environment that enables us to attract, train, promote, and retain a diverse group of talented employees who together can help us gain a competitive advantage. 
 Core Values and Culture 
 "The H P Way" defines our purpose, core values, and the behaviors that drive our culture. What we endeavor to do is anchored in our purpose, improving lives through efficient and responsible energy. Fostering and maintaining a strong, healthy culture is a key strategic focus. Our core values serve to inform who we are and the way our employees interact with one another, our customers, partners and shareholders. Our core value of Actively C.A.R.E. means that we treat one another with respect. We care about each other, and from a safety perspective, our employees are committed to Controlling and Removing Exposures ("C.A.R.E.") for themselves and others. Our core value of Service Attitude means that we do our part and more for those around us. We consider the needs of others and provide solutions to meet their needs. Our core value of Innovative Spirit means that we constantly work to improve and are willing to try new approaches. We make decisions with the long-term view in mind. Our core value of Teamwork means that we listen to one another and work across teams toward a common goal. We collaborate to achieve results and focus on success for our customers and shareholders. Finally, we strive to Do The Right Thing. That means we are honest and transparent. We tackle tough situations, make decisions, and speak up when needed. 
 Talent Attraction Retention 
 Our recruiting practices and decisions on whom we hire are among our most important activities. Our Workforce Staffing team provides full staffing services to enable consistent staffing levels on our rigs. This team sources, hires, onboards, trains, assigns and reassigns rig-based employees. In downturn years, we maintain relationships with former employees and prioritize recalling our most experienced people for field positions. In addition, we utilize social media, local job fairs, employee referral bonuses, and educational organizations across the United States to find diverse, motivated and responsible employees.

 Education and Training 
 We are committed to the continual training and development of our employees, especially of those in field operations, to help ensure we can develop future managers and leaders from within our organization. Our training starts with on-boarding procedures that focus on safety, responsibility, ethical conduct and inclusive teamwork. 
 H P s strong commitment to our employees growth is demonstrated through our formal organizational development team, which oversees talent management, training and development. In addition to career and safety training efforts, the team creates, manages and implements enhancements to development and succession plans, change management initiatives and diversity, equity and inclusion ("DE I") programs. 
 H P offers a variety of training programs ranging from job specific programs to leadership development. Some of the prominent training programs that we offer are: 
 New Employment Safety Training - onboarding program for new hires in safety sensitive positions. The purpose of the program is to prepare employees to work safely on our rigs and provide necessary certifications to do so; including all Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") and International Association of Drilling Contractors ("IADC") training, as well as Company culture education. 
 Short Service Employee Training - specialized training program that is a continuation of New Employment Introduction basics and is intended to provide technical on-the-job training guided by a mentor. 
 Ethics and Compliance Training comprised of several specific training programs, including Code of Conduct, Insider Trading, Anti-Discrimination Harassment, Data Privacy, Trade Compliance, and Anti-Corruption. 
 Change Champions Training - teaches employees to solve complex problems using structured processes, tools and data to drive results while emphasizing leadership and public speaking. 
 Leadership Series Training - accessible online to all leaders and covers a variety of topics related to leading The H P Way. 
 Safety Training and Serious Injury and/or Fatality ("SIF") Reduction Program 
 We are committed to creating a culture highlighted by an Actively Caring workforce. We strive to Actively C.A.R.E. for: 
 our own safety and health; 
 the safety and health of others; and 
 the protection of our environment. 
 Fundamental to our Actively C.A.R.E. culture is every individual's willingness to provide immediate open feedback to others regarding safe and unsafe work practices and to proactively correct recognized exposures that threaten one's health and safety. Through training and accountability, H P educates our employees on the negative consequences of taking health and safety risks. 
 Safety Leadership 
 For more than 20 years, H P measured safety success the same way other companies in our industry did the absence of OSHA recordable injuries and declining total recordable injury rates ("TRIR"). We now believe it is more important to take a more holistic and proactive approach to identify safety issues which supports management's efforts to build trust with field employees. Starting in 2015, we have redefined safety success as the Control and Removal of Exposures (C.A.R.E.) for self and others and encourage employees to report near miss incidents with serious, life-altering or fatal injury potential, identifying and reporting serious injury exposures for which employees are personally recognized and rewarded monetarily for exemplifying our Actively C.A.R.E culture. We believe trust is key to organizational health, as well as safety and operational success. 
 SIF Strategy 
 We are committed to controlling and removing SIF exposures at any H P rig or facility. We continue to track traditional safety metrics, such as TRIR, to be responsive to customer requests and industry benchmarking, but do not use these metrics as the foundation for our safety culture. H P data shows that only a small portion of OSHA recordable incidents provide value in preventing potential serious injuries. Incidents that do not result in an injury, but have the potential for a serious injury or fatality provide many more learning opportunities for preventing future serious injuries or fatalities. Based on this data we have a guided approach to incident investigations and corrective actions. Incidents that have the potential to cause a serious injury or fatality are escalated. Our safety success at H P will be based on key performance indicators related to the removal of SIF exposures, such as SIF Potential and SIF Mitigated rates. Our vision for the future of safety at H P will be guided by these principles.

 Diversity, Equity Inclusion 
 We believe that creating an environment where our employees feel valued and respected drives engagement, better leverages the unique talents and perspectives of our people to innovate and enhances our ability to attract and retain a diverse workforce. H P has employed a DE I Principal Specialist, implemented a thriving Women of H P Employee Resource Group, and established a DE I Advisory Council with global employee representation. Our commitments are evidenced by formalized policies regarding equal opportunity and a discrimination-free workplace. We are actively tracking diversity data to better understand demographics within the organization. 
 Employee Benefits, Health and Wellness 
 H P values its employees and believes competitive compensation and benefit packages are essential to prioritizing the well-being of its staff. Select highlights of our benefits programs include: 
 Medical, dental and vision insurance for all full-time employees, and all part-time employees working more than 20 hours per week, and their dependents; 
 A 401(k) plan with Company match incentive for all full-time employees, and all part-time employees working more than 20 hours per week; 
 Employer paid life insurance benefits, which include a life assistance program, identity theft protection, and travel assistance plan; 
 The Employee Assistance Plan, which offers wellness support with counseling, legal assistance, financial coaching, and identity theft resolution; 
 The H P Way Fund, which provides financial assistance to H P employees during unavoidable emergencies; 
 Employee discounts for phone, computer, personal vehicle, car rental, and hotel purchases; and 
 An Educational Assistance Plan, which offers reimbursement of tuition fees for any employee pursuing an undergraduate degree and, in some cases, post-graduate degrees. 
 Insurance and Risk Management 
 Our operations are subject to a number of operational risks, including personal injury and death, environmental, cyber, and weather risks, which could expose us to significant losses and damage claims. We are not fully insured against all of these risks and our contractual indemnity provisions may not fully protect us. Furthermore, if a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable or recoverable indemnity from a customer, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We have indemnification agreements with many of our customers and we also maintain liability and other forms of insurance. In general, our drilling contracts contain provisions requiring our customers to indemnify us for, among other things, well control events and reservoir damage. However, our contractual rights to indemnification may be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts by us, or subcontractors and/or suppliers or by reason of state anti-indemnity laws. Our customers and other third parties may also dispute these indemnification provisions, or we may be unable to transfer these risks to our drilling customers or other third parties by contract or indemnification agreements. 
 We insure working land rigs and related property and equipment at values that approximate the current replacement costs on the inception date of the policies. However, we self-insure large deductibles under these policies. We also carry insurance with varying deductibles and coverage limits with respect to stacked rigs, offshore platform rigs, and named wind storm risk in the Gulf of Mexico. 
 We have insurance coverage for comprehensive general liability, automobile liability, workers compensation and employer s liability, and certain other specific risks. Insurance is purchased over deductibles to reduce our exposure to catastrophic events. We retain a significant portion of our expected losses under our workers compensation, general liability and automobile liability programs. We self-insure a number of other risks including loss of earnings and business interruption. We are unable to obtain significant amounts of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage.

Table of Contents 

 Our insurance may not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our operations. Our coverage includes aggregate policy limits. As a result, we retain the risk for any loss in excess of these limits. No assurance can be given that all or a portion of our coverage will not be canceled, that insurance coverage will continue to be available at rates considered reasonable or that our coverage will respond to a specific loss. Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from our insurers or our insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage. For further information see Item 1A Risk Factors Business and Operating Risks Our drilling and technology related operations are subject to a number of operational risks, including environmental and weather risks, which could expose us to significant losses and damage claims. We are not fully insured against all of these risks and our contractual indemnity provisions may not fully protect us. 
 Government Regulations 
 Our operations are affected from time to time and in varying degrees by foreign and domestic political developments and a variety of federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations, including those relating to: 
 drilling of oil and natural gas wells; 
 directional drilling services; 
 protection of the environment; 
 workplace health and safety; 
 labor and employment; 
 data privacy; 
 taxation; 
 exportation or importation of equipment, technology and software; 
 currency conversion and repatriation; 
 global anti-corruption laws; and 
 government sanctions and embargo listing. 
 Environmental laws and regulations that apply to our operations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 CERCLA ), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (each, as amended) and similar laws that provide for responses to, and liability for, air emissions, water discharges or releases of oil or hazardous substances into the environment, including damages to natural resources. Applicable environmental laws and regulations also include similar foreign, state or local counterparts to the above-mentioned federal laws, which regulate air emissions, water discharges, and management of hazardous substances and waste. Environmental laws can have a material adverse effect on the drilling industry, including our operations, and compliance with such laws may require us to make significant capital expenditures, such as the installation of costly equipment or operational changes, and may affect the resale values or useful lives of our drilling rigs. 
 The Occupational Safety and Health Act and other similar laws and regulations govern the protection of the health and safety of employees. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the Environmental Protection Agency community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and similar state statutes and local regulations require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governments, emergency responders and citizens. 
 A number of countries actively regulate and control the importation and/or exportation of oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industries in their countries. In addition, government actions and initiatives by OPEC+ may continue to contribute to oil price volatility. In some areas of the world, government activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work done by oil and gas companies and influenced their need for drilling services, and likely will continue to do so.

 In addition, we are subject to a variety of other U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, and data privacy, data security and consumer protection laws. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Data privacy, data security, and consumer protection laws in the U.S. that apply to our operations include the Critical Infrastructure Act and the CAN-SPAM Act, and at the state level, the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act CPRA ). Because we conduct business in France and the UK, we are also subject to the European General Data Protection Regulation GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act. Our operations in the Middle East and Colombia are subject to similar data privacy and data protection laws. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines, penalties or other sanctions. For more information, see Item 1A Risk Factors Failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or foreign anti bribery legislation could adversely affect our business and Our business is subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy, data security and consumer protection. 
 We are also subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Commerce Department s Bureau of Industry and Security, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing the international trade of goods, services and technology. Such regulations regarding exports and imports of covered goods or dealings with sanctioned countries, persons or entities include licensing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to customs, tariffs, sanctions and export controls may subject us to criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions or seizures of assets. For more information, see Item 1A Risk Factors Government policies, mandates, and regulations specifically affecting the energy sector and related industries, regulatory policies or matters that affect a variety of businesses, taxation polices, and political instability could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 We are also subject to regulation by numerous other regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Labor, which sets employment practice standards for workers. In addition, we are subject to certain requirements to contribute to retirement funds or other benefit plans, and laws in some jurisdictions may require payment of statutorily calculated amounts to employees upon termination of employment. 
 We monitor our compliance with applicable governmental rules and regulations in each country of operation. We have made and will continue to make the required expenditures to comply with current and future regulatory requirements. We do not anticipate that compliance with currently applicable rules and regulations and required controls will significantly change our competitive position, capital spending or earnings during fiscal year 2024. We believe we are materially compliant with applicable rules and regulations and, to date, the cost of such compliance has not been material to our business or financial condition. However, future events such as additional laws and regulations, changes in existing laws and regulations or their interpretation or more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies, may require additional expenditures by us, which may be material. Specifically, the expansion of the scope of laws or regulations protecting the environment has accelerated in recent years, particularly outside the United States, and we expect this trend to continue. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant compliance costs in the future. See Item 1A Risk Factors Failure to comply with or changes to governmental and environmental laws could adversely affect our business.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 An investment in our securities involves a variety of risks. In addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K and the risk factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be carefully considered, as they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There may be other additional risks, uncertainties and matters not presently known to us or that we believe to be immaterial that could nevertheless have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 BUSINESS AND OPERATING RISKS 
 Our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, which is significantly impacted by the current and expected price of oil and natural gas as well as the volatility in those prices and other factors. 
 
 Our business depends on the conditions of the land and offshore oil and natural gas industry. Demand for our services and the rates we are able to charge for such services depend on oil and natural gas industry exploration and production activity and expenditure levels, which are directly affected by both long- and short-term trends in oil and natural gas prices and market expectations regarding such prices. Oil prices are particularly sensitive to actual and perceived threats to geopolitical stability, global economic conditions, and to changes in production from OPEC+ member states. For example, the ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas and the continuation of, or any escalation in the severity of, these conflicts, has led and may continue to lead to an increase in the volatility of global oil and gas prices, which could have a corresponding negative impact on the capital expenditure of oil and gas companies as a result of the higher perceived risk. Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a sharp decline in oil prices and drilling activity in 2020. 
 Oil and natural gas prices and production levels, as well as market expectations regarding such prices and production levels, have been volatile, which has had, and may in the future have, adverse effects on our business and operations. The volatility in prices and production levels are impacted by many factors beyond our control, including: 
 the domestic and foreign supply of, and demand for, oil, natural gas and related products; 
 the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas; 
 uncertainty in capital and commodities markets and the ability of oil and natural gas producers to access capital; 
 the availability of and constraints in storage and transportation capacity, including, for example, takeaway constraints experienced in the Permian Basin over the past several years; 
 the worldwide economy; 
 expectations about future oil and natural gas prices and production levels; 
 local and international political, economic, health and weather conditions, especially in oil and natural gas producing countries, including, for example, the impacts of local and international pandemics and other disasters; 
 actions of OPEC, its members and other oil producing nations, such as Russia, relating to oil price and production levels, including announcements of potential changes to such levels; 
 the levels of production of oil and natural gas of non-OPEC countries; 
 the continued development of shale plays which may influence worldwide supply and prices; 
 tax policies of the United States and other countries involved in global energy markets; 
 political and military conflicts, hostilities or perceived hostilities in oil producing regions or other geographical areas or acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere;

 technological advances that are related to oil and natural gas recovery or that affect the global demand for energy; 
 the development, exploitation and market acceptance of alternative energy sources as part of a transition to a lower carbon economy; 
 increased focus by the investment community on sustainability practices in the oil and natural gas industry; 
 legal and other limitations or restrictions on exportation and/or importation of oil and natural gas; 
 laws and governmental regulations affecting the use of oil and natural gas; and 
 the environmental and other laws and governmental regulations affecting exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves. 
 The level of land and offshore exploration, development and production activity and the prices of oil and natural gas are volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Higher oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily translate into increased activity because demand for our services is typically driven by our customers expectations of future commodity prices, as well as our customers' ability to access sources of capital to fund their operating and capital expenditures. However, a sustained decline in worldwide demand for oil and natural gas, as well as excess supply of oil or natural gas coupled with storage and transportation capacity constraints, shutting in of wells or wells being drilled but not completed, prolonged low oil or natural gas prices or a reduction in the ability of our customers to access capital, has resulted in, and may in the future result in, reduced exploration and development of land and offshore areas and a decline in the demand for our services, which has had, and may in the future, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Global economic conditions and volatility in oil and gas prices may adversely affect our business. 
 
 Concerns over global economic conditions, energy costs, geopolitical issues, supply chain disruptions, inflation, the availability and cost of credit have contributed to increased economic uncertainty. An economic slowdown or recession in the United States or in any other country that significantly affects the supply of or demand for oil or natural gas could negatively impact our operations and therefore adversely affect our results. Global economic conditions have a significant impact on oil and natural gas prices and stagnation or deterioration in global economic conditions could result in less demand for our services and could cause our customers to reduce their planned spending on exploration and development drilling. Adverse global economic conditions may cause our customers, vendors and/or suppliers to lose access to the financing necessary to sustain or increase their current level of operations, fulfill their commitments and/or fund future operations and obligations. Furthermore, challenging economic conditions may result in certain of our customers experiencing bankruptcy or otherwise becoming unable to pay vendors, including us. In the past, global economic conditions, and expectations for future global economic conditions, have sometimes experienced significant deterioration in a relatively short period of time and there can be no assurance that global economic conditions or expectations for future global economic conditions will recover in the near term or not quickly deteriorate again due to one or more factors. These conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The drilling services and solutions business is highly competitive, and a surplus of available drilling rigs may adversely affect our rig utilization and profit margins. 
 
 Competition in drilling services and solutions involves such factors as price, efficiency, condition, type and operational capability of equipment, reputation, operating safety, environmental impact, customer relations, rig availability and excess rig capacity in the industry. Competition may vary significantly by region at any particular time. Land drilling rigs can be readily moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity, which could result in an oversupply of rigs in any region, leading to increased price competition. In addition, development of new drilling technology by competitors has increased in recent years, which could negatively affect our ability to differentiate our services. 
 We periodically seek to increase the prices on our services to offset rising costs, earn returns on our capital investment and otherwise generate higher returns for our stockholders. However, we operate in a very competitive industry and we are not always successful in raising or maintaining our existing prices. From time to time we are able to increase our prices, but we may not be able to do so at a rate that is sufficient to offset rising costs. The inability to maintain our pricing and to increase our pricing as costs increase to offset rising costs and capital expenditures could adversely affect our rig utilization and profit margins. 
 Following periods of downturn in our industry, there may be substantially more drilling rigs available than necessary to meet demand even as oil and natural gas prices, and drilling activity, rebound. In the event of a surplus of available and more competitive drilling rigs, we may continue to experience difficulty in replacing fixed term contracts, extending expiring contracts or obtaining new contracts in the spot market, and new contracts may contain lower dayrates and substantially less favorable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As of September 30, 2023, 98 of our available rigs were not under contract. 
 2023 FORM 10-K | 19 

Table of Contents 

 Further, as a result of a significant reduction in the demand for oil and natural gas services, certain of our competitors may engage in bankruptcy proceedings, debt refinancing transactions, management changes, or other strategic initiatives in an attempt to reduce operating costs to maintain a position in the market. This could result in such competitors emerging with stronger or healthier balance sheets and in turn an improved ability to compete with us in the future. We may also see corporate consolidations among our competitors, which could significantly alter industry conditions and competition within the industry, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 New technologies may cause our drilling methods and equipment to become less competitive and it may become necessary to incur higher levels of capital expenditures in order to keep pace with the disruptive trends in the drilling industry. Growth through the building of new drilling rigs and improvement of existing rigs is not assured. 
 
 The market for our services is characterized by continual technological developments that have resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, substantial improvements in the functionality and performance, including environmental performance, of rigs and equipment. Our customers increasingly demand the services of newer, higher specification drilling rigs, as well as new and improved technology, such as drilling automation technology and lower-emissions operations and services. This results in a bifurcation of the drilling fleet and is evidenced by the higher specification drilling rigs (e.g., AC rigs) generally operating at higher overall utilization levels and dayrates than the lower specification drilling rigs (e.g., SCR rigs). In addition, a significant number of lower specification rigs are being stacked and/or removed from service. 
 Although we take measures to ensure that we develop and use advanced oil and natural gas drilling technology, changes in technology, improvements by competitors and increasing customer demands for new and improved technology could make our equipment less competitive. There can be no assurance that we will: 
 have sufficient capital resources to improve existing rigs or build new, technologically advanced drilling rigs; 
 avoid cost overruns inherent in large fabrication projects resulting from numerous factors such as shortages or unscheduled delays in delivery of equipment or materials, inadequate levels of skilled labor, unanticipated increases in costs of equipment, materials and labor, design and engineering problems, and financial or other difficulties; 
 successfully deploy idle, stacked, new or upgraded drilling rigs; 
 effectively manage the increased size or future growth of our organization and drilling fleet; 
 maintain crews necessary to operate existing or additional drilling rigs; or 
 successfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of improving existing drilling rigs or building new drilling rigs. 
 In the event that we are successful in developing new technologies for use in our business, there is no guarantee of future demand for those technologies. Customers may be reluctant or unwilling to adopt our new technologies. We may also have difficulty negotiating satisfactory terms for our technology services or may be unable to secure prices sufficient to obtain expected returns on our investment in the research and development of new technologies. 
 If we are not successful in upgrading existing rigs and equipment or building new rigs in a timely and cost effective manner suitable to customer needs, demand for our services could decline and we could lose market share. One or more technologies that we may implement in the future may not work as we expect and our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected as a result. Additionally, new technologies, services or standards could render some of our services, drilling rigs or equipment obsolete, which could reduce our competitiveness and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our drilling and technology related operations are subject to a number of operational risks, including environmental and weather risks, which could expose us to significant losses and damage claims. We are not fully insured against all of these risks and our contractual indemnity provisions may not fully protect us. 
 
 Our operations are subject to the many hazards inherent in the business, including inclement weather, unplanned power outages, blowouts, explosions, well fires, loss of well control, equipment failure, computer system disruptions, pollution, and reservoir damage. These hazards could cause significant environmental and reservoir damage, personal injury and death, suspension of operations, serious damage or destruction of equipment and property and substantial damage to producing formations and surrounding lands and waters. An accident or other event resulting in significant environmental or property damage, or injuries or fatalities involving our employees or other persons could also trigger investigations by federal, state or local authorities. Such an accident or other event and subsequent crisis management efforts could cause us to incur substantial expenses in connection with investigation and remediation as well as cause lasting damage to our reputation, loss of customers and an inability to obtain insurance.

 Our Offshore Gulf of Mexico operations are also subject to potentially significant risks and liabilities attributable to or resulting from adverse environmental conditions, including pollution of offshore waters and related negative impact on wildlife and habitat, adverse sea conditions and platform damage or destruction due to collision with aircraft or marine vessels. Our Offshore Gulf of Mexico operations may also be negatively affected by a blowout or an uncontrolled release of oil or hazardous substances by third parties whose offshore operations are unrelated to our operations. We operate several platform rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf of Mexico experiences hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions on a frequent basis, which may increase in frequency and severity as a result of climate change. See below The physical effects of climate change and the regulation of greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business. Damage caused by high winds and turbulent seas could potentially curtail operations on our platform rigs for significant periods of time until the damage can be repaired. Moreover, we may experience disruptions in operations due to damage to customer platforms and other related facilities in the area. We also lease a fabrication facility near the Houston, Texas ship channel, and our principal fabricator and other vendors are also located in the gulf coast region and could be exposed to damage or disruption by hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions, including coastal flooding, which in turn could result in increased operating costs or decreases in revenues and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 It is customary in our business to have mutual indemnification agreements with customers on a knock-for-knock basis, which means that we and our customers assume liability for our respective personnel, subcontractors, and property. In general, our drilling contracts contain provisions requiring our customers to indemnify us for, among other things, well control events and reservoir damage. However, our contractual rights to indemnification may be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts by us, our subcontractors and/or suppliers. Additionally, certain states, including Texas, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Louisiana, have enacted statutes generally referred to as "oilfield anti-indemnity acts," which expressly limit certain indemnity agreements contained in or related to indemnification in contracts, and could expose the Company to financial loss. Furthermore, other states may enact similar oilfield anti-indemnity acts. 
 Our customers and other third parties may also dispute, or be unable to meet, their contractual indemnification obligations to us. Accordingly, we may be unable to transfer these risks to our customers and other third parties by contract or indemnification agreements. Incurring a liability for which we are not fully indemnified or insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We insure working land rigs and related equipment at values that approximate the current replacement cost on the inception date of the policies. We also carry insurance with varying deductibles and coverage limits with respect to stacked rigs, offshore platform rigs, and named wind storm risk in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, we have insurance coverage for comprehensive general liability, automobile liability, workers compensation and employer s liability, and certain other specific risks. Insurance is purchased over deductibles to reduce our exposure to catastrophic events. In some cases, we self-insure large deductibles on certain insurance policies. We retain a significant portion of our expected losses under our workers compensation, general liability and automobile liability programs. The Company self insures a number of other risks, including loss of earnings and business interruption. We are unable to obtain significant amounts of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage. Our insurance will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all losses and liabilities that could result from our operations. Our coverage includes aggregate policy limits. As a result, we retain the risk for any loss in excess of these limits. No assurance can be given that insurance coverage will continue to be available at rates considered reasonable or that our coverage will respond to a specific loss. In addition, our insurance may not cover losses associated with pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from our insurers or our insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage. 
 If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable or recoverable indemnity from a customer, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our business is subject to cybersecurity and information technology system disruption risks. 
 
 Our operations depend on effective and secure information technology systems, including our own systems and the systems of third party vendors upon which we rely, such as those providing cloud services to us. Threats to information technology systems, including as a result of Security Incidents, continue to grow. Cybersecurity risks could include, but are not limited to, Security Incidents, such as ransomware attacks, denial-of-service attacks, phishing attacks, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and the unauthorized release, corruption or loss of our data and personal information, employee or insider error, interruptions in communication, loss of our intellectual property or theft of our FlexRig and other sensitive or proprietary technology, loss or damage to our data delivery systems, or other cybersecurity and infrastructure systems, including our property and equipment. In 2021, the Company introduced full-time or part-time remote work as a permanent option for select employees and a significant number of our corporate employees now work remotely. Remote work relies heavily on the use of remote networking and online conferencing services that enable employees to work outside of our corporate infrastructure and, in some cases, use their own personal devices, which exposes the Company to additional cybersecurity risks. Furthermore, geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as the ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas, may further heighten the risk of cybersecurity attacks. Our information technology systems and those of our third party vendors are also subject to disruptions due to occurrences other than Security Incidents, such as natural disasters or power outages. 
 2023 FORM 10-K | 21 

Table of Contents 

 Security Incidents or other disruptions involving our own systems or those of our third-party vendors, could: 
 disrupt our operations including operational technologies as well as our corporate information technology systems, 
 negatively impact our ability to compete, 
 result in the theft or misappropriation of funds, 
 cause the loss, corruption or misappropriation of personal, proprietary or confidential information, 
 expose us to litigation, regulatory action, and potential liability, and 
 result in injury to our reputation, downtime, loss of revenue, and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate Security Incidents or other disruptions. 
 It is possible that our business, financial and other systems, as well as those of our third-party vendors, could be compromised. While various procedures and controls are being utilized to mitigate exposure to such risk, there can be no assurance that the procedures and controls that we implement, or which we cause third party service providers to implement, will be sufficient to protect our systems, information or other property. A Security Incident or other disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations. Further, as Security Incidents continue to evolve, we may be required to incur additional costs to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate or remediate the effects of Security Incidents. 
 Our acquisitions, dispositions and investments may not result in anticipated benefits and may present risks not originally contemplated, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition. 
 
 We continually seek opportunities to maximize efficiency and value through various transactions, including purchases or sales of assets, businesses, investments, or joint venture interests. These strategic transactions, among others, are intended to (but may not) result in the realization of savings, the creation of efficiencies, the offering of new products or services, the generation of cash or income, or the reduction of risk. Acquisition transactions may use cash on hand or be financed by additional borrowings or by the issuance of our common stock. These transactions may also affect our liquidity, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition. 
 These transactions also involve risks, and we cannot ensure that: 
 any acquisitions we attempt will be completed on the terms announced, or at all; 
 any acquisitions would result in an increase in income or provide an adequate return of capital or other anticipated benefits; 
 any acquisitions would be successfully integrated into our operations and internal controls, including those related to financial reporting, disclosure and cyber and information security; 
 the due diligence conducted prior to an acquisition would uncover situations that could result in financial or legal exposure, or that we will appropriately quantify the exposure from known risks; 
 any disposition would not result in decreased earnings, revenue, or cash flow; 
 use of cash for acquisitions would not adversely affect our cash available for capital expenditures and other uses; or 
 any dispositions, investments, or acquisitions, including integration efforts, would not divert management resources. 
 We have allocated a portion of the purchase price of certain acquisitions to goodwill and other intangible assets. The amount allocated to goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired. At September 30, 2023, we had goodwill of 45.7 million and other intangible assets, net of 60.6 million. If we experience future negative changes in our business climate or our results of operations such that we determine that goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, we will be required to record impairment charges with respect to such assets.

 Technology disputes and limitations on our ability to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could negatively impact our costs, revenues, and any competitive advantage we hold. 
 
 Drilling rigs use proprietary technology and equipment which can involve potential infringement of a third party s rights, or a third party s infringement of our rights, including patent rights. The majority of the intellectual property rights relating to our drilling rigs and technology services are owned by us or certain of our supplying vendors. From time to time, we or our customers or supplying vendors become involved in disputes over infringement of intellectual property rights relating to equipment or technology owned or used by us. As a result, we may lose access to important equipment or technology, be required to cease use of some equipment or technology, be forced to modify our drilling rigs or technology, or be required to pay license fees or royalties for the use of equipment or technology. There can also be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights will be adequate. Our business may be adversely affected when our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology, our patent applications are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected. In addition, we may lose a competitive advantage in the event we are unsuccessful in enforcing our rights against third parties, third parties are successful in enforcing their rights against us, or our competitors are able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets. As a result, any technology disputes or limitations on our ability to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Unexpected events could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations. 
 Unexpected or unanticipated events, including, without limitation, computer system disruptions, unplanned power outages, fires or explosions at drilling rigs, natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes (occurrences of which may increase in frequency and severity as a result of climate change), war or terrorist activities, supply disruptions, failure of equipment, changes in laws and/or regulations impacting our businesses, pandemic illness and other unforeseeable circumstances that may arise from our increasingly connected world or otherwise, could adversely affect our business. It is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events. However, any such events could create unforeseen liabilities, reduce our ability to provide drilling and related technology services, reduce demand for our services, or make it more difficult or costly to provide services, any of which may ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Reliance on management and competition for experienced personnel may negatively impact our operations or financial results. 
 
 We greatly depend on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees to manage our operations. Similarly, we utilize highly skilled personnel in operating and supporting our businesses and in developing new technologies. In times of high utilization, it can be difficult to find and retain qualified individuals and, during the recent period of sustained declines in oil and natural gas prices, there have been reductions in the oil field services workforce, both of which have resulted and may in the future result in higher labor costs. The loss of members of management or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the unexpected loss of members of management, qualified personnel or a significant number of employees due to disease, disability, or death, could have a detrimental effect on us. 
 The loss of one or a number of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 In fiscal year 2023, we received approximately 50.4 percent of our consolidated operating revenues from our ten largest drilling services and solutions customers and approximately 24.2 percent of our consolidated operating revenues from our three largest customers (including their affiliates). If one or more of our larger customers terminated their contracts, failed to renew existing contracts with us, or refused to award us with new contracts, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, consolidation among oil and natural gas exploration and production companies may reduce the number of available customers. 
 Our current backlog of drilling services and solutions revenue may decline and may not be ultimately realized as fixed term contracts and may, in certain instances, be terminated without an early termination payment. 
 
 Fixed term drilling contracts customarily provide for a termination by the customer for convenience, default, or extended force majeure. An early termination payment is typically paid to us if a contract is terminated prior to the expiration of the fixed term. However, in the event of default, such as destruction of a drilling rig, our bankruptcy, sustained unacceptable performance by us or delivery of a rig beyond certain grace and/or liquidated damage periods, no early termination payment would be paid to us. Even if an early termination payment is owed to us, during depressed market conditions or due to other factors, a customer may be unable or may refuse to pay the early termination payment and may seek to suspend, negotiate, or terminate the contract. 
 2023 FORM 10-K | 23 

Table of Contents 

 Regardless of the reason for an early termination or suspension of a contract, such termination or suspension may result in a drilling rig being idle for an extended period of time if we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As of September 30, 2023, our drilling services backlog was approximately 1.4 billion for future revenues under firm commitments. Our drilling services backlog may decline over time as existing contract term coverage may not be offset by new term contracts or price modifications for existing contracts, as a result of any number of factors, such as low or declining oil prices and capital spending reductions by our customers. Our inability or the inability of our customers to perform under our or their contractual obligations may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our contracts with national oil companies may expose us to greater risks than we normally assume in contracts with non-governmental customers. 
 
 We currently own and operate rigs and have deployed technology under contracts with foreign national oil companies. In the future, we may expand our international solutions operations and enter into additional, significant contracts with national oil companies. The terms of these contracts may contain non-negotiable provisions and may expose us to greater commercial, political, operational and other risks than we assume in other contracts. Foreign contracts may expose us to materially greater environmental liability and other claims for damages (including consequential damages) and personal injury related to our operations, or the risk that the contract may be terminated by our customer without cause on short-term notice, contractually or by governmental action, or under certain conditions that may not provide us with an early termination payment. We can provide no assurance that increased risk exposure will not have an adverse impact on our future operations or that we will not increase the number of rigs contracted, or the amount of technology deployed, to national oil companies with commensurate additional contractual risks. Risks that accompany contracts with national oil companies could ultimately have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our drilling services operating expense includes fixed costs that may not decline in proportion to decreases in rig utilization and dayrates. 
 
 Our drilling services operating expense includes all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation, maintenance and support of our drilling equipment, which is often not affected by changes in dayrates and utilization. During periods of reduced revenue and/or activity, certain of our fixed costs (such as depreciation) may not decline and often we may incur additional costs. During times of reduced utilization , reductions in costs may not be immediate as we may incur additional costs associated with maintaining and cold stacking a rig, or we may not be able to fully reduce the cost of our support operations in a particular geographic region due to the need to support the remaining drilling rigs in that region. Accordingly, a decline in revenue due to lower dayrates and/or utilization may not be offset by a corresponding decrease in drilling services and solutions expense, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Shortages of drilling equipment, supplies or other key materials could adversely affect our operations. 
 
 The drilling services and solutions business is highly cyclical. During periods of increased demand for drilling services and solutions and periods of supply chain disruption, delays in delivery and shortages of drilling equipment and supplies can occur and it may take longer for our suppliers to service drilling components. Additionally, suppliers may seek to increase prices for equipment, supplies, and services, which we are unable to pass through to our customers, either due to contractual obligations or market constraints in the drilling services and solutions business. Further, certain key rig components, parts and equipment are also either purchased from, fabricated or serviced by a limited number of vendors, which, in some cases, may be thinly capitalized and disproportionately affected by any loss of business, downturn in the energy industry, supply chain disruptions, or reduction or availability of credit. A number of disruptions and delays across the global supply chain have occurred in recent years, which have created delays in servicing key components, and a tightening of supplies and shortages in a number of areas, ranging from basic raw materials to component parts, and increasing costs, and it is possible such disruptions and delays could continue in the near term and possibly beyond. To date, as an industry leader, we have effectively managed these delays, disruptions, and shortages by engaging in near and long-term demand planning with multiple suppliers who provide and service key rig components, parts and equipment. However, if we are not able to effectively manage these disruptions and delays in the future, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Unionization efforts and labor regulations in certain countries in which we operate could materially increase our costs or limit our flexibility. 
 
 Certain of our international employees are unionized, and efforts may be made from time to time to unionize other portions of our workforce. We may in the future be subject to strikes or work stoppages and other labor disruptions in connection with unionization efforts or renegotiation of existing contracts with unions representing our international employees. For example, worker strikes of short duration are common in Argentina and our operations have experienced such strikes in the past. Union expansion, if successful, new collective bargaining agreements or work stoppages could materially increase our labor costs, reduce our revenues or limit our operational flexibility. Further, our responses to any union organizing efforts could negatively impact our reputation and have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The impact and effects of public health crises, pandemics and epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Public health crises, pandemics and epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and fear of such events have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our operations, the operations of our customers and the global economy, including the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas and the level of demand for our services. Such public health crises, pandemics and epidemics are continuously evolving, and we are not able to enumerate all potential risks to our business from such events, including the COVID-19 pandemic; however, we believe that in addition to the impacts described above, other current and potential impacts include, but are not limited to: significant volatility and disruption of the global financial markets; continued volatility of crude oil prices and related uncertainties around OPEC+ production; disruption of our operations, including suspension of drilling activities; impact to costs; loss of workers; labor shortages; supply chain disruptions or equipment shortages; logistics constraints; customer demand for our services and industry demand generally; capital spending by oil and gas companies; our liquidity; the price of our securities and trading markets with respect thereto; our ability to access capital markets; asset impairments and other accounting changes; certain of our customers experiencing bankruptcy or otherwise becoming unable to pay vendors, including us; and employee impacts from illness, travel restrictions, including border closures and other community response measures. The full extent of the impact of public health crises, pandemics and epidemics on our business operations and financial results will depend largely on future developments and various factors beyond our control, such as the duration, severity and sustained geographic spread, and the impact and effectiveness of governmental actions to contain and treat such outbreaks, including government policies and restrictions; vaccine hesitancy, vaccine mandates, and voluntary or mandatory quarantines; and the global response surrounding such uncertainties. 
 Improvements in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements and increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. Since our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, any improvement in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies that increase the use of alternative forms of energy and reduce the demand for oil and natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by foreign political, economic and social instability risks, foreign currency restrictions and devaluation, and various local laws associated with doing business in certain foreign countries. 
 
 We currently have drilling operations in South America (primarily Argentina and Colombia), the Middle East and Australia. In the future, we may further expand the geographic reach of our operations. As a result, we are exposed to several political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered in U.S. operations, including increased risks of social unrest, strikes, terrorism, war, kidnapping of employees, nationalization, and forced negotiation or modification of contracts; difficulty resolving disputes (including technology disputes) and enforcing contract provisions, expropriation of equipment as well as expropriation of oil and gas exploration and drilling rights; taxation policies; foreign exchange restrictions and restrictions on repatriation of income and capital; currency rate fluctuations; increased governmental ownership and regulation of the economy and industry in the markets in which we operate; economic and financial instability of national oil companies; restrictive governmental regulation; bureaucratic delays; and general hazards associated with foreign sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted.

 South American countries, in particular, have historically experienced uneven periods of economic growth, as well as recession, periods of high inflation and general economic and political instability. From time to time, these risks have impacted our business. For example, in Argentina, while our dayrate is denominated in U.S. dollars, we are paid in Argentine pesos and Argentina has a history of implementing currency controls, which limit our ability to access U.S. Dollars in Argentina and repatriate cash from our Argentina operations. Argentina s economy is currently considered highly inflationary, which is defined as cumulative inflation rates exceeding 100 in the most recent three-year period based on inflation data published by the respective governments. Nonetheless, all of our foreign operations use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency and local currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars with gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions included in current results of operations. For fiscal year 2023, we recognized aggregate foreign currency losses of 7.4 million in Argentina. Our aggregate foreign currency losses across all of our operations for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 were 6.4 million, 5.9 million and 5.3 million, respectively. However, in the future, we may incur larger currency devaluations, foreign exchange restrictions or other difficulties repatriating U.S. dollars from Argentina or elsewhere, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Central Bank of Argentina maintains currency controls that limit our ability to access U.S. dollars in Argentina and remit cash from our Argentine operations. The execution of certain trades known as Blue Chip Swaps effectively results in a parallel U.S. dollar exchange rate. During the fiscal year ended 2023, we entered into a Blue Chip Swap transaction, which resulted in a 12.2 million loss on investment recorded in Gain on investment securities within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As a result of the Blue Chip Swap transaction, 9.8 million of net cash was repatriated to the U.S. during the period. 
 Additionally, there can be no assurance that there will not be changes in local laws, regulations and administrative requirements or the interpretation thereof, which could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our operations or on our ability to continue operations in certain areas. Because of the impact of local laws, our future operations in certain areas may be conducted through entities in which local citizens own interests and through entities (including joint ventures) in which we have limited control or hold only a minority interest or pursuant to arrangements under which we conduct operations under contract to local entities. There can be no assurance that we will in all cases be able to structure or restructure our operations to conform to local law (or the administration thereof) on terms we find acceptable. 
 The future occurrence of one or more international events arising from the types of risks described above could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 FINANCIAL RISKS 
 Covenants in our debt agreements restrict our ability to engage in certain activities. 
 
 Our current debt agreements pertaining to certain long term unsecured debt and our unsecured revolving credit facility contain, and our future financing arrangements likely will contain, various covenants that may in certain instances restrict our ability to, among other things, incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness, incur liens, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, enter into new lines of business, and merge or consolidate. In addition, our credit facility requires us to maintain a funded leverage ratio (as defined therein) of less than or equal to 50 percent and certain priority debt (as defined therein) may not exceed 17.5 percent of our net worth (as defined therein). Such restrictions may limit our ability to successfully execute our business plans, which may have adverse consequences on our operations. 
 We may be required to record impairment charges with respect to our drilling rigs and other assets. 
 
 We evaluate our drilling rigs and other assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Lower utilization and dayrates adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates may result in the recognition of impairment charges if future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, indicate that the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable. Drilling rigs in our fleet may become impaired in the future if oil and gas prices decline or remain low for a prolonged period of time or if market conditions deteriorate or if we restructure our drilling fleet. For example, in fiscal year 2021 we recognized impairment charges of 70.9 million related to tangible assets and equipment. If we experience future negative changes in our business climate such that we determine that one or more of our asset groups are impaired, we will be required to record additional impairment charges with respect to such asset groups. 
 Any impairment could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. The facts and circumstances included in our impairment assessments are described in Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

 A downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital. 
 
 Our ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings as provided by major U.S. credit rating agencies. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, commodity pricing levels, industry conditions and other considerations. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability in the future to access debt markets, increase the cost of future debt, and potentially require us to post letters of credit for certain obligations. 
 Our ability to access capital markets could be limited. 
 
 From time to time, we may need to access capital markets to obtain financing. Our ability to access capital markets for financing could be limited by oil and gas prices, our existing capital structure, our credit ratings, the state of the economy, the health or market perceptions of the drilling and overall oil and gas industry, the liquidity of the capital markets and other factors. Many of the factors that affect our ability to access capital markets are outside of our control. No assurance can be given that we will be able to access capital markets on terms acceptable to us when required to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our marketable securities may lose significant value due to credit, market and interest rate risks. 
 
 The value of our marketable securities are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by unusual events, such as global health crises and political instability. A significant loss in value of our investments would negatively impact our debt ratio and financial strength. 
 We may not be able to generate cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations. 
 
 Our ability to make future scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations, including any future debt obligations, depends on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investment decisions and capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Furthermore, these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial position at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would be a default (if not waived) and would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. 
 LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS 
 The physical effects of climate change and the regulation of greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business. 
 
 The physical and regulatory effects of climate change and a global transition to a low carbon economy could have a negative impact on our operations, our customers operations and the overall demand for our customers' products and services. Scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as greenhouse gases GHGs and including carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes. In response to such studies, the issue of climate change and the effect of GHG emissions, in particular emissions from fossil fuels, is attracting increasing attention worldwide and there are a number of political and technological initiatives aimed at reducing the use of hydrocarbons. 
 We are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, regional, national and international regulatory bodies on GHG emissions and climate change issues. Legislation to regulate GHG emissions has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress and such legislation may be proposed or adopted in the future. In addition, the United States is currently a member of the Paris Agreement that requires member countries to review and represent a progression in their intended nationally determined GHG contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. 
 2023 FORM 10-K | 27 

Table of Contents 

 The aim of the Paris Agreement is to hold the increase in the average global temperature to well below 2 C (3.6 F) above pre-industrial levels with efforts to limit the rise to 1.5 C (2.7 F) to protect against the more severe consequences of climate change forecasted by scientific studies. These consequences include increased coastal flooding, droughts and associated wildfires, heavy precipitation events, stresses on water supply and agriculture, increased poverty, and negative impacts on health. In connection with the decision to adopt the Paris Agreement, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the IPCC prepared a special report focused on the impacts of an increase in the average global temperature of 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels and related GHG emission pathways. The 2018 IPCC Report concludes that the measures set forth in the Paris Agreement are insufficient and that more aggressive targets and measures will be needed. According to the 2023 IPCC Report, all global modelled pathways limiting warming to 1.5 C or 2 C requires rapid and deep and, in most cases, immediate greenhouse gas emissions reductions in all sectors this decade. 
 It is not possible at this time to predict the timing and effect of climate change or whether additional GHG legislation, regulations or other measures will be adopted at the federal, state or local levels. However, more aggressive efforts by governments and non-governmental organizations to reduce GHG emissions appear likely based on the findings set forth in the IPCC Reports and any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions or affect the demand for our customers' products and, accordingly, our services. In addition, increasing attention to the risks of climate change has resulted in an increased possibility of litigation or investigations brought by public and private entities against oil and gas companies in connection with their GHG emissions. As a result, we or our customers may become subject to court orders compelling a reduction of GHG emissions or requiring mitigation of the effects of climate change. For example, a coalition of over 20 governors of U.S. states formed the United States Climate Alliance to advance the objectives of the Paris Agreement, and several U.S. cities have committed to advance the objectives of the Paris Agreement at the state or local level as well. If we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs or are required to change our practices related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, to the extent financial markets view climate change and GHG emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of or access to capital. Climate change and GHG regulation could also negatively impact the drilling programs of our customers and, consequently, delay, limit or reduce the services we provide. An increased focus by the public on the reduction of GHG emissions as well as the results of the physical impacts of climate change could affect the demand for our customers products and have a negative effect on our business. 
 The federal government and certain state governments have enacted, and are expected to continue to enact, laws and regulations that mandate or provide economic incentives for the development of technologies and sources of energy other than oil and gas, such as wind and solar. Such legislation incentivizes the development, use and investment in these technologies and alternative energy sources and could accelerate the shift away from traditional oil and gas. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act ("IRA") of 2022 contains tax inducements and other provisions that incentivize investment, development, and deployment of alternative energy sources and technologies. Also, in 2022, California mandated that all new passenger cars and light trucks sold in the state be electric vehicles or other emissions-free models by 2035. If these future laws and regulations result in customers reducing their production of oil and gas, they could ultimately have an adverse effect on our business and prospects. 
 Beyond financial and regulatory impacts, the projected severe effects of climate change have the potential to directly affect our facilities and operations and those of our customers and suppliers, which could result in more frequent and severe disruptions to our business and those of our customers and suppliers, increased costs to repair damaged facilities or maintain or resume operations, and increased insurance costs. See above Our drilling and technology related operations are subject to a number of operational risks, including environmental and weather risks, which could expose us to significant losses and damage claims. We are not fully insured against all of these risks and our contractual indemnity provisions may not fully protect us.

 New legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing or other aspects of the oil and gas industry could negatively impact the drilling programs of our customers and, consequently, delay, limit or reduce the services we provide. 
 
 Several political and regulatory authorities, governmental bodies, and environmental groups devote resources to campaigns aimed at eradicating hydraulic fracking. We do not engage in any hydraulic fracturing activities. However, it is a common practice in our industry for our customers to recover natural gas and oil from shale and other formations through the use of horizontal drilling combined with hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is the process of creating or expanding cracks, or fractures, in formations using water, sand and other additives pumped under high pressure into the formation. The hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. Several states have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure, waste disposal and/or well construction requirements on oil and gas development, including hydraulic fracturing operations, or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. In addition to state laws, some local municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, that may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. Members of the U.S. Congress are analyzing, and a number of federal agencies have historically been requested to review, and, under the current administration, may be requested to review again, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing and the possibility of more stringent regulation. At September 30, 2023, we had approximately 24 rigs placed on federal land and four rigs in federal waters. Any new laws, regulations or permitting requirements regarding hydraulic fracturing could negatively impact the drilling programs of our customers and, consequently, delay, limit or reduce the services we provide. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels. Widespread regulation significantly restricting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing or other drilling activity by our customers could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Further, we conduct drilling activities in numerous states, including Oklahoma, where seismic activity may occur. In recent years, Oklahoma has experienced an increase in earthquakes. Although the extent of any correlation has been and remains the subject of studies of both federal and state agencies, some parties believe that there is a correlation between hydraulic fracturing related activities and the increased occurrence of seismic activity. As a result, federal and state legislatures and agencies may seek to further regulate, restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing activities. Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques, operational delays or increased operating and compliance costs in the production of oil and natural gas from shale plays, added difficulty in performing hydraulic fracturing, and potentially a decline in the completion of new oil and gas wells, which could negatively impact the drilling programs of our customers and, consequently, delay, limit or reduce the services we provide. 
 Our aspirations, goals and initiatives related to sustainability and emissions reduction, and our public statements and disclosures regarding them, expose us to numerous risks. 
 
 We have developed, and will continue to develop and set, goals, targets, or other objectives related to sustainability matters. Statements related to these goals, targets and objectives reflect our current plans and do not constitute a guarantee that they will be achieved. Our efforts to research, establish, accomplish, and accurately report on these goals, targets, and objectives expose us to numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks. Our ability to achieve any stated goal, target, or objective, including with respect to emissions reduction, is subject to numerous factors and conditions, some of which are outside of our control. Examples of such factors include: (1) the extent our customers' decisions directly impact, relate to, or influence the use of our equipment that creates the emissions we report, (2) the availability and cost of low- or non-carbon-based energy sources and technologies, (3) evolving regulatory requirements affecting sustainability standards or disclosures, and (4) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other standards. In addition, standards for tracking and reporting on sustainability matters, including climate-related matters, have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. Our processes and controls for reporting sustainability matters may not always comply with evolving and disparate standards for identifying, quantifying, and reporting such metrics, including sustainability-related disclosures that may be required of public companies by the SEC, and such standards may change over time, which could result in significant revisions to our current goals, reported progress in achieving such goals, or ability to achieve such goals in the future. Our business may also face increased scrutiny from investors and other stakeholders, including from parties that oppose environmental, social, and governance initiatives, related to our sustainability activities, including the goals, targets, and objectives that we announce, and our methodologies and timelines for pursuing them. If our sustainability practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment or business partner could be negatively affected. Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our sustainability-focused goals, targets, and objectives, to comply with ethical, environmental, or other standards, regulations, or expectations, or to satisfy various reporting standards with respect to these matters, within the timelines we announce, or at all, could adversely affect our business or reputation, as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation.

 Failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or foreign anti bribery legislation could adversely affect our business. 
 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA and similar anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices and impact our business. Although we have programs in place requiring compliance with anti bribery legislation, any failure to comply with the FCPA or other anti bribery legislation could subject us to civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation. In addition, investors could negatively view potential violations, inquiries or allegations of misconduct under the FCPA or similar laws, which could adversely affect our reputation and the market for our shares. We could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of drilling rigs or other assets. 
 Our business is subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy, data security and consumer protection. 
 
 The regulatory environment surrounding data privacy, data security and consumer protection is rapidly evolving and subject to constant change. New laws and regulations in this space pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate our costs. In the normal course of business, we and our third-party partners may collect, process, and store data that is subject to those specific laws and regulations governing personal data. 
 Complying with the varying regulatory requirements outlined in foreign, federal, state, and local regulations is becoming increasingly complex, and could increase the costs and difficulty of compliance. Furthermore, violations of applicable data protection laws, including but not limited to the GDPR and the CCPA as amended by the CPRA, as well as other U.S. sector-specific and new comprehensive state data privacy laws, could result in significant penalties. 
 The GDPR applies to entities operating in the EU that process personal data and entities outside the EU that process personal data to provide goods or services to EU residents, directly or indirectly through vendors and subcontractors. As interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR evolves, it creates a range of new compliance obligations, which could cause us to incur costs and require us to change our business practices in a manner that does not align with our business objectives. Failure to comply could result in significant penalties of up to a maximum of four percent of our total global turnover of the preceding financial year or up to 20.0 million, which may materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, and revenue. 
 The CCPA, which came into effect on January 1, 2020, was amended by the CPRA, which went into effect January 1, 2023. The CCPA and CPRA give California residents certain rights in relation to their personal information, and impose obligations on certain entities that do business in California to protect those rights, which may apply to us. As interpretation and enforcement of the CCPA and CPRA evolve, new compliance obligations are created, which could cause us to incur costs and shift our business practices in a manner that does not align with our business objectives. The CCPA, presently enforceable (as CPRA enforcement has been delayed until July 1, 2023, and enforcement is not retroactive), provides for civil penalties of up to 7,500 per intentional violation and 2,500 per unintentional violation. Additionally, California residents whose personal information has been impacted by a Security Incident as a result of the entity s failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices have been granted a private right of action, which could result in damages of up to 750 per incident, where the entity failed to encrypt or redact personal information. The possibility for these significant financial penalties for noncompliance may materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, and revenue. Similar legislation has been adopted in Virginia, Colorado, and Connecticut, which have gone into effect, and Utah which will go into effect at the end of 2023. 
 Non-compliance with these and other data privacy, data security, and consumer protection laws could also expose us to regulatory investigations, which could require significant expenses for resolution and potentially result in fines and prospective relief, necessitating additional resources for implementation. In addition, regulators may issue orders to stop processing personal data, which could disrupt operations. We could also be subject to litigation from persons or corporations allegedly affected by violations of these laws. It is also possible we could be subject to a Security Incident, which in addition to potential losses from fraudulent wire transfers, are costly to investigate and remediate and could result in a violation of data privacy and consumer protection laws (in addition to data security laws). Any violation of these laws or harm to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, reputation, or results of operations and prospects.

 Government policies, mandates, and regulations specifically affecting the energy sector and related industries, regulatory policies or matters that affect a variety of businesses, taxation polices, and political instability could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Energy production and trade flows are subject to government policies, mandates, regulations, and trade agreements. Governmental policies affecting the energy industry, such as taxes, tariffs, duties, price controls, subsidies, incentives, foreign exchange rates, economic sanctions and import and export restrictions, can influence the viability and volume of production of certain commodities, the volume and types of imports and exports, whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded, and industry profitability. For example, the decision of the U.S. government to impose tariffs on certain Chinese imports and the resulting retaliation by the Chinese government imposing a 25 percent tariff on U.S. liquefied natural gas have disrupted aspects of the energy market. Disruptions of this sort can affect the price of oil and natural gas and may cause our customers to change their plans for exploration and production levels, in turn reducing the demand for our services. Moreover, many countries, including the United States, control the import and export of certain goods, services and technology and impose related import and export recordkeeping and reporting obligations. Governments also may impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons and other entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities. In particular, U.S. sanctions are targeted against certain countries that are heavily involved in the petroleum and petrochemical industries, which includes drilling activities. 
 Future government policies may adversely affect the supply of, demand for, and prices of oil and natural gas, restrict our ability to do business in existing and target markets, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The laws and regulations concerning import and export activity, recordkeeping and reporting, including customs, export controls and economic sanctions, are complex and constantly changing. These laws and regulations may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner materially impacting our operations. Ongoing economic challenges may increase some governments efforts to enact, enforce, amend or interpret laws and regulations as a method to increase revenue. Shipments can be delayed and denied import or export for a variety of reasons, some of which are outside our control and some of which may result from failure to comply with existing legal and regulatory regimes. Shipping delays or denials could cause unscheduled operational downtime. Any failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements governing international trade could also result in criminal and civil penalties and sanctions, such as fines, imprisonment, debarment from government contracts, seizure of shipments and loss of import and export privileges. 
 Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be affected by political instability and by changes in other governmental policies, mandates, regulations, and trade agreements, including monetary, fiscal and environmental policies, laws, regulations, acquisition approvals, and other activities of governments, agencies, and similar organizations. These risks include, but are not limited to, changes in a country s or region s economic or political conditions, local labor conditions and regulations, safety and environmental regulations, reduced protection of intellectual property rights, changes in the regulatory or legal environment, restrictions on currency exchange activities, currency exchange fluctuations, burdensome taxes and tariffs, enforceability of legal agreements and judgments, adverse tax, administrative agency or judicial outcomes, and regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases. International risks and uncertainties, including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism, political hostilities, and war, could limit our ability to transact business in these markets and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Legal claims and litigation could have a negative impact on our business. 
 
 The nature of our business makes us susceptible to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time. We design much of our own equipment and fabricate and upgrade such equipment in facilities that we operate. We also design and develop our own technology. If such equipment or technology fails to perform as expected, or if we fail to maintain or operate the equipment properly, there could be personal injuries, property damage, and environmental contamination, which could result in claims against us. Our ownership and use of proprietary technology and equipment could also result in infringement of intellectual property claims against us. See above Technology disputes and limitations on our ability to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could negatively impact our costs, revenues, and any competitive advantage we hold ." The Company also owns and operates a large fleet of motor vehicles, which creates an increased exposure to motor vehicle accidents. Also, we may be subject, and have been subject in the past, to litigation resulting from accidents involving motor vehicles. These lawsuits have resulted, and may result in the future, in the payment of substantial settlements or damages and increases in our insurance costs. In addition, during periods of depressed market conditions we may be subject to an increased risk of our customers, vendors, former employees and others initiating legal proceedings against us. Further, actions or decisions we have taken or may take as a consequence of COVID-19 may result in investigations, litigation or legal claims against us. Lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any litigation or claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future.

 Additional tax liabilities, limitations on our use of net operating losses and tax credits and/or our significant net deferred tax liability could affect our financial condition, income tax provision, net income, and cash flows. 
 
 We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly audited by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than what is reflected in income tax provisions and accruals. An audit or litigation could materially affect our financial position, income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods challenged. Tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries are organized and conduct their operations may change significantly as a result of political or economic factors beyond our control. It is also possible that future changes to tax laws (including tax treaties in any of the jurisdictions that we operate in) could impact our ability to realize the tax savings recorded to date. Our ability to benefit from our deferred tax assets depends on us having sufficient future taxable income to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before they expire. In addition, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended Section 382 ), generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating losses and other pre-change tax attributes (such as tax credits) that may be used to offset taxable income by a corporation that has undergone an ownership change (as determined under Section 382). An ownership change generally occurs if one or more shareholders (or groups of shareholders) that are each deemed to own at least 5 percent of our stock change their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage during a rolling three-year period. As of September 30, 2023, we have not experienced an ownership change and, therefore, utilization of our applicable tax attributes were not subject to an annual limitation (except for an immaterial portion thereof that we inherited in connection with an acquisition during 2017). However, if we were to experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, our ability to use certain pre-change tax attributes could potentially accelerate or permanently increase our future tax liabilities. Additionally, our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws (including tax treaties) or their interpretation. For example, the IRA, passed on August 16, 2022, included a 15 percent corporate minimum tax applicable to tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. We do not believe the corporate minimum tax will materially impact our effective tax rate or tax liability. Also, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD released Pillar Two model rules defining a 15 global minimum tax rate for large multinational corporations. The OECD continues to release additional guidance and countries are implementing legislation with widespread adoption of the Pillar Two Framework expected in the near future. We are in the process of evaluating the potential impacts of Pillar Two. While we do not currently expect Pillar Two to have a material impact on our effective tax rate, our analysis is ongoing and incomplete, and it is possible Pillar Two could have a material adverse effect on our tax liability. 
 Our deferred tax liability associated with property, plant and equipment is significant, which could materially increase the amount of cash income taxes that we pay in the future and, thus, adversely affect our cash flows. Our future capital expenditures, our results of operations and changes in income tax laws could significantly impact the timing of the reversal of our deferred tax liabilities and the timing and amount of our future cash income taxes. While management intends to minimize our income taxes payable in future years to the extent possible, the amount and timing of cash income taxes ultimately paid are based on the aforementioned factors as well as others and are subject to change. 
 Failure to comply with or changes to governmental and environmental laws could adversely affect our business. 
 
 Many aspects of our operations are subject to various laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate, including those relating to drilling practices and comprehensive and frequently changing laws and regulations relating to the safety and to the protection of human health and the environment. Environmental laws apply to the oil and gas industry including those regulating air emissions, discharges to water, and the transport, storage, use, treatment, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, solid and hazardous wastes and materials. These laws can have a material adverse effect on the drilling industry, including our operations, and compliance with such laws may require us to make significant capital expenditures, such as the installation of costly equipment or operational changes, and may affect the resale values or useful lives of our drilling rigs. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be exposed to substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, delays in permitting or performance of projects and, in some cases, injunctive relief. Violations of environmental laws may also result in liabilities for personal injuries, property and natural resource damage and other costs and claims. In addition, environmental laws and regulations in the United States impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages from such spills. As an owner and operator of drilling rigs, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under these laws and regulations. 
 Additional legislation or regulation and changes to existing legislation and regulation may reasonably be anticipated, and the effect thereof on our operations cannot be predicted. The expansion of the scope of laws or regulations protecting the environment has accelerated in recent years, particularly outside the United States, and we expect this trend to continue. To the extent new laws are enacted or other governmental actions are taken that prohibit or restrict drilling in areas where we operate or impose additional environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry, in general, or the drilling industry, in particular, our business or prospects could be materially adversely affected.

 RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK AND CORPORATE STRUCTURE 
 We may reduce or suspend our dividend in the future. 
 
 We have paid a quarterly dividend for many years and commencing in fiscal 2023 paid a quarterly supplemental dividend in addition to the established base dividend as part of a supplemental capital allocation plan. The supplemental capital allocation plan is refreshed on an annual basis and the supplemental dividends are proposed and approved on a quarterly basis with record and payment dates that coincide with the base dividends that are also proposed and approved on a quarterly basis. Our most recent quarterly base dividend declared was 0.25 per share. Subsequent to September 30, 2023, we also declared a supplemental quarterly dividend of 0.17 per share as part of our fiscal 2024 supplemental shareholder return plan announced in October 2023. In the future, our Board of Directors may, without advance notice, determine to reduce or suspend our dividends in order to maintain our financial flexibility and best position the Company for long term success. The declaration and amount of future dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, prospects, industry conditions, capital requirements and other factors and restrictions our Board of Directors deems relevant. The likelihood that dividends will be reduced or suspended is increased during periods of prolonged market weakness or uncertainty, such as the downturn as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the oil price collapse in 2020. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited by agreements governing our indebtedness now or in the future. There can be no assurance that we will not reduce our dividend or that we will continue to pay a dividend in the future. 
 The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, and investors may not be able to resell shares at or above the price paid. 
 
 The trading price of our common stock may be volatile. Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as other general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating or financial performance. The following factors, in addition to other factors described in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock: 
 changes in customer needs, expectations or trends and our ability to maintain relationships with key customers; 
 our ability to implement our business strategy; 
 changes in our capital structure, including the issuance of additional debt; 
 public announcements (including the timing of these announcements) regarding our business, financial performance and prospects or new products or services, product enhancements, technological advances or strategic actions, such as acquisitions, restructurings or significant contracts, by our competitors or us; 
 trading activity in our stock, including portfolio transactions in our stock by us, our executive officers and directors, and significant stockholders or trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which we may be included; 
 short-interest in our common stock, which could be significant from time to time; 
 our inclusion in, or removal from, any stock indices; 
 investor perception of us and the industry and markets in which we operate; 
 increased focus by the investment community on sustainability practices at our company and in the oil and natural gas industry generally; 
 changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by securities analysts; 
 whether or not we meet earnings estimates of securities analysts who follow us; 
 regulatory or legal developments in the United States and foreign countries where we operate; and 
 general financial, domestic, international, economic, and market conditions, including overall fluctuations in the U.S. equity markets.

 Certain provisions of our corporate governing documents could make an acquisition of our company more difficult. 
 
 The following provisions of our charter documents, as currently in effect, and Delaware law could discourage potential proposals to acquire us, delay or prevent a change in control of us or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock: 
 our certificate of incorporation permits our Board of Directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock and to adopt amendments to our bylaws; 
 our bylaws contain restrictions regarding the right of stockholders to nominate directors and to submit proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings; 
 our bylaws restrict the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and 
 we are subject to provisions of Delaware law which restrict us from engaging in any of a broad range of business transactions with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date such stockholder became classified as an interested stockholder. 
 The choice of forum provision in our bylaws could limit our stockholders ability to obtain what such stockholders believe to be a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees. 
 Our amended and restated bylaws provide that unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum (a) the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent arising out of or relating to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware the DGCL ), our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware. If the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction over any such action or proceeding, the sole and exclusive forum for such action or proceeding will be another state or federal court located within the State of Delaware; and (b) the sole and exclusive forum for any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act will be the federal district courts of the United States of America. This exclusive forum provision is not intended to apply to claims arising under the Exchange Act. While the Delaware Supreme Court has upheld the validity of similar provisions under the DGCL, there is uncertainty as to whether a court in another state would enforce such a forum selection provision. Our exclusive forum provision does not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations. 
 This choice of forum provision may subject a stockholder to increased costs to bring a claim and limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that he, she or it believes to be favorable for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers or other employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits. It is possible that a court could find these exclusive forum provisions inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, and we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and Board of Directors. 
 Public and investor sentiment towards climate change, fossil fuels and other ESG matters could adversely affect our cost of capital and the price of our common stock. 
 
 There have been efforts within the investment community (including investment advisors, investment fund managers, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and individual investors) to promote the divestment of, or limit investment in, the stock of companies in the oil and gas industry. There has also been pressure on lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail financing of companies in the oil and gas industry. Because we operate within the oil and gas industry, if these efforts continue or expand, our stock price and our ability to raise capital may be negatively impacted.

 Some members of the investment community have increased their focus on ESG practices and disclosures by public companies, including practices and disclosures related to climate change and sustainability, DE I initiatives, and heightened governance standards. As a result, we may continue to face pressure regarding our ESG disclosures and practices. See above " Our aspirations, goals and initiatives related to sustainability and emissions reduction, and our public statements and disclosures regarding them, expose us to numerous risks." Additionally, members of the investment community may screen companies such as ours for ESG disclosures and performance before investing in our stock and many large institutional investors have committed to allocating a percentage of their investment products towards ESG investments. With respect to any of these investors, our ESG disclosures and efforts may not satisfy the investor requirements or their requirements may not be made known to us. If we or our securities are unable to meet the ESG standards or investment criteria set by these investors and funds, we may lose investors or investors may allocate a portion of their capital away from us, our cost of capital may increase, and our stock price may be negatively impacted.

 Executive Summary 
 
 Helmerich Payne, Inc. H P, which, together with its subsidiaries, is identified as the Company, we, us, or our, except where stated or the context requires otherwise) through its operating subsidiaries provides performance-driven drilling solutions and technologies that are intended to make hydrocarbon recovery safer and more economical for oil and gas exploration and production companies. As of September 30, 2023, our drilling rig fleet included a total of 262 drilling rigs. Our reportable operating business segments consist of the North America Solutions segment with 233 rigs, the Offshore Gulf of Mexico segment with seven offshore platform rigs and the International Solutions segment with 22 rigs as of September 30, 2023. At the close of fiscal year 2023, we had 164 active contracted rigs, of which 91 were under a fixed-term contract and 73 were working well-to-well, compared to 192 contracted rigs at September 30, 2022. Our long-term strategy remains focused on innovation, technology, safety, operational excellence and reliability. As we move forward, we believe that our advanced uniform rig fleet, technology offerings, financial strength, contract backlog and strong customer and employee base position us very well to respond to continued cyclical and often times volatile market conditions and to take advantage of future opportunities. 
 2023 FORM 10-K | 37

 Market Outlook 
 
 Our revenues are primarily derived from the capital expenditures of companies involved in the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas E Ps ). Generally, the level of capital expenditures is dictated by capital budgets set to achieve respective production targets in relation to current and expected future prices of crude oil and natural gas, which are determined by various supply and demand factors. Both commodities have historically been, and we expect them to continue to be, cyclical and highly volatile. 
 Our drilling services operations are organized into the following reportable operating segments: North America Solutions, Offshore Gulf of Mexico, and International Solutions. With respect to North America Solutions, the resurgence of oil and natural gas production coming from the United States brought about by unconventional shale drilling for oil has significantly impacted the supply of oil and natural gas and the type of rig utilized in the U.S. land drilling industry. 
 The technical requirements of drilling longer lateral unconventional shale wells often necessitate the use of rigs that are commonly referred to in the industry as super-spec rigs and have the following specific characteristics: AC drive, minimum of 1,500 horsepower drawworks, minimum of 750,000 lbs. hookload rating, 7,500 psi mud circulating system, and multiple-well pad capability. 
 There is a strong customer preference for super-spec rigs not only due to the higher rig specifications that enable more technical drilling but also due to the drilling efficiencies gained in utilizing a super-spec rig. As a result, there has been a structural decline in the use of non-super-spec rigs across the industry. We are the largest provider of super-spec rigs in the industry and, accordingly, we believe we are well positioned to respond to various market conditions. 
 Historically there has been a strong correlation between crude oil and natural gas prices and the demand for drilling rigs with the rig count increasing and decreasing with the up and down movements in commodity prices. While that correlation remains for a segment of the market, beginning in 2021, a portion of rig activity has not moved in tandem with crude oil prices to the same extent as a large portion of our customers instituted a more disciplined approach to their operations and capital spending in order to enhance their own financial returns. Those customers established capital budgets based upon commodity price assumptions for the upcoming year and adhered to them, not adjusting activity plans as commodity prices moved. 
 The capital budgets for calendar year 2024 have not yet been established by many of our customers; however, based upon the crude oil and natural gas pricing environment and many of our customers' desire to at least maintain their current production levels, we expect the level of capital spending and activity in calendar year 2024 to be similar to that experienced in calendar year 2023. The overall demand for super-spec rigs in the U.S. remains relatively strong and while some readily available idle super-spec capacity exists in the market, it is not to a level that has materially impacted pricing as it could be quickly reabsorbed into the market. This supply-demand dynamic combined with the value proposition we provide our customers through our drilling expertise, high-quality FlexRig fleet, and automation technology is expected to result in an improvement in our underlying contract economics. 
 With regards to our North America Solutions segment, volatility in natural gas prices and the related reduced rig demand contributed to an increased level of rig releases in the market during the first half of calendar year 2023. During the second half of calendar year 2023, other non-commodity price related factors, such as customer capital budgets, drilling plans, productions levels and customer consolidations, also led some customers to release rigs as well. Heading into our fiscal year 2024, we expect our rig activity to increase modestly during the first half of the fiscal year as customers reset their capital budgets for 2024 and will likely remain at a relatively stable level during the back half of the fiscal year. This is similar to the rig activity patterns we have experienced during the last few years as well. During fiscal year 2023, the Company employed a fiscally prudent approach to deploying capital and prioritizing economic margins over rig utilization, and we plan to maintain this approach in fiscal 2024. Furthermore, we still believe the supply and demand dynamics surrounding our North America Solutions segment remain constructive for future activity and pricing levels. 
 Collectively, our other business segments, Offshore Gulf of Mexico and International Solutions, are exposed to the same macro commodity price environment affecting our North America Solutions segment; however, activity levels in the International Solutions segment are also subject to other various geopolitical and financial factors specific to the countries of our operations. During fiscal 2024, we plan to continue to devote capital to our international expansion strategy. While we understand this strategy will take time and capital to execute, we believe it is important in terms of growth and diversification for the Company. Currently, activity levels in the International Solutions and Offshore Gulf of Mexico business segments look to remain relatively steady at current levels for the foreseeable future.

 Over the past two years, the Company has experienced inflationary pressures related to labor and consumable inventory and more recently as a result of cost-acceleration related to running our rig fleet harder to achieve the well designs, lateral lengths and drilling efficiencies our customers demand. The inflationary forces have abated, and the financial impacts were partially mitigated by pass-through mechanisms in our contracts. However, the performance and efficiency gains we achieve require us to continue to push the service intensity of our rigs and equipment. Accordingly, we expect operational expenses to remain at elevated levels compared to recent years. Additionally, we are also experiencing inflationary pressures in our non-operational expenses particularly around labor and third-party services. As a consequence of these pressures, we are projecting an increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2024. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 
 Credit Facility Extension 
 On February 10, 2023, lenders with 680.0 million of commitments under the 2018 Credit Facility exercised their option to extend the maturity of the 2018 Credit Facility from November 11, 2026 to November 12, 2027. The remaining 70.0 million of commitments under the 2018 Credit Facility will expire on November 13, 2024, unless extended by the applicable lender before such date. 
 Investment in Tamboran 
 In October 2022, we made a 14.1 million equity investment, representing 106.0 million common shares in Tamboran Resources Limited, a publicly traded company on the Australian Securities Exchange Ltd under the ticker "TBN." Tamboran is focused on playing a constructive role in the global energy transition towards a lower carbon future, by developing a significantly low CO 2 gas resource within Australia's Beetaloo Sub-basin. During the year ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a loss of 4.2 million, recorded within Gain (loss) on investment securities on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, as a result of the change in fair value of the investment during the period. Concurrent with the investment agreement, we entered into a fixed-term drilling services agreement with Tamboran. During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2023, drilling services commenced. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Related Risks and Uncertainties to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional related party disclosures. 
 Significant Lease Commenced 
 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we entered into a lease agreement to relocate our Tulsa corporate headquarters to a new office space. This lease commenced during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2023 and resulted in a 17.6 million increase to right-of-use assets and lease liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, we began amortizing the right of use asset over the initial lease term of approximately 12 years. 
 
 Contract Backlog 
 Drilling contract backlog is the expected future dayrate revenue from executed contracts. We calculate backlog as the total expected revenue from fixed-term contracts and do not include any anticipated contract renewals or expected performance bonuses as part of its calculation. Additionally, contracts that currently contain month-to-month terms are represented in our backlog as one month of unsatisfied performance obligations. In addition to depicting the total expected revenue from fixed-term contracts, backlog is indicative of expected future cash flow that the Company expects to receive regardless of whether a customer honors the fixed-term contract to expiration of a contract or decides to terminate the contract early and pay an early termination payment. In the event of an early termination payment, the timing of the recognition of backlog and the total amount of revenue may differ; however, the overall associated gross margin is preserved. As such, management finds backlog a useful metric for future planning and budgeting, whereas investors consider it useful in estimating future revenue and cash flows of the Company. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, our contract drilling backlog was 1.4 billion and 1.2 billion, respectively. The increase in backlog at September 30, 2023 from 2022 is primarily due to an increase in the number of contracts executed under FlexPool agreements. Approximately 33.8 percent of the September 30, 2023 total backlog is reasonably expected to be fulfilled in fiscal year 2025 and thereafter.

 The early termination of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In some limited circumstances, such as sustained unacceptable performance by us, no early termination payment would be paid to us. Early terminations could cause the actual amount of revenue earned to vary from the backlog reported. See Item 1A "Risk Factors Our current backlog of drilling services and solutions revenue may decline and may not be ultimately realized as fixed term contracts and may, in certain instances, be terminated without an early termination payment within this Form 10-K regarding fixed term contract risk. Additionally, see Item 1A "Risk Factors The impact and effects of public health crises, pandemics and epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations" within this Form 10-K. 
 
 Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 
 
 Consolidated Results of Operations 
 Net Income We recorded net income of 434.1 million 4.16 per diluted share) for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to net income of 7.0 million 0.05 per diluted share) for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. 
 Operating Revenue Consolidated operating revenues were 2.9 billion and 2.1 billion during fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The 0.8 billion increase in fiscal year 2023 from fiscal year 2022 was primarily driven by an increase in average rig pricing and activity levels in our North America Solutions segment and increased activity levels in our International Solutions segment. Refer to segment results below for further details. 
 Direct Operating Expenses, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization Direct operating expenses in fiscal year 2023 were 1.7 billion, compared to direct operating expenses of 1.4 billion in fiscal year 2022. The increase in fiscal year 2023 from fiscal year 2022 was primarily attributable to the previously mentioned higher activity levels as well as a North America Solutions wage increase that became effective at the end of fiscal year 2022. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense was 382.3 million in fiscal year 2023 and 403.2 million in fiscal year 2022. The decrease is reflective of lower capital expenditures over the last several years. Depreciation and amortization includes amortization of intangible assets of 6.6 million and 7.2 million in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, and abandonments of equipment of 3.3 million and 6.6 million in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 206.7 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 compared to 182.4 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. The 24.3 million increase in fiscal year 2023 is primarily due to an increase in professional fees of 12.0 million and an increase in labor and labor-related expenses of 8.6 million. 
 Asset Impairment Charges During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Company initiated a plan to decommission, scrap and/or sell certain assets including four international FlexRig drilling rigs, four international conventional drilling rigs, and additional equipment. The aggregate net book value of these assets of 13.2 million was written down to their estimated scrap value of 1.1 million, resulting in non-cash impairment charges of 12.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, of which 8.1 million of the charge is recorded within the International Solutions segment. The remaining 4.0 million is recorded within the North America Solutions segment. The impairment charge was recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. Comparatively, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we identified various assets that met the asset held-for-sale criteria and were reclassified as assets held-for-sale within our North America Solutions and International Solutions segments, which resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of 4.4 million, of which 2.5 million of the charge is recorded within the International Solutions segment. The remaining 1.9 million is recorded within the North America Solutions segment. The impairment charge was recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.

 Gain on Investment Securities During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we recognized an aggregate gain of 11.3 million on investment securities. This gain was mainly comprised of a 27.4 million gain on our equity investment in ADNOC Drilling, partially offset against a 4.2 million loss on our investment in Tamboran; both of which were a result of fluctuations in the fair market value of the stocks. Additionally, the aggregate gain was offset by a 12.2 million loss on investment recognized during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 as a result of a Blue Chip Swap transaction that occurred during the period. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Related Risks and Uncertainties International Solutions Drilling Risks for additional information related to the Blue Chip Swap. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we recognized an aggregate gain of 57.9 million on investment securities. This gain was mainly comprised of a 47.4 million gain on our equity investment in ADNOC Drilling, caused by an increase in the fair market value of the stock, and a gain of 8.2 million on the sale of our equity investment in Schlumberger, Ltd. 
 Interest and Dividend Income Interest and dividend income was 28.4 million and 18.1 million in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in interest and dividend income in fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to higher market interest rates. 
 Interest Expense Interest expense totaled 17.3 million in fiscal year 2023 and 19.2 million in fiscal year 2022. The decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to the fiscal year 2022 interest expense associated with our 4.65 Senior Notes due 2025 which were redeemed on October 27, 2021. 
 Income Taxes We had an income tax expense of 159.3 million in fiscal year 2023 compared to an income tax expense of 24.4 million in fiscal year 2022. The effective income tax rate was 26.8 percent in fiscal year 2023 compared to 77.8 percent in fiscal year 2022. The effective rates differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate (21.0 percent for the fiscal years 2023 and 2022) primarily due to non-deductible permanent items, the foreign derived intangible income deduction (in fiscal year 2022), state and foreign income taxes, and adjustments to the deferred state income tax rate. Additionally, the effective income tax rate is higher in fiscal year 2022 as the low level of net income before tax increases the impact of the rate differences. 
 Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. Recoverability of any tax assets are evaluated and necessary allowances are provided. The carrying values of the net deferred tax assets are based on management s judgments using certain estimates and assumptions that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the benefits of such assets. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, additional valuation allowances may be recorded against the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the future. See Note 7 Income Taxes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional income tax disclosures.

 Operating Revenues Operating revenues were 2.5 billion and 1.8 billion in fiscal year 2023 and 2022, respectively. Operating revenues increased 0.7 billion in fiscal year 2023 primarily due to higher pricing and a 3.6 percent increase in activity levels. 
 Direct Operating Expenses Direct operating expenses increased to 1.4 billion during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to 1.2 billion during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily driven by an increase of 137.3 million in labor and labor-related expenses driven by higher activity levels and increased field wages beginning in late September 2022. Additionally, materials and supplies expense increased by 19.3 million, which was also primarily driven by higher activity levels. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to 354.0 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to 375.3 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. The decrease is reflective of lower capital expenditures over the last several years. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 58.4 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to 43.8 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. This increase was largely driven by a 10.8 million increase in professional services fees.

 Operating Revenues Operating revenues were 130.2 million and 125.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The 3.8 percent increase in operating revenue was largely driven by pricing increases and wage increase pass-throughs which occurred in the latter portion of fiscal year 2022 partially offset by the mix of rigs being on lower standby or mobilization rates as opposed to working at full rates. 
 Direct Operating Expenses Direct operating expenses increased to 96.8 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to 90.4 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by the factors described above.

 Operating Revenues Operating revenues were 212.6 million and 136.1 million in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The 76.5 million increase in fiscal year 2023 from fiscal year 2022 was primarily driven by a 57.7 percent increase in activity levels. Additionally, during the year ended September 30, 2022, we recognized 16.4 million in revenue related to the settlement of a contract drilling dispute related to drilling services provided from fiscal year 2016 through 2019 with YPF S.A. Refer to Note 9 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers for additional details. 
 Operating Expenses Direct operating expenses increased to 187.3 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to 120.8 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily driven by an increase of 33.3 million in labor and labor-related expense and an increase of 17.6 million in materials and supplies as a result of higher activity levels. 
 Asset Impairment Charges During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Company initiated a plan to decommission and scrap four international FlexRig drilling rigs and four conventional drilling rigs located in Argentina that are not suitable for unconventional drilling. As a result, these rigs were reclassified to Assets held-for-sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The rigs aggregate net book value of 8.8 million was written down to the estimated scrap value of 0.7 million, which resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of 8.1 million recorded in Asset impairment charges within our Consolidated Statement of Operations during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we identified two international FlexRig drilling rigs that met the asset held-for-sale criteria and were reclassified to Assets held-for-sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. This resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of 2.5 million recorded in Asset impairment charges within our Consolidated Statement of Operations during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, as the rigs aggregate net book value of 3.4 million exceeded the fair value of the rigs less estimated cost to sell of 0.9 million.

 Other Operations 
 Results of our other operations, excluding corporate selling, general and administrative costs, and corporate depreciation, are as follows: 
 (in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Operating revenues 77,296 66,287 16.6 Direct operating expenses 57,944 50,683 14.3 Depreciation 2,014 1,701 18.4 Selling, general and administrative expense 1,462 1,183 23.6 Operating income 15,876 12,720 24.8 
 Operating Revenues We continue to use our Captive insurance companies to insure the deductibles for our domestic workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability claims programs, and medical stop-loss program and to insure the deductibles from the Company's international casualty and rig property programs. Intercompany premium revenues recorded by the Captives during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 amounted to 67.4 million and 57.0 million, respectively, which were eliminated upon consolidation. 
 Direct Operating Expenses Direct operating expenses consisted primarily of 12.5 million and 7.0 million in adjustments to accruals for estimated losses allocated to the Captives and rig and casualty insurance premiums of 39.7 million and 35.6 million during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The change to accruals for estimated losses is primarily due to actuarial valuation adjustments by our third-party actuary. 
 Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 
 
 A discussion of our results of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 is included in Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on November 16, 2022 . 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 Our sources of available liquidity include existing cash balances on hand, cash flows from operations, and availability under the 2018 Credit Facility. Our liquidity requirements include meeting ongoing working capital needs, funding our capital expenditure projects, paying dividends declared, and repaying our outstanding indebtedness. Historically, we have financed operations primarily through internally generated cash flows. During periods when internally generated cash flows are not sufficient to meet liquidity needs, we may utilize cash on hand, borrow from available credit sources, access capital markets or sell our investments. Likewise, if we are generating excess cash flows or have cash balances on hand beyond our near-term needs, we may return cash to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases, or we may invest in highly rated short-term money market and debt securities. These investments can include U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Agency issued debt securities, highly rated corporate bonds and commercial paper, certificates of deposit and money market funds. However, in some international locations we may make short-term investments that are less conservative, as equivalent highly rated investments are unavailable. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Related Risks and Uncertainties International Solutions Drilling Risks. 
 We may seek to access the debt and equity capital markets from time to time to raise additional capital, increase liquidity as necessary, fund our additional purchases, exchange or redeem senior notes, or repay any amounts under the 2018 Credit Facility. Our ability to access the debt and equity capital markets depends on a number of factors, including our credit rating, market and industry conditions and market perceptions of our industry, general economic conditions, our revenue backlog and our capital expenditure commitments. 
 Cash Flows 
 Our cash flows fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including, among others, the number of our drilling rigs under contract, the revenue we receive under those contracts, the efficiency with which we operate our drilling rigs, the timing of collections on outstanding accounts receivable, the timing of payments to our vendors for operating costs, and capital expenditures. As our revenues increase, operating net working capital is typically a use of capital, while conversely, as our revenues decrease, operating net working capital is typically a source of capital. To date, general inflationary trends have not had a material effect on our operating margins or cash flows as we have been able to offset these cumulative cost trends with rate increases.

 As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of 257.2 million and 232.1 million and short-term investments of 93.6 million and 117.1 million, respectively. Our cash flows for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are presented below: 
 Year Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2023 2022 2021 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 833,682 233,913 136,440 Investing activities (322,584) (167,315) (161,994) Financing activities (463,869) (734,305) 425,523 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 47,229 (667,707) 399,969 
 Operating Activities 
 Our operating net working capital (non-GAAP) as of September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 is presented below: 
 Year Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2023 2022 2021 Total current assets 1,006,625 1,002,944 1,586,566 Less: Cash and cash equivalents 257,174 232,131 917,534 Short-term investments 93,600 117,101 198,700 Assets held-for-sale 645 4,333 71,453 Prepaid property, plant and equipment 21,821 10,091 633,385 639,288 398,879 Total current liabilities 418,931 394,810 866,306 Less: Dividends payable 25,194 26,693 27,332 Current portion of long-term debt, net 483,486 Advance payment for sale of property, plant and equipment 600 86,524 393,737 367,517 268,964 Operating net working capital (non-GAAP) 239,648 271,771 129,915 
 Cash flows provided by operating activities were approximately 833.7 million, 233.9 million, and 136.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities between fiscal years 2023 and 2022 is primarily driven by higher activity and pricing. The increase in cash provided by operating activities between fiscal years 2022 and 2021 was primarily driven by higher activity and pricing, and is partially offset by changes in operating net working capital. For the purpose of understanding the impact on our cash flows from operating activities, operating net working capital is calculated as current assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, assets held-for-sale, and prepaid property, plant and equipment, less current liabilities, excluding dividends payable, short-term debt and advance payments for sale of property, plant and equipment. 
 Operating net working capital was 239.6 million, 271.8 million and 129.9 million as of September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This metric is considered a non-GAAP measure of the Company's liquidity. The Company considers operating net working capital to be a supplemental measure for presenting and analyzing trends in our cash flows from operations over time. Likewise, the Company believes that operating net working capital is useful to investors because it provides a means to evaluate the operating performance of the business using criteria that are used by our internal decision makers. 
 Investing Activities 
 Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditures were 395.5 million, 250.9 million and 82.1 million in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures is largely driven by higher activity levels and increased costs associated with rig upgrades, including walking rig conversions. Our fiscal year 2024 capital spending is currently estimated to be between 450 million and 500 million. This estimate includes normal capital maintenance requirements, information technology spending, and skidding to walking conversions for up to 14 rigs.

 Net Purchases Sales of Short-Term Investments Our net sales of short-term investments during fiscal year 2023 were 14.3 million compared to net sales of 79.6 million and net purchases 107.4 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The change in activity is driven by our ongoing liquidity management. Additionally, the Central Bank of Argentina maintains currency controls that limit our ability to access U.S. dollars in Argentina and remit cash from our Argentine operations. The execution of certain trades known as Blue Chip Swaps effectively results in a parallel U.S. dollar exchange rate. During the fiscal year ended 2023, we entered into a Blue Chip Swap transaction, which resulted in a 12.2 million loss on investment recorded in Gain on investment securities within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As a result of the Blue Chip Swap transaction, 9.8 million of net cash was repatriated to the U.S. during the period. 
 Net Purchases of Long-Term Investments Our net purchases of long-term investments were 20.7 million, 29.2 million and 102.5 million in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, our activity was primarily driven by a 14.1 million equity investment in Tamboran Resources Limited, 4.1 million in debt and equity security investments in various geothermal energy companies, and 2.5 million investments in other equity securities. The decrease in net purchases between fiscal years 2022 and 2021 is primarily driven by our 100.0 million cornerstone investment in ADNOC Drilling purchased during fiscal year 2021, the 22.0 million of proceeds received from the liquidation of our remaining equity securities in Schlumberger, Ltd, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, offset by the purchase of a 33.0 million cornerstone investment in a convertible note in Galileo Holdco 2 and the purchase of 18.2 million in various geothermal investments during fiscal year 2022. 
 Sale of Assets Our proceeds from asset sales totaled 70.1 million, 62.3 million and 43.5 million in fiscal year 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in proceeds is largely driven by higher rig activity which drives higher reimbursement from customers for lost or damaged drill pipe and other used drilling equipment. Additionally, in fiscal year 2022, we sold our casing running and trucking assets. 
 Insurance Proceeds from Involuntary Conversion I n November 2022, a fire at a wellsite caused substantial damage to one of our super spec-rigs within our North America Solutions segment. The major components were destroyed beyond repair and considered a total loss, and, as a result, these assets were written off and the rig was removed from our available rig count. At the time of the loss, the rig was fully insured under replacement cost insurance. The insurance recovery is expected to exceed the net book value of the components written off. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we collected 9.2 million of the total expected insurance proceeds. 
 Advance Payment for Sale of Property, Plant and Equipment During September 2021, the Company agreed to sell eight FlexRig land rigs with an aggregate net book value of 55.6 million to ADNOC Drilling for 86.5 million. We received 86.5 million in cash consideration in advance of delivering the rigs. 
 Financing Activities 
 Repurchase of Shares The Company has an evergreen authorization from the Board of Directors for the repurchase of up to four million common shares in any calendar year. In December 2022, the Board of Directors increased the maximum number of shares authorized to be repurchased in calendar year 2023 to five million common shares. On June 7, 2023, the Board of Directors further increased the maximum number of shares authorized to be repurchased in calendar year 2023 to seven million shares. The repurchases may be made using our cash and cash equivalents or other available sources and are held as treasury shares on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased 6.5 million common shares at an aggregate cost of 249.0 million, including accrued excise tax of 1.8 million, resulting in a net cash outflow of 247.2 million. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we repurchased 3.2 million common shares at an aggregate cost of 77.0 million. There were no purchases of common shares in fiscal year 2021. 
 Dividends We paid dividends of 1.94 per share, comprised of a base cash dividend of 1.00 and a supplemental cash dividend of 0.94 during the fiscal year 2023. Comparatively, we paid dividends of 1.00 per share in 2022 and 2021. Total dividends paid were 201.5 million, 107.4 million and 109.1 million in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Debt Issuance Proceeds and Costs On September 29, 2021, we issued 548.7 million aggregate principal amount of the 2031 Notes in an offering to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in the United States pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act Rule 144A and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act Regulation S ). Debt issuance fees paid as of September 30, 2021 were 3.9 million. 
 Redemption of 4.65 Senior Notes due 2025 On October 27, 2021, we redeemed all of the outstanding 2025 Notes, resulting in a cash outflow of 487.1 million. As a result, the associated make-whole premium of 56.4 million was paid during the first fiscal quarter of 2022 contemporaneously with the October 27, 2021 debt extinguishment. The Company financed the redemption of the 2025 Notes with the net proceeds from the offering of the 2031 Notes, together with cash on hand. Additional details are fully discussed in Note 6 Debt. 
 2023 FORM 10-K | 47 

Table of Contents 

 Senior Notes 
 2.90 Senior Notes due 2031 On September 29, 2021, we issued 550.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2.90 percent 2031 Notes in an offering to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in the United States pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act Rule 144A and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act Regulation S ). Interest on the 2031 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 29 and September 29 of each year, commencing on March 29, 2022. 
 In June 2022, we settled a registered exchange offer (the Registered Exchange Offer to exchange the 2031 Notes for new, SEC-registered notes that are substantially identical to the terms of the 2031 Notes, except that the offer and issuance of the new notes have been registered under the Securities Act and certain transfer restrictions, registration rights and additional interest provisions relating to the 2031 Notes do not apply to the new notes. All of the 2031 Notes were exchanged in the Registered Exchange Offer. 
 The indenture governing the 2031 Notes contains certain covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur certain liens; engage in sale and lease-back transactions; and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of the Company. The indenture governing the 2031 Notes also contains customary events of default with respect to the 2031 Notes. 
 4.65 Senior Notes due 2025 On December 20, 2018, we issued approximately 487.1 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes. The debt issuance cost were being amortized straight-line over the stated life of the obligation, which approximated the effective interest method. 
 On September 27, 2021, the Company delivered a conditional notice of optional full redemption for all of the outstanding 2025 Notes at a redemption price calculated in accordance with the indenture governing the 2025 Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2025 Notes to be redeemed. The Company financed the redemption of the 2025 Notes with the net proceeds from the offering of the 2031 Notes, together with cash on hand. The Company s obligation to redeem the 2025 Notes was conditioned upon the prior consummation of the issuance of the 2031 Notes, which was satisfied on September 29, 2021. 
 On October 27, 2021, we redeemed all of the outstanding 2025 Notes. As a result, the associated make-whole premium of 56.4 million and the write off of the unamortized discount and debt issuance costs of 3.7 million were recognized during the first fiscal quarter of 2022 contemporaneously with the October 27, 2021 debt extinguishment and recorded in Loss on extinguishment of debt on our Consolidated Statements of Operations during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. 
 Credit Facility 
 On November 13, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement by and among the Company, as borrower, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto, which was amended on November 13, 2019, providing for an unsecured revolving credit facility (as amended, the 2018 Credit Facility ), that was set to mature on November 13, 2024. On April 16, 2021, lenders with 680.0 million of commitments under the 2018 Credit Facility exercised their option to extend the maturity of the 2018 Credit Facility from November 13, 2024 to November 12, 2025. No other terms of the 2018 Credit Facility were amended in connection with this extension. On March 8, 2022, we entered into the second amendment to the 2018 Credit Facility, which, among other things, raised the number of potential future extensions of the maturity date applicable to extending lenders from one to two such potential extensions and replaced provisions in respect of interest rate determinations that were based on the London Interbank Offered Rate with provisions based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. Additionally, lenders with 680.0 million of commitments under the 2018 Credit Facility exercised their option to extend the maturity of the 2018 Credit Facility from November 12, 2025 to November 11, 2026. On February 10, 2023, lenders with 680.0 million of commitments under the 2018 Credit Facility exercised their option to extend the maturity of the 2018 Credit Facility from November 11, 2026 to November 12, 2027. The remaining 70.0 million of commitments under the 2018 Credit Facility will expire on November 13, 2024, unless extended by the applicable lender before such date. 
 The 2018 Credit Facility has 750.0 million in aggregate availability with a maximum of 75.0 million available for use as letters of credit. As of September 30, 2023, there were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding, leaving 750.0 million available to borrow under the 2018 Credit Facility. For a full description of the 2018 Credit Facility, see Note 6 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 As of September 30, 2023, we had 95.0 million in uncommitted bilateral credit facilities, for the purpose of obtaining the issuance of international letters of credit, bank guarantees, and performance bonds. Of the 95.0 million, 40.0 million was outstanding as of September 30, 2023. Separately, we had 2.1 million in standby letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding. In total, we had 42.1 million outstanding as of September 30, 2023. 
 The applicable agreements for all unsecured debt contain additional terms, conditions and restrictions that we believe are usual and customary in unsecured debt arrangements for companies that are similar in size and credit quality. At September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.

 Future Cash Requirements 
 Our operating cash requirements, scheduled debt repayments, interest payments, any declared dividends, and estimated capital expenditures for fiscal year 2024 are expected to be funded through current cash and cash to be provided from operating activities. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at current levels. If needed, we may decide to obtain additional funding from our 750.0 million 2018 Credit Facility. We currently do not anticipate the need to draw on the 2018 Credit Facility. Our indebtedness under our unsecured senior notes totaled 550.0 million at September 30, 2023 and matures on September 29, 2031. 
 As of September 30, 2023, we had a 517.8 million deferred tax liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, primarily related to temporary differences between the financial and income tax basis of property, plant and equipment. Our capital expenditures over the last several years have been subject to accelerated depreciation methods (including bonus depreciation) available under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, enabling us to defer a portion of cash tax payments to future years. Future levels of capital expenditures and results of operations will determine the timing and amount of future cash tax payments. We expect to be able to meet any such obligations utilizing cash and investments on hand, as well as cash generated from ongoing operations. 
 At September 30, 2023, we have recorded approximately 3.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits, interest, and penalties. We believe it is reasonably possible up to 2.6 million of the unrecognized tax benefits, interest, and penalties will be recognized as of June 30, 2024 as a result of a lapse of the statute of limitations. Any further reversals or payments of the liability cannot be estimated at this time. 
 The long term debt to total capitalization ratio was 16.6 percent as of September 30, 2023 and 2022. For additional information regarding debt agreements, refer to Note 6 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 There were no other significant changes in our financial position since September 30, 2022.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Accounting policies that we consider significant are summarized in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Related Risks and Uncertainties to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. These estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates used in our financial statements. 
 2023 FORM 10-K | 49 

Table of Contents 

 Property, Plant and Equipment 
 Property, plant and equipment, including renewals and betterments, are capitalized at cost, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. We account for the depreciation of property, plant and equipment using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets considering the estimated salvage value of the property, plant and equipment. Both the estimated useful lives and salvage values require the use of management estimates. Assets held-for-sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Our estimate of fair value represents our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market transactions and is subject to variability. Certain events, such as unforeseen changes in operations, technology or market conditions, could materially affect our estimates and assumptions related to depreciation or result in abandonments. For the fiscal years presented in this Form 10-K, no significant changes were made to the determinations of useful lives or salvage values. Upon retirement or other disposal of fixed assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any gains or losses are recorded in the results of operations. 
 Impairment of Long lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
 Management assesses the potential impairment of our long lived assets and finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Changes that could prompt such an assessment may include equipment obsolescence, changes in the market demand, periods of relatively low rig utilization, declining revenue per day, declining cash margin per day, completion of specific contracts, change in technology and/or overall changes in general market conditions. If a review of the long lived assets and finite-lived intangibles indicates that the carrying value of certain of these assets or asset groups is more than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is made, as required, to adjust the carrying value to the estimated fair value. Cash flows are estimated by management considering factors such as prospective market demand, recent changes in rig technology and its effect on each rig s marketability, any cash investment required to make a rig marketable, suitability of rig size and makeup to existing platforms, and competitive dynamics including utilization. The fair value of drilling rigs is determined based upon either an income approach using estimated discounted future cash flows, a market approach considering factors such as recent market sales of rigs of other companies and our own sales of rigs, appraisals and other factors, a cost approach utilizing new reproduction costs adjusted for the asset age and condition, and/or a combination of multiple approaches. The use of different assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of assets and could therefore affect any impairment measurement. 
 We review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of the reporting unit holding such goodwill may exceed its fair value. We initially assess goodwill for impairment based on qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one of our reporting units is greater than its carrying amount. 
 If further testing is necessary or a quantitative test is elected, we quantitatively compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 
 Self Insurance Accruals 
 We insure working land rigs and related equipment at values that approximate the current replacement costs on the inception date of the policies. However, we self-insure large deductibles under these policies. We also carry insurance with varying deductibles and coverage limits with respect to stacked rigs, offshore platform rigs, and named wind storm risk in the Gulf of Mexico. We self insure a number of other risks, including loss of earnings and business interruption. 
 We self insure a significant portion of expected losses relating to workers compensation, general liability, employer s liability, auto liability, as well as other insurance coverages. Generally, deductibles range from 1 million to 10 million per occurrence depending on the coverage and whether a claim occurs outside or inside of the United States. Insurance is purchased over deductibles to reduce our exposure to catastrophic events but there can be no assurance that such coverage will apply or be adequate in all circumstances. Estimates are recorded for incurred outstanding liabilities for workers compensation and other casualty claims. Retained losses are estimated and accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred. Estimates for liabilities and retained losses are based on adjusters estimates, our historical loss experience and statistical methods commonly used within the insurance industry that we believe are reliable. 
 We also engage a third-party actuary to perform a periodic review of our casualty losses. Nonetheless, insurance estimates include certain assumptions and management judgments regarding the frequency and severity of claims, claim development and settlement practices. Unanticipated changes in these factors may produce materially different amounts of expense that would be reported under these programs. Our wholly owned captive insurance companies finance a significant portion of the physical damage risk on company owned drilling rigs as well as casualty deductibles. An actuary reviews the loss reserves retained by the Company and the captives on an annual basis.

 Revenue Recognition 
 Drilling services revenues are primarily comprised of daywork drilling contracts for which the related revenues and expenses are recognized as services are performed and collection is reasonably assured. With most drilling contracts, we receive payments contractually designated for the mobilization and demobilization of drilling rigs and other equipment to and from the client s drill site. Revenue associated with the mobilization and demobilization of our drilling rigs to and from the client s drill site do not relate to a distinct good or service. These revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the related contract term that drilling services are provided. The amount of demobilization revenue that we ultimately collect is dependent upon the specific contractual terms, most of which include provisions for reduced or no payment for demobilization when, among other things, the contract is renewed or extended with the same client, or when the rig is subsequently contracted with another client prior to the termination of the current contract. Since revenues associated with demobilization activity are typically variable, at each period end, they are estimated at the most likely amount, and constrained when the likelihood of a significant reversal is probable. Direct costs incurred for the mobilization, are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis as the drilling service is provided. While costs incurred to relocate rigs and other drilling equipment to areas in which a contract has not been secured are expensed as incurred. 
 We also act as a principal for certain reimbursable services and auxiliary equipment provided by us to our clients, for which we incur costs and earn revenues. Many of these costs are variable, or dependent upon the activity that is performed each day under the related contract. Accordingly, reimbursements that we receive for out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as revenues and the out-of-pocket expenses for which they relate are recorded as operating costs during the period to which they relate within the series of distinct time increments. For contracts that are terminated prior to the specified term, early termination payments received by us are recognized as revenues when all contractual requirements are met. 
 Income Taxes 
 Deferred income taxes are accounted for under the liability method, which takes into account the differences between the basis of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes. Our net deferred tax liability balance at year-end reflects the application of our income tax accounting policies and is based on management s estimates, judgments and assumptions. Included in our net deferred tax liability balance are deferred tax assets that are assessed for realizability. If it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in a future period, the deferred tax assets will be reduced by a valuation allowance based on management s estimates. 
 In addition, we operate in several countries throughout the world and our tax returns filed in those jurisdictions are subject to review and examination by tax authorities within those jurisdictions. We recognize uncertain tax positions we believe have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained. We cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any existing or future assessments. 
 
 New Accounting Standards 
 
 See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Related Risks and Uncertainties to our Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting standards and new accounting standards not yet adopted. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measurements 
 
 Direct Margin 
 Direct margin is considered a non-GAAP metric. We define "Direct margin" as operating revenues less direct operating expenses. Direct margin is included as a supplemental disclosure because we believe it is useful in assessing and understanding our current operational performance, especially in making comparisons over time. Direct margin is not a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should therefore be considered only as supplemental to such GAAP financial measures. 
 2023 FORM 10-K | 51

 The following table reconciles direct margin to segment operating income (loss), which we believe is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that is most directly comparable to direct margin.

 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Our financial position is exposed to a variety of risks, including foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk, credit and capital market risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 Our drilling contracts in foreign countries generally provide for payment in U.S. dollars. Historically, in Argentina, while the contracts were denominated in the U.S. dollar, we were paid in Argentine pesos. The Argentine branch of one of our second-tier subsidiaries remits U.S. dollars to its U.S. parent by converting the Argentine pesos into U.S. dollars through the Argentine Foreign Exchange Market and repatriating the U.S. dollars. In the future, other contracts or applicable law may require payments to be made in foreign currencies. As such, there can be no assurance that we will not experience in Argentina or elsewhere a devaluation of foreign currency, foreign exchange restrictions or other difficulties repatriating U.S. dollars even if we are able to negotiate the contract provisions designed to mitigate such risks. At September 30, 2023, a hypothetical decrease in value of 10 percent would result in a decrease in value of our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Argentine pesos by approximately 0.4 million. 
 Argentina s economy is currently considered highly inflationary, which is defined as cumulative inflation rates exceeding 100 percent in the most recent three year period based on inflation data published by the respective governments. Nonetheless, all of our foreign operations use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency and local currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars with gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions included in current results of operations. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 The demand for drilling services and solutions is derived from exploration and production companies spending money to explore and develop drilling prospects in search of crude oil and natural gas. Their spending is driven by their cash flow and financial strength, which is affected by trends in crude oil and natural gas commodity prices. Crude oil prices are determined by a number of factors including global supply and demand, the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries, worldwide economic conditions and geopolitical factors. Crude oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile and very difficult to predict with any degree of certainty. While current energy prices are important contributors to positive cash flow for customers, expectations about future prices and price volatility are generally more important for determining future spending levels. This volatility can lead many exploration and production companies to base their capital spending on much more conservative estimates of commodity prices. As a result, demand for drilling services and solutions is not always purely a function of the movement of commodity prices. 
 2023 FORM 10-K | 52 

Table of Contents 

 Credit and Capital Market Risk 
 Customers may finance their exploration activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. Any deterioration in the credit and capital markets, as experienced in the past, can make it difficult for customers to obtain funding for their capital needs. A reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices or a reduction of available financing may result in customer credit defaults or reduced demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, we may need to access capital markets to obtain financing. Our ability to access capital markets for financing could be limited by, among other things, oil and gas prices, our existing capital structure, our credit ratings, the state of the economy, the health of the drilling and overall oil and gas industry, and the liquidity of the capital markets. Many of the factors that affect our ability to access capital markets are outside of our control. No assurance can be given that we will be able to access capital markets on terms acceptable to us when required to do so, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Further, we attempt to secure favorable prices through advanced ordering and purchasing for drilling rig components. While these materials have generally been available at acceptable prices, there is no assurance the prices will not vary significantly in the future. Any fluctuations in market conditions causing increased prices in materials and supplies could have a material adverse effect on future operating costs. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our interest rate risk exposure results primarily from short term rates, mainly SOFR based, on any borrowings from our revolving credit facility. There were no outstanding borrowings under this facility at September 30, 2023, and our outstanding debt consisted of 550.0 million (face amount) in senior unsecured notes, which have a fixed rate of 2.90 percent and an estimated fair value of 435.5 million and 430.7 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
 Equity Price Risk 
 As of September 30, 2023, we had equity securities in Tamboran with a total fair value of 9.9 million. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022 we had equity securities in ADNOC Drilling with a total fair value of 174.8 million and 147.4 million, respectively. Our investment in ADNOC Drilling is subject to a three-year lockup period. We have applied the guidance in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, in the initial accounting of the transaction and the subsequent revaluation of the investment balance, concluding that the contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security that is publicly traded is not considered in measuring fair value. 
 A hypothetical 10 percent decrease in the market price for our marketable equity securities as of September 30, 2023 would decrease the fair value by 18.5 million. These securities are subject to a wide variety and number of market related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings. 
 At November 1, 2023, the total fair value of our equity securities decreased to approximately 174.0 million. We continually monitor the fair value of the investments but are unable to predict future market volatility and any potential impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Management of Helmerich Payne, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a 15(f) or 15d 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting was designed under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and includes those policies and procedures that: 
 (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 
 (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and the Board of Directors; and 
 (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in the Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) , management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. 
 , an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, as stated in their report which appears herein.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Helmerich Payne, Inc. 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Helmerich Payne, Inc. (the Company) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 8, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Self-Insurance Accruals 
 Description of the Matter 
 The Company's self-insurance liability for workers compensation and other casualty claims was 77.3 million at September 30, 2023. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, this liability is based on a third-party actuarial analysis, which includes an estimate for incurred but not reported claims. The actuarial analysis considers a variety of factors, including third-party adjusters estimates, historic experience, and statistical methods commonly used within the insurance industry. 
 
 Auditing the Company's reserve for self-insured risks for worker s compensation and other casualty claims is complex and required us to use our actuarial specialists due to the significant measurement uncertainty associated with the estimate, management s application of significant judgment, and the use of various actuarial methods.

 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 
 We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company s controls over the workers compensation and other casualty claims accrual process, including management s review controls over the significant assumptions used in the calculation and the completeness and accuracy of the data underlying the reserve. To test the self-insurance liability for worker s compensation and other casualty claims, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying claims data provided to management s actuary and obtaining legal confirmation letters to evaluate the reserves recorded on significant litigated matters. Additionally, we involved our actuarial specialists to assist in our evaluation of the methodologies applied by management s actuary in establishing the actuarially determined reserve. We compared the Company s estimates to ranges of estimates independently developed by our actuarial specialists.

 million to million per occurrence depending on the coverage and whether a claim occurs outside or inside of the United States. Insurance is purchased over deductibles to reduce our exposure to catastrophic events. Estimates are recorded for incurred outstanding liabilities for workers compensation, general, and automobile liability claims that are incurred but not reported. Estimates are based on adjusters estimates, historical experience and statistical methods commonly used within the insurance industry that we believe are reliable. Insurance recoveries related to such liabilities are recorded when considered probable. We have also engaged a third-party actuary to perform a review of our casualty losses as well as losses in our captive insurance companies. Nonetheless, insurance estimates include certain assumptions and management judgments regarding the frequency and severity of claims, claim development and settlement practices. Unanticipated changes in these factors may produce materially different amounts of expense that would be reported under these programs. The Company also self-insures employee health plan exposures in excess of employee deductibles. This program is also reviewed at the end of each policy year by a third-party actuary.

Nonetheless, all of our foreign subsidiaries use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency and local currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars with gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions included in current results of operations. 
 We recorded aggregate foreign currency losses of million, million, and million during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 respectively. The Central Bank of Argentina maintains currency controls that limit our ability to access U.S. dollars in Argentina and remit cash from our Argentine operations. The execution of certain trades known as Blue Chip Swaps effectively results in a parallel U.S. dollar exchange rate. During the fiscal year ended 2023, we entered into a Blue Chip Swap transaction, which resulted in a million loss on investment recorded in Gain on investment securities within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As a result of the Blue Chip Swap transaction, million of net cash was repatriated to the U.S. during the period. 
 Because of the impact of local laws, our future operations in certain areas may be conducted through entities in which local citizens own interests and through entities (including joint ventures) in which we hold only a minority interest or pursuant to arrangements under which we conduct operations under contract to local entities. While we believe that neither operating through such entities nor pursuant to such arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our operations or revenues, there can be no assurance that we will in all cases be able to structure or restructure our operations to conform to local law (or the administration thereof) on terms acceptable to us. 
 Although we attempt to minimize the potential impact of such risks by operating in more than geographical area, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, approximately percent of our operating revenues were generated from international locations compared to percent during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, approximately percent of operating revenues from international locations were from operations in South America compared to percent during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Substantially all of the South American operating revenues were from Argentina and Colombia. The future occurrence of one or more international events arising from the types of risks described above could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 I n November 2022, a fire at a wellsite caused substantial damage to of our super spec-rigs within our North America Solutions segment. The major components were destroyed beyond repair and considered a total loss, and, as a result, these assets were written off and the rig was removed from our available rig count. At the time of the loss, the rig was fully insured under replacement cost insurance. The insurance recovery is expected to exceed the net book value of the components written off. The loss of million and an offsetting insurance recovery for the same amount are recorded within Depreciation and amortization in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we collected million of the total expected insurance proceeds.

 Fiscal Year 2021 Activity 
 In March 2021, the Company's leadership decided to continue the strategy, that began in 2019, which was to focus on operating various types of highly capable upgraded rigs and phasing out the older, less capable fleet. As a result, the Company developed a plan to sell Domestic non-super-spec rigs, all within our North America Solutions segment, the majority of which were previously decommissioned, written down and/or held as capital spares. The book values of those assets were written down to million, which represented their fair value less estimated cost to sell as of the assessment date, and were reclassified as held-for-sale in the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2021. As a result, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 During September 2021, the Company agreed to sell FlexRig land rigs with an aggregate net book value of million to ADNOC Drilling Company P.J.S.C. ("ADNOC Drilling") for million. of the rigs were already located in the U.A.E where ADNOC Drilling is domiciled with the remaining rigs to be shipped from the United States. As part of the sales agreement, the rigs were delivered and commissioned in stages over a period subject to acceptance upon successful completion of final inspection on customary terms and conditions. The net book value of these assets were reclassified as held-for-sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. No rigs were delivered to ADNOC Drilling as of September 30, 2021. 
 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, we formalized a plan to sell assets related to of our lower margin service offerings, trucking and casing running services, which contributed approximately percent to our consolidated revenue during fiscal year 2021, all within our North America Solutions segment. The combined net book values of these assets of million were written down to their combined fair value less estimated cost to sell of million, and were reclassified as held-for-sale. As a result, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of million in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended September 30, 2021 .

 million, in addition to the possibility of future earnout proceeds, resulting in a loss of million recorded in Other (gain) loss on sale of assets within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recognized earnout proceeds associated with the sale of our trucking and casing running assets of million and million during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in Other (gain) loss on sale of assets within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 During the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we identified partial rig substructures that met the asset held-for-sale criteria and were reclassified as Assets held-for-sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The combined net book value of the rig substructures of million were written down to their estimated scrap value of million, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of million within our North America Solutions segment and recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 . During the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, we completed the sale of these assets, resulting in no gain or loss as a result of the sale. During the same period, we identified international FlexRig drilling rigs located in Colombia that met the asset held-for-sale criteria and were reclassified as Assets held-for-sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In conjunction with establishing a plan to sell the international FlexRig drilling rigs, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of million within our International Solutions segment and recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 , as the rigs aggregate net book value of million exceeded the fair value of the rigs less estimated cost to sell of million. During the second quarter of fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 , we completed the sale of the international FlexRig drilling rigs for total consideration of million, resulting in no gain or loss as a result of the sale. 
 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, ADNOC Drilling accepted delivery of rigs with an aggregate net book value of million. As a result, we recognized a gain of million, after incurring million of selling costs, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 in Other (gain) loss on sale of assets within our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Upon final acceptance of delivery, these rigs were removed from assets classified as held-for-sale as of September 30, 2022. We paid approximately million in cash charges attributable to selling costs for the rigs during fiscal year 2022. 
 Fiscal Year 2023 Activity 
 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Company initiated a plan to decommission and scrap international FlexRig drilling rigs and conventional drilling rigs located in Argentina that are not suitable for unconventional drilling. As a result, these rigs were reclassified to Assets held-for-sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The rigs aggregate net book value of million was written down to the estimated scrap value of million, which resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of million within our International Solutions segment and recorded in Asset impairment charges within our Consolidated Statement of Operations during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. 
 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, our North America Solutions assets that were previously classified as Assets held-for-sale at September 30, 2022 were either sold or written down to scrap value. The aggregate net book value of these remaining assets was million, which exceeded the estimated scrap value of million, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of million. During the same period, we also identified additional equipment that met the asset held-for-sale criteria and was reclassified to Assets held-for-sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The aggregate net book value of the equipment of million was written down to its estimated scrap value of million, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. These impairment charges are recorded in Asset impairment charges within our North America Solutions segment in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
 The significant assumptions utilized in the valuations of held-for-sale assets were based on our intended method of disposal, historical sales of similar assets, and market quotes and are classified as Level 2 and Level 3 inputs by ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures. Although we believe the assumptions used in our analysis are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact the analysis and our resulting conclusion.

The Company financed the redemption of the 2025 Notes with the net proceeds from the offering of the 2031 Notes, together with cash on hand. The Company s obligation to redeem the 2025 Notes was conditioned upon the prior consummation of the issuance of the 2031 Notes, which was satisfied on September 29, 2021. 
 On October 27, 2021, we redeemed all of the outstanding 2025 Notes.

 Credit Facility 
 On November 13, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement by and among the Company, as borrower, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto, which was amended on November 13, 2019, providing for an unsecured revolving credit facility (as amended, the 2018 Credit Facility ), that was set to mature on November 13, 2024. On April 16, 2021, lenders with million of commitments under the 2018 Credit Facility exercised their option to extend the maturity of the 2018 Credit Facility from November 13, 2024 to November 12, 2025. No other terms of the 2018 Credit Facility were amended in connection with this extension. On March 8, 2022, we entered into the second amendment to the 2018 Credit Facility, which, among other things, raised the number of potential future extensions of the maturity date applicable to extending lenders from one to two such potential extensions and replaced provisions in respect of interest rate determinations that were based on the London Interbank Offered Rate with provisions based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. Additionally, lenders with million of commitments under the 2018 Credit Facility exercised their option to extend the maturity of the 2018 Credit Facility from November 12, 2025 to November 11, 2026. On February 10, 2023, lenders with million of commitments under the 2018 Credit Facility exercised their option to extend the maturity of the 2018 Credit Facility from November 11, 2026 to November 12, 2027. The remaining million of commitments under the 2018 Credit Facility will expire on November 13, 2024, unless extended by the applicable lender before such date. 
 The 2018 Credit Facility has million in aggregate availability with a maximum of million available for use as letters of credit. The 2018 Credit Facility also permits aggregate commitments under the facility to be increased by million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the procurement of additional commitments from new or existing lenders. In March 2022, the 2018 Credit Facility was amended to change the benchmark rate from the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"). Following the amendment, we can elect to borrow at either an adjusted SOFR rate or an adjusted base rate, plus an applicable margin. The adjusted SOFR rate is the forward-looking term rate based on SOFR for the applicable tenor of one, three, or six months, plus percent per annum. The adjusted base rate is a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) the administrative agent's prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus percent, or (iii) the one-month adjusted SOFR rate plus percent. We also pay a commitment fee on the unused balance of the facility. Borrowing spreads as well as commitment fees are determined based on the debt rating for senior unsecured debt of the Company, as determined by Moody s and Standard Poor s. The applicable margin for SOFR borrowings and adjusted base rate borrowings ranges from percent to percent per annum and to percent per annum, respectively. Commitment fees for both rates range from percent to percent per annum. Based on the unsecured debt rating of the Company on September 30, 2023, the spread over SOFR would have been percent had borrowings been outstanding under the 2018 Credit Facility and commitment fees would have been percent. There is a financial covenant in the 2018 Credit Facility that requires us to maintain a total funded debt to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to percent. The 2018 Credit Facility contains additional terms, conditions, restrictions and covenants that we believe are usual and customary in unsecured debt arrangements for companies of similar size and credit quality, including a limitation that priority debt (as defined in the credit agreement) may not exceed percent of the net worth of the Company. As of September 30, 2023, there were borrowings or letters of credit outstanding, leaving million available to borrow under the 2018 Credit Facility. 
 As of September 30, 2023, we had million in uncommitted bilateral credit facilities, for the purpose of obtaining the issuance of international letters of credit, bank guarantees, and performance bonds.

 Contracts generally contain renewal or extension provisions exercisable at the option of the customer at prices mutually agreeable to us and the customer. For contracts that are terminated by customers prior to the expirations of their fixed terms, contractual provisions customarily require early termination amounts to be paid to us. Revenues from early terminated contracts are recognized when all contractual requirements have been met. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, early termination revenue associated with term contracts was million, million and million, respectively. 
 We also act as a principal for certain reimbursable services and auxiliary equipment provided by us to our clients, primarily related to rig move trucking services, for which we incur costs and earn revenues. Many of these costs are variable, or dependent upon the activity that is performed each day under the related contract. Accordingly, reimbursements that we receive for out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as revenues and the out-of-pocket expenses for which they relate are recorded as operating costs during the period to which they relate within the series of distinct time increments. All of our revenues are recognized net of sales taxes, when applicable. 
 With most drilling contracts, we also receive payments contractually designated for the mobilization and demobilization of drilling rigs and other equipment to and from the client s drill site. Revenue associated with the mobilization and demobilization of our drilling rigs to and from the client s drill site do not relate to a distinct good or service. These revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the related contract term that drilling services are provided. 
 Demobilization fees expected to be received upon contract completion are estimated at contract inception and recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term. The amount of demobilization revenue that we ultimately collect is dependent upon the specific contractual terms, most of which include provisions for reduced or no payment for demobilization when, among other things, the contract is renewed or extended with the same client, or when the rig is subsequently contracted with another client prior to the termination of the current contract. Since revenues associated with demobilization activity are typically variable, at each period end, they are estimated at the most likely amount, and constrained to an amount such that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue previously recognized will not occur. Any change in the expected amount of demobilization revenue is accounted for with the net cumulative impact of the change in estimate recognized in the period during which the revenue estimate is revised. 
 On November 12, 2021, we settled a drilling contract dispute related to drilling services provided from fiscal years 2016 through 2019 with YPF S.A. (Argentina) ("YPF"). The settlement required that YPF make a one-time cash payment to H P in the amount of million and enter into drilling service contracts for drilling rigs, each with multi-year terms. In addition, both parties were released of all outstanding claims against each other, and as a result, H P recognized million in revenue primarily due to accrued disputed amounts. Total revenue recognized as a result of the settlement in the amount of million is included in Drilling services revenue within the International Solutions segment on our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. 
 Contract Costs 
 Mobilization costs include certain direct costs incurred for mobilization of contracted rigs. These costs relate directly to a contract, enhance resources that will be used in satisfying the future performance obligations, and are expected to be recovered. These costs are capitalized when incurred and recorded as current or noncurrent contract fulfillment cost assets (depending on the length of the initial contract term), and are amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the pattern of the transfer of the goods or services to which the asset relates, which typically includes the initial term of the related drilling contract or a period longer than the initial contract term if management anticipates a customer will renew or extend a contract, which we expect to benefit from the cost of mobilizing the rig. Abnormal mobilization costs are fulfillment costs that are incurred from excessive resources, wasted or spoiled materials, and unproductive labor costs that are not otherwise anticipated in the contract price and are expensed as incurred. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we capitalized fulfillment costs of million and million respectively, which is included within Prepaid expenses and Other noncurrent assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 If capital modification costs are incurred for rig modifications or if upgrades are required for a contract, these costs are considered to be capital improvements. These costs are capitalized as property, plant and equipment and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the improvement.

These amounts do not include anticipated contract renewals or expected performance bonuses as part of its calculation. Additionally, contracts that currently contain month-to-month terms are represented in our backlog as of unsatisfied performance obligations. Our contracts are subject to cancellation or modification at the election of the customer; however, due to the level of capital deployed by our customers on underlying projects, we have not been materially adversely affected by contract cancellations or modifications in the past. 
 Contract Assets and Liabilities 
 Amounts owed from our customers under our revenue contracts are typically billed on a monthly basis as the service is being provided and are due within days of billing. Such amounts are classified as accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under certain of our contracts, we recognize revenues in excess of billings, referred to as contract assets, within Prepaid expenses and Other current assets within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 In some instances, we may be entitled to receive payments in advance of satisfying our performance obligations under the contract. We recognize a liability for these payments in excess of revenue recognized, referred to as deferred revenue or contract liabilities, within Accrued liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 We have made awards to certain employees that are subject to market-based performance conditions ("performance units"). Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable performance share unit award agreements and the 2020 Plan, grants of performance units are subject to a vesting period of (the Vesting Period that is dependent on the achievement of certain performance goals. Such performance unit grants consist of separate components. Performance units that comprise the first component are subject to a performance cycle. Performance units that comprise the second component are further divided into separate tranches, each of which is subject to a separate performance cycle within the full performance cycle. The vesting of the performance units is generally dependent on (i) the achievement of the Company s total shareholder return TSR performance goals relative to the TSR achievement of a peer group of companies (the Peer Group over the applicable performance cycle, and (ii) the continued employment of the recipient of the performance unit award throughout the Vesting Period. The Vesting Period for performance units granted in November 2019 ended on December 31, 2022 and the performance units eligible to vest were settled in shares of common stock in January 2023.

 The grant date fair value of performance units was determined through use of the Monte Carlo simulation method. The Monte Carlo simulation method requires the use of highly subjective assumptions. Our key assumptions in the method include the price and the expected volatility of our stock and our self-determined Peer Group companies' stock, risk free rate of return and cross-correlations between the Company and our Peer Group companies. The valuation model assumes dividends are immediately reinvested. As of September 30, 2023, there was million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested performance units.

 million cornerstone investment in ADNOC Drilling in advance of its announced initial public offering, representing million shares of ADNOC Drilling, equivalent to a percent ownership stake and subject to a lockup period. ADNOC Drilling s initial public offering was completed on October 3, 2021, and its shares are listed and traded on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange. Our investment is classified as a long-term equity investment within Investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measured at fair value with any gains or losses recognized through net income (loss) and recorded within Gain (loss) on investment securities on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we early adopted ASU No. 2022-03 which states that the contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security that is publicly traded is not considered in measuring fair value. The provisions of ASU No. 2022-03 were consistent with our historical accounting for our investment in ADNOC Drilling. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we recognized a gain of million and million on our Consolidated Statements of Operations for each period respectively, as a result of the change in fair value of the investment during the period. As of September 30, 2023, this investment is classified as a Level 1 investment based on the quoted stock price on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange. 
 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we sold our remaining equity securities of approximately thousand shares in Schlumberger, Ltd. and received proceeds of approximately million. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we recorded a gain of million related to this investment, which includes a million gain recognized upon the sale of our investment and a million gain as a result of the change in fair value of the investment during the period. This activity is reported in Gain (loss) on investment securities in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. This investment was classified as Level 1 and based on the quoted stock price. 
 Equity Securities with Fair Value Option In October 2022, we made a million equity investment, representing million common shares in Tamboran Resources Limited, a publicly traded company on the Australian Securities Exchange Ltd under the ticker "TBN." Tamboran is focused on playing a constructive role in the global energy transition towards a lower carbon future, by developing a significantly low CO 2 gas resource within Australia's Beetaloo Sub-basin. 
 We believe we have a significant influence, but not control or joint control over the investee, due to several factors, including our ownership percentage (approximately percent as of September 30, 2023), operational involvement and role on the investee's board of directors. Our investment is classified as a long-term equity investment within Investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2023. We consider this investment to have a readily determinable fair value and have elected to account for this investment using the fair value option with any changes in fair value recognized through net income (loss). Under the guidance, Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, this investment is classified as a Level 1 investment based on the quoted stock price which is publicly available. During the year ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a loss of million recorded within Gain (loss) on investment securities on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, as a result of the change in fair value of the investment during the period. 
 Debt Securities During April 2022, the Company made a million cornerstone investment in Galileo Holdco 2 Limited Technologies ("Galileo Holdco 2"), part of the group of companies known as Galileo Technologies Galileo in the form of notes with an option to convert into common shares of the parent of Galileo Holdco 2 ("Galileo Parent"). Galileo specializes in liquification, natural gas compression and re-gasification modular systems and technologies to make the production, transportation, and consumption of natural gas, biomethane, and hydrogen more economically viable. The convertible note bears interest at percent per annum with a maturity date of the earlier of April 2027 or an exit event (as defined in the agreement as either an initial public offering or a sale of Galileo). During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, our convertible note agreement with Galileo was amended to include any interest which has accrued but not yet compounded or issued as a note. As a result, we have included accrued interest in our total investment balance. We currently do not intend to sell this investment prior to its maturity date or an exit event. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of the convertible note was approximately equal to the cost basis.

 Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 
 We have certain assets that are subject to measurement at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. For these nonfinancial assets, measurement at fair value in periods subsequent to their initial recognition is applicable if they are determined to be impaired. These assets generally include property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets, and operating lease right-of-use assets. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, these would generally be classified within Level 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Further details on any changes in valuation of these assets is provided in their respective footnotes. 
 Equity Securities 
 We also hold various other equity securities without readily determinable fair values, primarily comprised of geothermal investments.

 Fluctuations in actuarial gains and losses during the period are primarily due to changes in the discount rate and investment returns. The mortality table issued by the Society of Actuaries in October 2021 was used for the September 30, 2023 pension calculation.

 Investment Strategy and Asset Allocation 
 Our investment policy and strategies are established with a long-term view in mind. The investment strategy is intended to help pay the cost of the Pension Plan while providing adequate security to meet the benefits promised under the Pension Plan. We maintain a diversified asset mix to minimize the risk of a material loss to the portfolio value that might occur from devaluation of any single investment. In determining the appropriate asset mix, our financial strength and ability to fund potential shortfalls are considered. Pension Plan assets are invested in portfolios of diversified public-market equity securities and fixed income securities. The Pension Plan does not directly hold securities of the Company. 
 The expected long-term rate of return on Pension Plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the Pension Plan s investment portfolio after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of the return and volatility of various asset classes. 
 During the 2021 fiscal year, we implemented a glide-path strategy with a goal to reduce risk as certain funded levels are achieved and began aligning our fixed income exposure with our pension liabilities.

 The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various other pending legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. We maintain insurance against certain business risks subject to certain deductibles. Although no assurance can be given, we believe, based on our experiences to date and taking into account established reserves and insurance, that the ultimate resolution of such items will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. When we determine a loss is probable of occurring and is reasonably estimable, we accrue an undiscounted liability for such contingencies based on our best estimate using information available at that time. If the estimated loss is a range of potential outcomes and there is no better estimate within the range, we accrue the amount at the low end of the range. We disclose contingencies where an adverse outcome may be material, or in the judgment of management, we conclude the matter should otherwise be disclosed.

 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report have been designed and are effective at the reasonable assurance level so that the information required to be disclosed by us in our SEC filings, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules, regulations, and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We believe that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. 
 b) Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

 Generally, in the case of an annual meeting, stockholders must deliver to the Secretary of H&P a written notice between 90 and 120 days before the anniversary date of our immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders. In the case of an annual meeting where we have changed the date of the annual meeting to more than 30 days before or after the anniversary date of our immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders or in the case of a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing directors, stockholders must deliver the notice (a) no earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such meeting and (b) no later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such meeting or the tenth day following the day on which the public announcement of the date of the meeting is made. Our bylaws prescribe specific information that any such stockholder notice must contain, including, without limitation, various information and representations related to stockholder proposed nominee(s) for election as a director, the stockholder giving the notice, the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made and other persons related to such matter. 

Exhibit 4.1 

 Director nominations and stockholder proposals that are late or that do not include all required information may be rejected. This could prevent stockholders from bringing certain matters before an annual meeting, including making nominations for directors. 
 
 Vacancies on the Board of Directors 
 
 Our bylaws provide that vacancies on the board of directors arising through death, resignation, retirement, removal, an increase in the number of directors or otherwise shall be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum. 
 
 Issuance of Preferred Stock 
 
 Our certificate of incorporation authorizes up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series, and the board of directors, without further approval of the stockholders, is authorized to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions applicable to each series of preferred stock. The purpose of authorizing the board of directors to determine these rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions is to eliminate delays associated with a stockholder vote on specific issuances. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, adversely affect the voting power of our then-existing stockholders and, under certain circumstances, make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of H&P. 
 
 Merger Provisions 
 
 Our certificate of incorporation provides that the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding stock entitled to vote thereon is required in order for us to 
 
 merge and or consolidate with any other corporation unless we own at least 90 of the outstanding shares of the other corporation or 
 sell, lease, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets or business. 
 
 Our certificate of incorporation also provides that the affirmative vote of at least three-fourths of the outstanding stock entitled to vote thereon is required in order for us to 
 
 sell, lease, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets or business to a related corporation (defined as a stockholder owning more than 5 of our outstanding shares of any class of stock entitled to vote) or an affiliate of a related corporation 
 merge with a related corporation or an affiliate of a related corporation or 
 enter into a combination or majority share acquisition in which we are the acquiring corporation and our voting shares are issued or transferred to a related corporation or an affiliate of a related corporation or to stockholders of a related corporation. 
 
 Delaware Business Combination Statute 
 
 We are a Delaware corporation and are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. Section 203 prohibits a business combination between a corporation and an interested stockholder within three years of the time the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless 
 
 prior to such time, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder 
 upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85 of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, exclusive of shares owned by directors who are also officers and by certain employee stock plans or 

Exhibit 4.1 

 at or subsequent to such time, the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at a stockholders meeting by at least two thirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder. 
 
 Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Generally, an interested stockholder is a person who owns, individually or with or through other persons, 15 or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock. 
 
 Exclusive Forum 
 
 Our bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum (a) the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent arising out of or relating to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware provided, however, that, in the event that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction over any such action or proceeding, the sole and exclusive forum for such action or proceeding shall be another state or federal court located within the State of Delaware, in each such case, unless the Court of Chancery (or such other state or federal court located within the State of Delaware, as applicable) has dismissed a prior action by the same plaintiff asserting the same claims because such court lacked personal jurisdiction over an indispensable party named as a defendant therein and (b) the sole and exclusive forum for any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, to the fullest extent permitted by law, shall be the federal district courts of the United States of America. While the Delaware Supreme Court has upheld the validity of similar provisions under the DGCL, there is uncertainty as to whether a court in another state would enforce such a forum selection provision. In addition, our bylaws provide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to this exclusive forum provision. This exclusive forum provision is not intended to apply to claims arising under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our exclusive forum provision does not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.

 Exhibit 97 

HELMERICH & PAYNE, INC. 
 Rule 10D-1 Clawback Policy 
 
 1. Recoupment of Incentive-Based Compensation 
 The purpose of this policy (this Policy is to permit Helmerich & Payne, Inc. H&P, and together with its subsidiaries, the Company ), in the event that H&P is required to prepare an accounting restatement of H&P s financial statements due to material non-compliance with any financial reporting requirement under U.S. federal securities laws (including any such correction that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period), to recover the amount of any Incentive-Based Compensation received by a Covered Executive during the Clawback Period that is in excess of the amount that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the restated financial statements. 
 This Policy is intended to comply with and, as applicable, to be administered and interpreted consistent with, Section 303A.14 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, as adopted by the New York Stock Exchange to implement Rule 10D-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (collectively, Rule 10D-1 ). 
 2. Policy Administration and Definitions 
 This Policy is administered by the Board of Directors of H&P (the Board ). 
 For purposes of this Policy 
 Incentive-Based Compensation means any compensation granted, earned or vested based in whole or in part on the Company s attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure that was Received by a person (i) on or after October 2, 2023 and after the person began service as a Covered Executive, and (ii) who served as a Covered Executive at any time during the performance period for the Incentive-Based Compensation. 
 A Financial Reporting Measure is (i) any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing H&P s financial statements and any measure derived wholly or in part from such a measure, and (ii) any measure based in whole or in part on H&P s stock price or total shareholder return. Incentive-Based Compensation includes cash compensation and any equity awards to the extent based in whole or in part on such attainment. 
 Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed to be Received in the fiscal period during which the relevant Financial Reporting Measure is attained, regardless of when the compensation is actually paid or awarded. 
 Covered Executive means any executive officer of H&P as defined under Rule 10D-1. 
 Clawback Period means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that H&P is required to prepare the accounting restatement described in this Policy and any transition period of less than nine months that is within or immediately following such three fiscal years, all as determined pursuant to Rule 10D-1. 
 3. Determinations by the Board Binding Effect 
 If the Board determines that the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that is Received by a Covered Executive during the Clawback Period exceeds the amount that would have been Received if determined or calculated based on H&P s restated financial results, such excess amount of Incentive-Based Compensation will be subject to mandatory recoupment by the Company on a reasonably prompt basis pursuant to this Policy. 

For Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, the Board will determine the amount based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement on the relevant stock price or total shareholder return. 
 In all cases, the calculation of the excess amount of Incentive-Based Compensation to be recovered will be determined on a pre-tax basis. 
 Any determinations made by the Board under this Policy shall be final, binding and conclusive on all affected individuals. 
 4. Methods of Clawback 
 The Company may implement a clawback pursuant to this Policy in any manner consistent with applicable law, including by requiring payment of such amount(s) to the Company, by set-off, by reducing future compensation, or by such other means or combination of means as the Board determines to be appropriate. 
 The Company need not recover the excess amount of Incentive-Based Compensation if and to the extent that the Board determines that such clawback is impracticable and not required under Rule 10D-1, including if the Board determines that the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered after making a reasonable attempt to recover such amounts. 
 The Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executive against the loss of any Incentive-Based Compensation pursuant to this Policy. 
 The Company is authorized to take appropriate steps to implement this Policy with respect to Incentive-Based Compensation arrangements with Covered Executives. 
 5. No Impairment of Other Remedies 
 Any recoupment under this policy is in addition to any other remedies that may be available to the Company, including, without limitation, such remedies contained in the Company s equity grant arrangements, any other policy of the Company, or any other legal remedies available to the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, this Policy shall be applied and interpreted independently of any other applicable forfeiture, clawback or recoupment policies or provisions in plans or agreements entered into or maintained by the Company provided that the Company shall not recoup amounts pursuant to such other policy, terms or remedies to the extent it is recovered pursuant to this Policy. This Policy is also in addition to, and is not a substitute for, the requirements of Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
