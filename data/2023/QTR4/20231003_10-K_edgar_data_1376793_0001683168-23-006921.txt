PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Cavitation Technologies, Inc. (referred to herein,
unless otherwise indicated, as the Company, CTi, we, us, and our is a Nevada corporation originally incorporated under the name Bio Energy, Inc. We are a process and product development firm that has
developed, patented, and commercialized environmentally friendly technology-based systems that are designed to serve large, growing,
global markets such as vegetable oil refining, renewable fuels, water treatment, wines and spirits enhancement, algae oil extraction,
water-oil emulsions and crude oil yield improvement. Our systems are designed to process industrial liquids at a reduced processing time,
lower operating cost, improved yield while operating in environmentally friendly manner. Our patented Nano Reactor and LPN 
are the critical components of our business and we have generated all of our revenue while utilizing these components. 

Vegetable Oil Refining 

Our first commercial application for our technology
has been the CTi Nano Neutralization System which has been utilized to improve edible vegetable oil refining process. Our
environmentally friendly process has been shown to reduce refining costs, increase oil yield, and limit the number of chemical additives
used in chemical refining of vegetables oils. This patented process (US Patent # 7,762,715 and # 8,042,989) is designed to be incorporated
into new and existing soybean, rapeseed, canola and palm vegetable oil refineries. 

Our first pilot test of our CTi NANO Neutralization 
System was conducted in 2010 at Carolina Soya, a 200-metric ton/day crude soy oil refining plant in Estill, South Carolina. Our second
system, which became operational in fiscal 2011, has been continuously utilized since 2011 at the plant that processes approximately 450
metric tons per day of soy oil. Further, we have successfully shipped over 50 systems domestically and internationally. We also continuously
focus on developing additional Nano Reactor applications and managing the intellectual property issues associated with new
processes and applications. 

The global consumption of vegetable oils has grown
consistently at a rate of about 4.1 p.a. from 90.5 million metric tons (MMT) in 2001 to approximately 213 million metric tons (MMT) in
2021-2022. In 2021-2022 consumption of vegetable oil was 213.2 MMT compared to 206.4 MMT in 2020-2021, an increase approximately 3 (https://www.statista.com/statistics/263978/global-vegetable-oil-production-since-2000-2001/).
It is also a highly competitive commodity market in which the lowest-cost producer has the advantage. 

Desmet Ballestra Agreement 

On May 14, 2012, we signed a global R D,
Marketing and Technology License Agreement with Desmet Ballestra Group s.a. (Desmet), a Belgian company that is actively marketing
the NANO Neutralization System, the key component of which is our Nano Reactor to soybean and other vegetable
oil refiners. The Agreement provided Desmet (licensee) a limited, exclusive license and right to develop, design and supply our NANO
Neutralization System which incorporates Nano Reactor devices on a global basis tools and fats and oleo chemical
applications. The agreement expired in May 2015. 

On January 22, 2016, Desmet and the Company executed
a new three year License Agreement with essentially the same terms with the May 2012 agreement that was effective August 1, 2015. As part
of the agreement, Desmet provided, under certain conditions, limited monthly advance payments of 50,000 to be applied against gross profit
share from future sales. The agreement expired in August 2018. 

3 

On October 1, 2018, Desmet and the Company executed
a new three year License Agreement with essentially the same terms with the January 2016 agreement. As part of the agreement, Desmet provided
us under certain conditions, limited monthly advances of 50,000 through October 1, 2021, to be applied against gross profit share from
future sales. The agreement expired in October 2021. 

On November 1, 2021, Desmet and the Company executed
a new three-year License Agreement with essentially the same terms with the January 2018 agreement. As part of the agreement, Desmet provides
the Company monthly advances of 40,000 through November 1, 2024, to be applied against from future reactor sales, however, the Company
is no longer entitled to gross profit share from future sales. 

Desmet, together with its affiliates, is a global
engineering and equipment supply firm engaged in the development, design and supply of process equipment for oils and fats processing
facilities including vegetable oil refining, biofuel, oleo chemical, seed crushing, surfactant and detergent markets. Desmet supplies
these markets with services based on the latest globally sourced technologies. Desmet has relationships with major refiners globally A
significant portion of global vegetable oil refineries include major refiners such as Archer Daniels Midland Company, Cargill, Inc. and
Bunge Limited. Desmet has more than 40 sales representatives selling in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Since its founding
in 1946, Desmet reports that it has built a global network that includes 1,300 employees, 17 global and 8 representative offices, and
more than 6,000 lines in a variety of applications. Desmet operates a separate division for each of the above markets and the Desmet Oils
 Fats division has supplied small and large plants to approximately 1,900 oil millers in 150 countries, covering over 6,300 process
sections. 

Along with Desmet, we have been working together
to accelerate appropriate sales goals and installation process. Our CTi Nano Neutralization Systems is designed to be used
as an add-on process to an existing neutralization system within soybean and other vegetable oil refineries. Desmet s focus has
been on marketing our CTi Nano Neutralization Systems to vegetable oil refiners to help them increase profits through cost
savings and improved oil yields. Desmet purchases our CTi Nano Neutralization Systems from us and installs them at the refinery
as part of an integrated neutralization system. Based on successful commercial implementations, Desmet guarantees minimum economic benefits
to a facility that installs our CTi Nano Neutralization Systems . We are therefore substantially dependent on Desmet to identify
prospects, complete sales contracts, install the system and manage relationships with end-users. 

Additionally, in fiscal 2017 Desmet installed
our first Nano Reactor at a bio-diesel production plant in South America. Bio-diesel industry has been under pricing pressure
for a considerable period of time and slow to adopt to newer technologies. We are continuously working with Desmet pursuing additional
sales opportunities in Asia and South America, however, the acceptance of our technology has been slow and there were no sales generated
in our Fiscal 2023 and 2022. 

Enviro Watertek, LLC 

In April 2019, the Company and Delaware Water
Company, LLC (Delaware) formed a limited liability company called Enviro WaterTek LLC Enviro , EW ). Enviro
is owned 50 by the Company and 50 by Delaware, and the Company accounts for its investment in Enviro under the equity method of accounting.
From 2019 to 2023, Enviro had insignificant operations. This agreement covers our first commercial entrance into industrial treatment
of produced and frac water. Fracking industry has seen a significant growth over the past ten years, reaching daily water consumption
volume of over 58 million barrels per day. Our newly designed Low Pressure Nano Reactor LPN was specifically developed
to be integrated into produced water treatment system along with our proprietary chemical formulations, and has depicted measurable and
quantifiable advantages over industry standard processes and equipment. Our agreement with EW provides for sales on LPN 
plus recurring revenue stream based on processing of produced and frac water volumes and utilization. Our agreement with EW has a fifteen-year
term. In March 2020, global pandemic of COVID-19 has taken an unexpected negative impact on the oil and gas industry worldwide, and has
consequently impaired our ability to rapidly accelerate LPN sales and recurring revenue stream. While the industry has gone
through a major overhaul, we are seeing a gradual recovery in the industry. Our current system installations can handle approximately
25,000 barrels per day (BPD), and we received 20,000 and 46,000 in total revenue in Fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, from sale of
reactors and usage fee.

Alchemy Beverages, Inc 

In fiscal 2014, Roman Gordon, one of our shareholders
and a former officer, formed a company, Cameo USA LLC (Cameo). Since its formation, Cameo has had no revenue, no operations, and has had
no assets or liabilities. On June 4, 2018, Mr. Gordon contributed his 100 interest in Cameo to Cavitation Technologies, Inc. As Mr. Gordon
had no reasonable and objectively supportable basis in the valuation of his investment in Cameo, there was no value assigned to the contribution
of Cameo. 

On June 29, 2018, we agreed to license Cameo to
Alchemy Beverages Inc. ABI ). In addition, we have agreed to provide certain licensing rights related to our miniature low
pressure nano-reactor (MLPN) to be used in developing and manufacturing of small home appliances to enhance alcoholic beverages. In consideration
for these ABI has agreed to issue 19.9 of ABI s outstanding common shares to us (limited to 20 million shares of ABI). ABI is a
private company and in the business of producing and selling alcoholic beverages, equipment, and home appliances. Prior to this agreement,
ABI was independent of CTI and had no relation to us nor to our management. 

Pursuant to the licensing agreements, ABI will
have the exclusive global marketing and distribution rights of Cameo and our patented and patent pending technologies for the processing
of alcoholic beverages. We have agreed to assist in the installation and maintenance of the MLPN to ABI and will receive royalty payments
ranging from 1 to 3 on all net revenues, as defined in our license agreement for the life of the applicable patents. In addition, we
will receive leasing, consulting, and manufacturing fees as defined in the licensing agreement. 

As of June 30, 2023 and the date of this report,
ABI has not generated any sales under Cameo brand. Since June 2018, the Company and ABI have developed a small table top home appliance
unit Barmuze utilizing MLPN , allowing consumers to experience a new way of enjoying wines and spirits, utilizing CTi s patented
and patent pending technologies to molecularly restructure alcohol, convert harsh acids to pleasant tasting esters, and reduce levels
of certain impurities commonly present in alcohol. 

During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we have received
approval for several patent applications, protecting our technology and processing rights, expanding our broad portfolio of patents. 

During fiscals 2023 and 2022, there were no sales
or royalties generated pertaining to our agreement with Alchemy Beverages, Inc. The investment in ABI has no value assigned to it, which
approximates its fair value. 

Customers Dependence 

We continue to sell our industrial capacity Nano
Reactor and Nano Neutralization System through our strategic partner Desmet and most of our revenue for the
fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, was derived from sales of reactors to Desmet and the corresponding gross profit share. We
have generated minimal revenue pertaining to our licensing agreement with EW in our fiscal 2023. We had no revenue of LPN 
due to COVID-19, whereas oil production in US has negative impact on oil gas industry. Oil and gas industry has seen a
recovery, while price of oil has spiked to around 100 per barrel, and we foresee a great opportunity for our technology providing a
significant upside potential both at the point of sale and recurring revenue stream. 

5 

Sources and availability of raw materials and
the names of principal suppliers 

We have historically sourced reactor components
from various domestic and international suppliers. We do not have any long-term contracts, agreements, or commitments with any supplier.
We believe it would take approximately 30 days to find a new supplier, if necessary. 

Competition 

Our competitors who sell equipment and engineering
services for the vegetable oil refining business are a myriad of companies both large and small that provide equipment and technology
to oil refiners. These include known companies that have longer operating histories, more experience, and stronger financial capabilities.
Competitors include Alfa Laval, and Crown Iron Works as well as many firms that provide advice and services to small and regional firms.
In addition, Arisdyne Systems, a designer of cavitation devices, is marketing a system using similar technology. The vegetable oil refining
business is a highly competitive commodity market in which the lowest-cost producer has the advantage. We intend to compete by offering
solutions that help our clients remain or become a low-cost producer. Because the industry in which we compete has had limited new technology
introduced in the last 50 years, we believe our CTi Nano Neutralization Systems provide a unique opportunity for refiners
to increase margins. We seek to differentiate ourselves by offering solutions based on our proprietary and patented designs, processes,
and applications to help our clients described in our issued and patent pending applications. We compete by offering solutions that we
believe can reduce operating expenses and increase oil yield vs currently applied technologies. 

In addition, our competitors in produced and frac
water treatment application range from local service providers to multi-national global corporations with considerable financial resources,
engineering expertise, established and proven technologies. We believe that LPN is a conceptually new technology that has
not been introduced in the field of water treatment applications up to now. LPN has demonstrated exceptional results in
treating produced and frac water commercially, significantly reducing the usage of hazards chemicals during the process, meanwhile, achieving
desirable water quality for industrial re-use or disposal. 

Patents 

Our Cavitation Generator patent was issued during
fiscal 2011. In addition, we have a patent for our Multi-Stage Cavitation Device Nano Reactor that was issued on October 25,
2011. In the fiscal 2014 we received approvals for another apparatus patent and 2 additional process patents in the US. As of June 30,
2023, our portfolio of patents included 19 issued patents in the United States and 12 issued patents internationally. Our patents cover
multiple process and applications of our technology in vegetable oil refining, production of biodiesel, treatment of process and industrial
water, upgrade of hydrocarbons and enhancing of alcoholic beverages. We continuously develop new technologies and applications, as we
have filed new patent applications for Low Pressure Nano-Reactors LPN . LPN is a highly efficient homogenizer
and emulsifier that can be utilized in multiple fluids processing applications. Recently, we have filed a patent application for a small
home appliance. This new product is designed directly with consumer in mind and the first step for our company to introduce our technology
outside of the industrial sector where we typically sell our products.

Royalty Agreements 

On July 1, 2008, our wholly owned subsidiary entered
into Patent Assignment Agreements with two parties, our President as well as our former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) who currently serves
as our Technology Senior Manager, where certain devices and methods involved in our hydrodynamic cavitation processes invented by the
President and former CEO/current Technology Senior Manager have been assigned to the subsidiary. In exchange, that subsidiary agreed to
pay a royalty of 5 of gross revenues to each of the President and former CEO/current Technology Senior Manager for licensing of the technology
and leasing of the related equipment embodying the technology. These agreements were subsequently assumed by us on May 13, 2010, from
our subsidiary. Our former CEO/current Technology Senior Manager and President both waived their rights to receive royalty payments
that have accrued, or that may accrue, on any gross revenue generated through June 30, 2023. 

On April 30, 2008 and as amended on November 22,
2010, our wholly owned subsidiary entered into an employment agreement with its former Director of Chemical and Analytical Department
(the Inventor to pay, in the first year, an amount equal to 5 of actual gross revenue received by us on any patent for
which the Inventor was a legally named inventor, and, in each subsequent year, 3 of actual gross revenue received by us on any such patent.
Since entering into that employment agreement, and during the term of this employment agreement, we have not received any revenue on any
patents for which the Inventor was a legally named inventor.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis should
be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based
upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as its plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Its actual
results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. 

Overview of Our Business 

We are a Nevada corporation originally incorporated
under the name Bio Energy, Inc. On January 29, 2007, we incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, Hydrodynamic Technology, Inc. as a California
corporation. 

We have developed, patented, and commercialized
proprietary technology that can be used for processing of various industrial and consumer-oriented fluids. Our patented Nano Reactor 
 is the critical components of the CTi Nano Neutralization System which has been shown to reduce operating costs and increase
yields in processing oils and fats. CTi holds and applied for numerous patents covering technology and various processes in US and Internationally,
covering vegetable and crude oil refining, processed and frac water treatment, algae oil extraction, and alcoholic beverage enhancement.
During our Fiscal 2022, we have continuously worked on developing additional technologies and products related to low pressure nano reactor LPN ). LPN is designed to become a highly efficient mixer and homogenizer. We believe that LPN 
has a great commercial utilization opportunity by providing efficient and cost-effective solution in multiple fluid processing industries.
 LPN has a number of advantages over current mechanically operated mixers and homogenizers. Industrial application of our
technology in produced and frac water treatment system, LPN along with our proprietary chemical formulations have depicted
measurable and quantifiable advantages over industry standard processes and equipment. Additionally, our miniature low pressure nano reactor
 MLPN has become an integral part of Barmuze , a small home appliance device for enhancing taste and extracting unwanted impurities
typically present in alcoholic beverages. 

During the year ended June 30, 2023, we recorded
revenue of 433,000 and incurred a net loss of 2,040,000, respectively. 

Inflation and potential recession 

We are, and our suppliers are experiencing significant
broad-based inflation of manufacturing and distribution costs as well as transportation challenges, partially as a result of the pandemic.
Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, it
may in the future. We are monitoring cost structures and evaluating to what extent any such costs can be passed on to customers, taking
into account the overall impact of increasing inflation and interest rate pressures on consumers. We expect input cost inflation to continue
at least throughout 2023. If we are unable to successfully manage the effects of inflation, our business, operating results, cash flows
and financial condition may be adversely affected. Additionally, there have been various economic indicators that the United States economy
may be entering a recession in upcoming quarters. An economic recession could potentially impact the general business environment and
the capital markets, which may have a material negative impact on our financial results. 

12 

Management s Plan of Operation 

We are continuously engaged in manufacturing of
our Nano Reactor and Nano Neutralization Systems which are designed to help refine vegetable oils such as soybean,
canola and rapeseed. Additionally, we have developed LPN s that provide commercial opportunity in industrial water
treatment, enhancement of alcoholic beverages, and MLPN being utilized in a consumer small home appliance. 

During the year ended June 30, 2023, we incurred
net loss of 2,040,000 and used cash in operating activities of 423,000. As of June 30, 2023, we have a working capital deficiency of
 846,000 and a stockholders deficit of 919,000. 

Management s plan is to generate income
from operations by licensing our technology globally through Desmet Ballestra Group (Desmet), agreements with EnviroWaterTek and Alchemy
Beverages, Inc. In October 2018, we signed a three-year global R and D, Marketing and Technology License Agreement with Desmet
for the sale and licensing of our Nano Reactor and Nano Neutralization Systems . This agreement is a continuation
of the original agreement we signed with Desmet in May 2012. As part of the agreement, Desmet is also obligated to provide us with monthly
advances of 40,000 to be applied against the sale of reactors. During the year ended June 30, 2023, advances received from Desmet amounted
to 724,000 and revenues totaled 413,000. These funds service operational expenses on monthly basis. 

There was no revenue produced in relationship
to our agreement with Alchemy Beverages, Inc. 

We anticipate that we may need additional funding,
and we may attempt to raise additional debt and/or equity financing to fund operations and to provide additional working capital. However,
there is no assurance that such financing will be consummated or obtained in sufficient amounts necessary to meet our needs, or that we
will be able to meet our future contractual obligations. Should management fail to obtain such financing, we may curtail its operations. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Revenue Recognition 

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management
to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses. The accounting policies and estimates described below are those we consider most critical in preparing its consolidated
financial statements. The following is a review of the accounting policies and estimates that include significant judgments made by management
using information available at the time the estimates are made. However, these estimates could change materially if different information
or assumptions were used instead. 

Note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial
statements includes a summary of significant accounting policies, estimates, and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Accounting estimates are an integral part of the preparation of financial statements and are based on judgments by management using its
knowledge and experience about the past and current events and assumptions regarding future events, all of which we consider to be reasonable.
These judgments and estimates reflect the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and that affect the carrying value of our assets
and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. 

13 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company follows the guidance of Accounting
Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . ASC 606 creates a five-step model that requires entities
to exercise judgment when considering the terms of contracts, which includes (1) identifying the contracts or agreements with a customer,
(2) identifying our performance obligations in the contract or agreement, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction
price to the separate performance obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company only
applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange
for the services it transfers to its clients. 

Revenue from sale of our Nano Reactor 
and LPN is recognized when products are shipped from our manufacturing facilities as this is our sole performance obligation
under these contracts and we have no continuing obligation to the customer. 

The Company also recognizes revenue from its share
of gross profit to be earned from distributors, as defined, which we treat as variable consideration and recognize using the most likely
amount method. Estimates are available from our distributor which are considered in the determination of the most likely amount. However,
given the lack of control over the sale to the end customer and the lack of history of prior sales, the amount of gross profit revenue
recognized is limited to the actual amount of cash received under the contract which the Company has determined is not refundable and
that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. 

In addition, the Company also recognizes revenues
from usage fees of certain reactors. Usage fees are recognized based on actual usage by the customer. 

Leases 

The Company accounts for leases under guidance
of Accounting Standards Codification ASC 842, which requires an entity to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability
for virtually all leases. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. The Company accounts
for the lease and non-lease components of its office lease as a single lease component. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. 

Equity Method Investment 

The Company accounts for investments in entities
in which the Company has significant influence over the entity s financial and operating policies, but does not control, using the
equity method of accounting. The equity method investments are initially recorded at cost, and subsequently increased for capital contributions
and allocations of net income, and decreased for capital distributions and allocations of net loss. Equity in net income (loss) from the
equity method investment is allocated based on the Company s economic interest. The Company assesses its investment in equity method
investments for recoverability, and if it is determined that a loss in value of the investment is other than temporary, the Company writes
down the investment to its fair value. Based on Management s assessment, the value of its equity method investment was impaired
as of June 30, 2023 and as such, recorded an impairment charge of 1,112,000. As of June 30, 2023, the remaining value of its investments
was 1,000. 

Share-Based Compensation 

The Company periodically issues stock options
and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for financing costs. The Company accounts
for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based on the authoritative guidance provided by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board whereas the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized over the vesting period. The Company accounts
for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non- employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board whereas the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the
date at which a performance commitment is reached, or b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments
is complete. Non-employee stock-based compensation charges generally are amortized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. In
certain circumstances where there are no future performance requirements by the non-employee, option grants are immediately vested and
the total stock-based compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date.

Revenue 

During the year ended June 30, 2023, revenue decreased
to 433,000 due primarily from reduced sales of our Nano Reactor and CTi Nano Neutralization Systems to Desmet of 413,000.
In addition, the Company also recorded an aggregate revenue of 20,000 from water processing usage fees to Enviro Watertek, LLC. 

During the year ended June 30, 2022, our revenue
was 1,665,000 and it was derived from the sale of our Nano Reactor and CTi Nano Neutralization Systems to Desmet of
 592,000 and share in gross margin share of 1,027,000, of which, the Company is no longer entitled in fiscal 2023. In addition, we recorded
an aggregate revenue of 46,000 from the sale of LPN and water processing usage fee to Enviro Watertek, LLC. 

Cost of Sales 

During the year ended June 30, 2023 and June 30,
2022, cost of sales was 121,000 and 41,000, respectively, an increase of 80,000. 60 , or 48,000, of the increase was associated with
the Company writing off inventory determined no longer sellable and the remaining 32,000 was for services associated with our sales to
Desmet. 

15 

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses for fiscal 2023 amounted to
 1,198,000 versus 1,923,000 in fiscal 2022, a decrease of 725,000 or 38 . The decrease in operating expenses was attributed to a decrease
in advertising expenses of 63,000 a decrease in consulting fees of 33,000, legal fees of 17,000, accounting fees of 12,000, non-cash
stock based compensation expense of 66,000, and payroll expenses of 322,000. In addition, there was an impairment charge of 178,000
on equipment in fiscal 2022 that did not occur in fiscal 2023. The decrease in Research and Development expenses of 14,000 was offset
by increases in various professional service fees paid during the fiscal 2023 year. 

Operating expenses for fiscal 2022 amounted to
 1,923,000 versus 1,285,000 in fiscal 2021, an increase of 638,000 or 50 . The increase in operating expenses was attributed to an increase
in advertising expenses of 95,000, an impairment charge of 178,000 on equipment, an increase in consulting fees of 99,000, an increase
in legal fees of 54,000, non-cash stock based compensation expense of 352,000. 

Net Loss 

Our reporting net loss in fiscal 2023 was 2,040,000
compared to 619,000 in fiscal 2022. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our cash balance at June 30, 2023 was 18,000,
a decrease of 423,000 compared to 441,000 at June 30, 2022. 

For the year ended June 30, 2023 cash used in
operating activities was 423,000. 

For the year ended June 30, 2022 cash used in
operating activities was 484,000, cash used in investing activities was 1,223,000, and cash provided by financing activities was 785,000. 

Going concern 

During the year ended June 30, 2023, we incurred
a net loss of 2,040,000 and used cash in operating activities of 423,000. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date that the financial statements are issued. In addition, the Company s
independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on our June 30, 2023 financial statements, has raised substantial doubt about
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Management s plan is to generate income
from operations by continuing to license its technology globally, including our agreements with EW and ABI. 

We may also attempt to raise additional debt and/or
equity financing to fund operations and to provide additional working capital. There is no assurance that such financing will be available
in the future or obtained in sufficient amounts necessary to meet our needs, that we will be able to achieve profitable operations or
that we will be able to meet our future contractual obligations. Should management fail to obtain such financing, we may curtail its operations. 

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

FIRM 

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
Cavitation Technologies, Inc.

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Cavitation Technologies, Inc. (the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements
of operations, changes in stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1, the Company has incurred recurring
operating losses, used cash in operations since inception and has a stockholders deficit at June 30, 2023. These matters raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters
are also described in Note 1 to the financial statements. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial
statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matter 

Critical audit matters
are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to
the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our
especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters. 

We have served as the Company s auditor
since 2013.

,
used cash in operating activities of and had a stockholders deficit of as of June 30, 2023.
These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The
accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from an inability of the Company to
continue as a going concern. 

As of June 30, 2023, the Company has cash in the
amount of . The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to continue to implement its
business plan. Currently, management s plan is to increase revenues by continuing to license its technology globally. While the
Company believes in the viability of its strategy to increase revenues, there can be no assurances to that effect. The Company believes it has enough cash to sustain operations through December, 2023. 

The Company may also attempt to raise additional
debt and/or equity financing to fund operations and to provide additional working capital. There is no assurance that such financing will
be available in the future or obtained in sufficient amounts necessary to meet the Company s needs, that the Company will be able
to achieve profitable operations or that the Company will be able to meet its future contractual obligations. Should management fail to
obtain such financing, the Company may curtail its operations. 

During the year ended June 30, 2023, the COVID-19
pandemic did not have a material net impact on our operating results. The Company has not observed any impairments of its assets or a
significant change in the fair value of its assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At this time, it is not possible for the Company to predict
the duration or magnitude of the adverse results of the outbreak and its effects on the Company s business or results of operations,
financial condition, or liquidity. 

cash equivalents. 

The Company maintains its cash with one domestic
financial institution. From time to time, cash balances in this domestic bank may exceed federally insured limits provided by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC of up to 250,000. 

As of June 30, 2023, Company had no deposits in
excess of federally insured limit with one bank. The Company believes that no significant concentration of credit risk exists with respect
to this cash balances because of its assessment of the creditworthiness and financial viability of this financial institution.

was inventory balance as of June 30, 2023.

Management assesses the carrying value of property
and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If there is indication
of impairment, management prepares an estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.
If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated
fair value.

During the year ended June 30, 2023, the
Company issued 
shares of common stock upon cashless exercise of 
warrants. 

Year Ending June 30, 2022 

During the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company
granted warrants to purchase shares of common stock in relation to the issuance of common stock (see Common Stock above). 

On August 1, 2021, the Company granted a service

The fair value of the warrant awards was estimated

Contractual terms (years) 
 years 
 
 Expected volatility 

Expected dividend yield 

The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S.
Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of measurement corresponding with the expected term of the warrants; the contractual terms
represents full contractual term the warrants; expected volatility is based upon historical volatility of the Company s common stock;
and the expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has not paid dividends in the past and does not expect to pay dividends
in the future. 

State income taxes, net of Federal benefit 

Valuation allowance 

Income tax provision 

Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences
in the recognition of income and expenses for the financial reporting purposes and for tax purposes. The components of deferred tax assets
are presented below. 

At June 30, 2023, the Company had available Federal
NOL carryforwards of approximately million that are available to reduce future taxable income. The Federal NOL carry forward expires
through 2037. The NOLs are subject to statutory limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 regarding substantial changes in ownership
of companies with loss carry forwards. 

During the year ended June 30, 2023 and 2022,
management has determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will not be able to realize the tax benefit of the carryforwards
due to recurring operating losses. Based on their valuation, the Company determined that the net deferred tax assets, do not meet the
requirements to realize, and as such, the Company has provided a full valuation allowance against them. 

At June 30, 2023 and 2022, significant component of the Company s
deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: 

Stock compensation expense 

Total net deferred tax assets 

Less valuation discount

Accounting rules prescribes a recognition threshold
that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements and provides guidance on recognition, measurement,
classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition issues. The Company classifies interest
and penalties as a component of interest and other expenses. To date, there have been no interest or penalties assessed or paid. 

The Company measures and records uncertain tax
positions by establishing a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return. Only tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized
or continue to be recognized.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

In accordance with rule 13a-15(a), our management
must maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange
Act, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules
and forms, and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b) and (c), management
must also evaluate the effectiveness of these disclosure control and procedures at the end of each fiscal year. As of June 30, 2023, we
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June
30, 2023. 

Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control
over financial reporting is designed under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officer, and effected by
our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes
those policies and procedures that: 

(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 

(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements. 

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of our internal controls and procedures, (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) as of the year ended June 30, 2023. Management conducted as assessment of our internal control
over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Our management concluded that as of June 30, 2023, our
internal control over financial reporting was not effective, and that material weaknesses existed in the following areas as of June 30,
2023: 

1. 
 We do not employ full time in-house personnel with the technical knowledge to identify and address some of the reporting issues surrounding certain complex or non-routine transactions. With respect to material, complex and non-routine transactions, management has and will continue to seek guidance from third-party experts and/or consultants to gain a thorough understanding of these transactions; 

2. 
 We have ineffective controls over segregation of duties due to limited resources and number of employees. 

39 

We are in the continuous process of improving
our internal control over financial reporting in an effort to eliminate these material weaknesses through improved supervision and training
of our staff, but additional effort is needed to fully remedy these deficiencies. We intend to hire the necessary staff to address the
weaknesses once additional capital is obtained which will allow full operations to commence. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the year ended June 30, 2023 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. 

Attestation 

Pursuant to Item 308(b) of Regulation S-K, as
amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Wall Street Reform Act), this report does not include an attestation
report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. The Wall Street Reform
Act permanently exempts small public companies from the requirement to obtain an external audit on the effectiveness of internal financial
reporting controls.

Code Section 162(m) Provisions 

Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code, or the Code, generally disallows a tax deduction to public companies for compensation in excess of 1 million paid to the Chief
Executive Officer or any of the four most highly compensated officers. Performance-based compensation arrangements may qualify for an
exemption from the deduction limit if they satisfy various requirements under Section 162(m). Although we consider the impact of
this rule when developing and implementing our executive compensation programs, we believe it is important to preserve flexibility in
designing compensation programs. Accordingly, we have not adopted a policy that all compensation must qualify as deductible under Section 162(m)
of the Code. While our stock options are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation (as defined by the Code),
amounts paid under our other compensation programs may not qualify as such.

ITEM 12. Security Ownership of Certain
Beneficial Owners and Management 

The following table provides information regarding
the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of September 26, 2023, (the Evaluation Date by: (i) each of our current
directors, (ii) each of our named executive officers, and (iii) all such directors and executive officers as a group. We know
of no other person or group of affiliated persons who beneficially own more than five percent of our common stock. The table is based
upon information supplied by our officers, directors and principal stockholders and a review of Schedules 13D and 13G, if any, filed with
the SEC. Unless otherwise indicated in the footnotes to the table and subject to community property laws where applicable, we believe
that each of the stockholders named in the table has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares indicated as beneficially
owned. 

Applicable percentages are based on 284,289,740
shares outstanding as of the Evaluation Date, adjusted as required by rules promulgated by the SEC. These rules generally attribute beneficial
ownership of securities to persons who possess sole or shared voting power or investment power with respect to those securities. In addition,
the rules include shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options or warrants that are either immediately
exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of the Evaluation Date. These shares are deemed to be outstanding and beneficially owned by
the person holding those options for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of that person, but they are not treated as outstanding
for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

ITEM 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 

Certain Related Party Transactions 

Since the beginning of our last fiscal year ,
there has not been, and there is not currently proposed, any transaction or series of similar transactions to which we were or will be
a party in which the amount involved exceeded or will exceed the lesser of 120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets
at year-end for the last two completed fiscal years and in which any of our directors, executive officers, holders of more than five percent
of any class of our voting securities or any member of the immediate family of the foregoing persons had or will have a direct or indirect
material interest. 

Accrued Payroll and Payroll Taxes 

As of June 30, 2023, and 2022, the Company had
accrued unpaid salaries to officers and former officers amounting to 247,000 for both periods presented. 

Cameo USA LLC 

In fiscal 2014, Roman Gordon, one of the Company s
shareholders and a former officer, formed a company called Cameo USA LLC (Cameo). Since its formation, Cameo has had no revenue, no operations,
and has had no assets or liabilities. On June 4, 2018, Mr. Gordon contributed his 100 interest in Cameo to the Company. As Mr. Gordon
had no basis in his investment in Cameo, there was no value assigned to the contribution of Cameo. Subsequent to the contribution of Cameo
to the Company, Cameo was sold to Alchemy Beverages Inc. 

Director Independence 

As our common stock is currently traded on the
OTC Bulletin Board, we are not subject to the rules of any national securities exchange which require that a majority of a listed company's
directors and specified committees of the board of directors meet independence standards prescribed by such rules. For the purpose of
preparing the disclosures in this Report on Form 10-K regarding director independence, we have used the definition of independent
director set forth in the Marketplace Rules of The NASDAQ, which defines an independent director generally as a person
other than an executive officer or employee of the Company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the
Company's board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.
Consistent with these standards, we believe that James Fuller is an Independent Financial Expert.

(2)

45 

Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 

Consistent with SEC policies regarding auditor
independence, the Audit Committee has responsibility for appointing, setting compensation and overseeing the work of the independent registered
public accounting firm. In recognition of this responsibility, the Audit Committee has established a policy to pre-approve all audit and
permissible non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. 

Prior to the engagement of the independent registered
public accounting firm for the next year s audit, management will submit a list of services and related fees expected to be rendered
during that year for audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other fees to the Audit Committee for approval.
