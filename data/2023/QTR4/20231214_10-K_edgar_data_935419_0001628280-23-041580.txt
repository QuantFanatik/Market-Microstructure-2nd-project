 Nightclubs Segment 
 We operate our adult entertainment nightclubs through several brands that target many different demographics of customers by providing a unique, quality entertainment environment. Our clubs do business as Rick s Cabaret, Jaguars Club, Tootsie s Cabaret, XTC Cabaret, Club Onyx, Hoops Cabaret and Sports Bar, Scarlett s Cabaret, Diamond Cabaret, Cheetah Gentlemen's Club, PT's Showclub, Playmates Club, Country Rock Cabaret, Temptations Adult Cabaret, Foxy s Cabaret, Vivid Cabaret, Downtown Cabaret, Cabaret East, The Seville, Silver City Cabaret, Heartbreakers Gentlemen's Club, Kappa Men s Club, Baby Dolls, and Chicas Locas. We also operate one dance club under the brand name Studio 80. 
 We generate revenue from our nightclubs through the sale of alcoholic beverages, food, and merchandise items; service in the form of cover charge, licensing fees, and room rentals; and through other related means such as ATM commissions and vending income, among others. 
 During fiscal 2023, our Nightclub segment sales mix was 43.6 service revenue; 40.7 alcoholic beverages; and 15.7 food, merchandise, and other. Segment gross margin (revenues less cost of goods sold, divided by revenues) was approximately 88.9 . Our Nightclubs segment revenue increased by approximately 14.8 and income from operations decreased by 11.6 compared to the prior year. Same-stores sales for Nightclubs in 2023 was -3.5 . 
 During fiscal 2023, we acquired six gentlemen s clubs, certain related real estate properties, and associated intellectual property through two transactions with an aggregate acquisition price of 75.5 million (with a combined fair value of 72.3 million). These six clubs contributed 18.2 million in revenues during fiscal 2023. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for details of the transactions. 
 For a list of our nightclub locations, refer to Item 2 Properties. 
 Bombshells Segment 
 Our Bombshells segment operates a restaurant and bar concept that sets itself apart with d cor that pays homage to all branches of the U.S. military. Locations feature local DJs, large outdoor patios, and more than 75 state-of-the-art flat screen TVs for watching your favorite sports. All food and drink menu items have military names. Bombshell Girls, with their military-inspired uniforms, are a key attraction. Their mission, in addition to waitressing, is to interact with guests and generate a fun atmosphere. Bombshells is also franchising under our subsidiary, BMB Franchising Services, Inc., which has been approved to sell franchises in all 50 states. On December 22, 2020, the Company signed a franchise development agreement with a group of private investors to open three Bombshells locations in San Antonio, Texas, over a period of five years, and the right of first refusal for three more locations in Corpus Christi, New Braunfels, and San Marcos, all in Texas. On May 2, 2022, the Company signed its second franchise development agreement with a private investor to open three Bombshells locations in the state of Alabama over a period of five years. We opened one company-owned location in Arlington, Texas (Dallas area), in December 2021 and our first franchised location opened in June 2022 in San Antonio, Texas. In February 2023, we acquired the San Antonio franchise location and terminated our franchise and development agreement. As of September 30, 2023, we have twelve company-owned Bombshells locations, all in Texas with two in the Dallas area, one in Austin, one in San Antonio, and eight in the Greater Houston area. In December 2022, we acquired a food hall in Denver, Colorado. Subsequent to our fiscal 2023 year-end, we opened one Bombshells location in Stafford, Texas in November 2023.

 Other Segment 
 We group together all businesses not belonging to either Nightclubs and Bombshells as Other reportable segment. This is made up of several wholly-owned subsidiaries composed primarily of our Media Group and Drink Robust. Our Media Group is the leading business communications company serving the multibillion-dollar adult nightclubs industry and the adult retail products industry. It owns a national industry convention and trade show; two national industry trade publications; two national industry award shows; and more than a dozen industry and social media websites. Included in the Media Group is ED Publications, publishers of the bimonthly ED Club Bulletin, the only national business magazine serving the 2,200-plus adult nightclubs in North America, which collectively have annual revenues in excess of 5 billion, according to the Association of Club Executives. ED Publications, founded in 1991, also publishes the Annual VIP Guide of adult nightclubs, touring entertainers and industry vendors; and produces the Annual Gentlemen s Club Owners EXPO, a national convention and trade show. The Media Group produces two nationally recognized industry award shows for the readers of both ED Club Bulletin and StorErotica magazines, and maintains a number of B-to-B and consumer websites for both industries. Drink Robust is licensed to sell Robust Energy Drink in the United States. 
 OUR STRATEGY 
 Our overall objective is to create value for our shareholders by developing and operating profitable businesses in the hospitality and related space. We strive to achieve that by providing an attractive price-value entertainment, dining experience, and top-notch service; by attracting and retaining quality personnel; and by focusing on unit-level operating performance. Aside from our operating strategy, we employ a capital allocation strategy. 
 Capital Allocation Strategy 
 Our capital allocation strategy provides us with disciplined guidelines on how we should use our free cash flows; provided however, that we may deviate from this strategy if other strategic rationale warrants. We calculate free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities minus maintenance capital expenditures. Using the after-tax yield of buying our own stock as baseline, management believes that we are able to make better investment decisions. 
 Based on our current capital allocation strategy: 
 We consider buying back our own stock if the after-tax yield on free cash flow is above 10 ; 
 We consider acquiring or developing our own clubs or restaurants that we believe have the potential to provide a minimum cash on cash return of 25 -33 , absent an otherwise strategic rationale; 
 We consider disposing of underperforming units to free up capital for more productive use; 
 We consider paying down our most expensive debt if it makes sense on a tax-adjusted basis, or there is an otherwise strategic rationale. 
 Over a five-year period from fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2023, we improved diluted earnings per share at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of approximately 8 , which was mainly caused by increasing revenue at a CAGR of approximately 12 , and flowing through net income at a CAGR of approximately 7 . As a result, net cash provided by operating activities improved at approximately 18 and free cash flow at also approximately 18 CAGR for the same period. See discussions of our non-GAAP financial measures starting on page 41 .

 COMPETITION 
 The adult entertainment and the restaurant/sports bar businesses are highly competitive with respect to price, service and location. All of our nightclubs compete with a number of locally owned adult clubs, some of whose brands may have name recognition that equals that of ours. The names Rick s and Rick s Cabaret, Tootsie s Cabaret, XTC Cabaret, Scarlett s, Silver City, Club Onyx, Downtown Cabaret, Temptations, The Seville, Jaguars, Hoops Cabaret, Foxy s Cabaret, "Studio 80," Country Rock Cabaret, PT s, Diamond Cabaret, Baby Dolls Saloon," "Baby Dolls," and "Chicas Locas" are proprietary. In the restaurant/sports bar business, Bombshells is also proprietary. We believe that the combination of our existing brand name recognition and the distinctive entertainment environment that we have created allows us to compete effectively in the industry and within the cities where we operate. Although we believe that we are well positioned to compete successfully, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our high level of name recognition and prestige within the marketplace. 
 GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS 
 We are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business activities. Particularly in Texas, the authority to issue a permit to sell alcoholic beverages is governed by the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission TABC ), which has the authority, in its discretion, to issue the appropriate permits. We presently hold a Mixed Beverage Permit and a Late Hour Permit at numerous Texas locations. Colorado, Minnesota, North Carolina, Louisiana, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Florida, New York, Kentucky, Maine, Indiana, and Illinois have similar laws that may limit the availability of a permit to sell alcoholic beverages or that may provide for suspension or revocation of a permit to sell alcoholic beverages in certain circumstances. It is our policy, prior to expanding into any new market, to take steps to ensure compliance with all licensing and regulatory requirements for the sale of alcoholic beverages, as well as the sale of food. 
 In addition to various regulatory requirements affecting the sale of alcoholic beverages, in many cities where we operate, the location of an adult entertainment cabaret is subject to restriction by city, county or other governmental ordinance. The prohibitions deal generally with distance from schools, churches and other sexually oriented businesses, and contain restrictions based on the percentage of residences within the immediate vicinity of the sexually oriented business. The granting of a sexually oriented business permit is not subject to discretion; the permit must be granted if the proposed operation satisfies the requirements of the ordinance. In all states where we operate, management believes we are in compliance with applicable city, county, state or other local laws governing the sale of alcohol and sexually oriented businesses. 
 TRADEMARKS 
 Our rights to the trade names RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc., Rick s, Rick s Cabaret, Tootsie s Cabaret, Club Onyx, XTC Cabaret, Temptations, Jaguars, Downtown Cabaret, Cabaret East, Bombshells Restaurant and Bar, Vee Lounge, Mile High Men s Club, Country Rock Cabaret, PT s, and Diamond Cabaret are established under common law, based upon our substantial and continuous use of these trade names in interstate commerce, some of which have been in use at least as early as 1987. We have registered our service mark, RICK S AND STARS DESIGN, and the BOMBSHELLS RESTAURANT BAR logo design with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We have also obtained service mark registrations from the Patent and Trademark Office for RICK S AND STARS DESIGN logo, RCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC., RICK S, RICK S CABARET, CLUB ONYX, XTC CABARET, SCARLETT S CABARET, SILVER CITY CABARET, BOMBSHELLS RESTAURANT AND BAR, THE SEVILLE CLUB, DOWN IN TEXAS SALOON, HOOPS CABARET, VEE LOUNGE, STUDIO 80, FOXY S CABARET, EXOTIC DANCER, TOYS FOR TATAS, "LA BOHEME GENTLEMAN'S CLUB," MILE HIGH MEN S CLUB, MHMC logo, AFTER DARK, COUNTRY ROCK CABARET, PT S, DIAMOND CABARET, "CABARET ROYALE," "BABY DOLLS SALOON," "BABY DOLLS TOPLESS SALOON," "BABY DOLLS," "JAGUARS," and BOMBSHELLS OFFICER S CLUB are registered through service mark registrations issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. As of this date, we have pending registration applications for the names TOOTSIES CABARET, RICK'S REWARDS, VENICE CABARET, "CHERRY CREEK FOOD HALL AND BREWERY," and THE MANSION. We also own the rights to numerous trade names associated with our media division. There can be no assurance that these steps we have taken to protect our service marks will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our protected intellectual property rights.

 EMPLOYEES AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS 
 Our people are employed by the parent company or by its subsidiaries. Executive officers are employed by the registrant (parent company); shared services personnel and managers responsible for multiple clubs or restaurants are employed by RCI Management Services, Inc.; and the rest are employed by the individual operating entities. As of September 30, 2023, we had the following employees: 
 Operations Managers Non-Managers Corporate Total Hourly 24 3,183 19 3,226 Salaried 408 59 85 552 432 3,242 104 3,778 
 Additionally, as of September 30, 2023, we had independent contractor entertainers who are self-employed and conduct business at our locations on a non-exclusive basis. Our entertainers at Rick s Cabaret in Minneapolis, Minnesota and at Jaguars Club in Phoenix, Arizona may elect to act as commissioned employees. All employees and independent contractors sign arbitration non-class-action participation agreements, where allowed by federal and state laws. None of our employees are represented by a union. We consider our employee relations to be good. 
 We believe that the adult entertainment industry standard of treating entertainers as independent contractors provides us with safe harbor protection to preclude payroll tax assessment. We have prepared plans that we believe will protect our profitability in the event that the sexually oriented business industry is required in all states to convert entertainers, who are now independent contractors, into employees. See related discussion in Risk Factors below. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below before deciding to purchase shares of our common stock. If any of the events, contingencies, circumstances or conditions described in the risks below actually occurs, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be seriously harmed. The trading price of our common stock could, in turn, decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. 
 A summary of our risk factors is as follows: 
 Risks related to general macroeconomic and safety conditions 
 The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt our business, which has and could continue to materially affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations for an extended period of time. 
 Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war. 
 If we are unable to maintain compliance with certain of our debt covenants or unable to obtain waivers, we may be unable to make additional borrowings and be declared in default where our debt will be made immediately due and payable. In addition, global economic conditions may make it more difficult to access new credit facilities. 
 We have recorded impairment charges in current and past periods and may record additional impairment charges in future periods.

 Risks related to regulations and/or regulatory agencies 
 Our business operations are subject to regulatory uncertainties which may affect our ability to continue operations of existing nightclubs, acquire additional nightclubs, or be profitable. 
 The adult entertainment industry standard is to classify adult entertainers as independent contractors, not employees. If federal or state law mandates that they be classified as employees, our business could be adversely impacted. 
 Our revenues could be significantly affected by limitations relating to permits to sell alcoholic beverages. 
 Activities or conduct at our nightclubs may cause us to lose necessary business licenses, expose us to liability, or result in adverse publicity, which may increase our costs and divert management s attention from our business. 
 Risks related to our business 
 We may deviate from our present capital allocation strategy. 
 We may need additional financing, or our business expansion plans may be significantly limited. 
 There is substantial competition in the nightclub entertainment industry, which may affect our ability to operate profitably or acquire additional clubs. 
 The adult entertainment industry is extremely volatile. 
 Private advocacy group actions targeted at the kind of adult entertainment we offer could result in limitations and our inability to operate in certain locations and negatively impact our business. 
 We rely heavily on information technology in our operations and any material failure, weakness, interruption or breach of security could prevent us from effectively operating our business. 
 We are exposed to risks related to cyber security and protection of confidential information, and failure to protect the integrity and security of payment card or individually identifiable information of our guests and employees or confidential and proprietary information of the Company could damage our reputation and expose us to loss of revenues, increased costs and litigation. 
 
 Our acquisitions may result in disruptions in our business and diversion of management s attention. 
 We face a variety of risks associated with doing business with franchisees and licensees. 
 The impact of new club or restaurant openings could result in fluctuations in our financial performance. 
 Our ability to grow sales through delivery orders is uncertain. 
 We incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management devotes substantial time to new compliance initiatives. 
 We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. 
 We may have uninsured risks in excess of our insurance coverage. 
 We are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us. 
 Our previous liability insurer may be unable to provide coverage to us and our subsidiaries. 
 The protection provided by our service marks is limited. 
 We are dependent on key personnel.

 If we are not able to hire, develop, and retain qualified club and restaurant employees and/or appropriately plan our workforce, our growth plan and profitability could be adversely affected. 
 A failure to maintain food safety throughout the supply chain and food-borne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business. 
 Our venture, expansion, and renovation projects may face significant inherent risks. 
 Other risk factors may adversely affect our financial performance. 
 Risk related to our common stock 
 We must continue to meet NASDAQ Global Market Continued Listing Requirements, or we risk delisting. 
 We may be subject to allegations, defamations, or other detrimental conduct by third parties, which could harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers and/or contribute to a deflation of our stock price. 
 Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to seasonality and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, resulting in a decline in our stock price. 
 Anti-takeover effects of the issuance of our preferred stock could adversely affect our common stock. 
 Future sales or the perception of future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress our stock price. 
 Our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future. 
 Cumulative voting is not available to our stockholders. 
 Our directors and officers have limited liability and have rights to indemnification. 
 Details of our risk factors are as follows: 
 Risks related to general macroeconomic and safety conditions 
 The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt our business, which has and could continue to materially affect our operations, financial condition and results of operations for an extended period of time. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse effect that was material on our business. The COVID-19 pandemic, federal, state and local government responses to COVID-19, our customers responses to the pandemic, and our Company s responses to the pandemic all disrupted our business. In the United States, state and local governments imposed a variety of restrictions on people and businesses and public health authorities offered regular guidance on health and safety. Once COVID-19 vaccines were approved and moved into wider distribution in the United States in early 2021, public health conditions improved and almost all of the COVID-19 restrictions on businesses eased. During fiscal 2022, increases in the numbers of cases of COVID-19 throughout the United States including the Omicron variant which impacted our restaurants in the second quarter, mostly in January 2022, subjected some of our restaurants to other COVID-19-related restrictions such as mask and/or vaccine requirements for team members, guests or both. Exclusions and quarantines of restaurant team members or groups thereof disrupt an individual restaurant s operations and often come with little or no notice to the local restaurant management. In the last couple of years, along with COVID-19, our operating results were impacted by geopolitical and other macroeconomic events, leading to higher than usual inflation on wages and other cost of goods sold. These events further impacted the availability of team members needed to staff our restaurants and caused additional disruptions in our product supply chain.

 Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war. 
 The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and the more recent Israel-Hamas war could have adverse effects on global macroeconomic conditions which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These conflicts are highly unpredictable and have already resulted in significant volatility in oil and natural gas prices worldwide. 
 If we are unable to maintain compliance with certain of our debt covenants or unable to obtain waivers, we may be unable to make additional borrowings and be declared in default where our debt will be made immediately due and payable. In addition, global economic conditions may make it more difficult to access new credit facilities. 
 Our liquidity position is, in part, dependent upon our ability to borrow funds from financial institutions and/or private individuals. Certain of our debts have financial covenants that require us to maintain certain operating income to debt service ratios. As of September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with all covenants. Due to the impact of COVID-19 and other external factors such as supply chain disruption, the conflicts in Ukraine and in the Gaza Strip, and the potential economic slowdown, our financial performance in future periods could be negatively impacted. A failure to comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility or obtain waivers would give rise to an event of default under the terms of certain of our debts, allowing the lenders to accelerate repayment of any outstanding debt. 
 We have recorded impairment charges in current and past periods and may record additional impairment charges in future periods. 
 Our nightclubs are often acquired with a purchase price based on historical EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization). This results in certain nightclubs carrying a substantial amount of intangible asset value, mostly allocated to licenses and goodwill. Generally accepted accounting principles require periodic impairment review of indefinite-lived intangible assets, long-lived assets, and goodwill to determine if, or when events and circumstances indicate that, the fair value of these assets is not recoverable. As a result of our periodic impairment reviews, we recorded impairment charges of 12.6 million in 2023 (representing 4.2 million of goodwill impairment on four clubs, 6.5 million of SOB license impairment on eight clubs, 1.0 million of operating lease right-of-use asset on one club, 814,000 of software impairment on two investment projects, and 58,000 of property and equipment impairment on one club); 1.9 million in 2022 (representing 566,000 of goodwill impairment on one club, 293,000 of SOB license impairment on one club, and 1.0 million of property and equipment impairment on one club and one Bombshells unit); and 13.6 million in 2021 (representing 6.3 million of goodwill impairment on seven clubs, 5.3 million of SOB license impairment on three clubs, and 2.0 million of property and equipment impairment on four clubs and one held-for-sale property). A huge portion, if not all, of the impairments in 2021 related to the then-projected decline in EBITDA caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. If difficult market and economic conditions materialize over the next year and/or we experience a decrease in revenue at one or more nightclubs or restaurants, we could incur a decline in fair value of one or more of our nightclubs or restaurants. This could result in future impairment charges of up to the total value of our tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill. We actively monitor our clubs and restaurants for any indication of impairment. 
 Risks related to regulations and/or regulatory agencies 
 Our business operations are subject to regulatory uncertainties which may affect our ability to continue operations of existing nightclubs, acquire additional nightclubs, or be profitable. 
 Adult entertainment nightclubs are subject to local, state and federal regulations. Our business is regulated by local zoning, local and state liquor licensing, local ordinances, and state and federal time place and manner restrictions. The adult entertainment provided by our nightclubs has elements of speech and expression and, therefore, enjoys some protection under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. However, the protection is limited to the expression, and not the conduct of an entertainer. While our nightclubs are generally well established in their respective markets, there can be no assurance that local, state and/or federal licensing and other regulations will permit our nightclubs to remain in operation or profitable in the future.

 The adult entertainment industry standard is to classify adult entertainers as independent contractors, not employees. If federal or state law mandates that they be classified as employees, our business could be adversely impacted. 
 The adult entertainment industry standard is to classify adult entertainers as independent contractors, not employees. The Internal Revenue Service regulations and applicable state law guidelines regarding independent contractor classification are subject to judicial and agency interpretation, and it could be determined that the independent contractor classification is inapplicable. Further, if legal standards for classification of independent contractors change, it may be necessary to modify our compensation structure for these adult entertainers, including by paying additional compensation or reimbursing expenses. While we take steps to ensure that our adult entertainers are deemed independent contractors, if our adult entertainers are determined to have been misclassified as independent contractors, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state law, workers compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings. Any of these outcomes could result in substantial costs to us, could significantly impair our financial condition and our ability to conduct our business as we choose, and could damage our ability to attract and retain other personnel. 
 Our revenues could be significantly affected by limitations relating to permits to sell alcoholic beverages. 
 We derive a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of alcoholic beverages. States in which we operate may have laws which may limit the availability of a permit to sell alcoholic beverages, or which may provide for suspension or revocation of a permit to sell alcoholic beverages in certain circumstances. The temporary or permanent suspension or revocations of any such permits would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition and results of operations. In all states where we operate, management believes we are in compliance with applicable city, county, state or other local laws governing the sale of alcohol. 
 Activities or conduct at our nightclubs may cause us to lose necessary business licenses, expose us to liability, or result in adverse publicity, which may increase our costs and divert management s attention from our business. 
 We are subject to risks associated with activities or conduct at our nightclubs that are illegal or violate the terms of necessary business licenses. Some of our nightclubs operate under licenses for sexually oriented businesses and are afforded some protection under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. While we believe that the activities at our nightclubs comply with the terms of such licenses, and that the element of our business that constitutes an expression of free speech under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is protected, activities and conduct at our nightclubs may be found to violate the terms of such licenses or be unprotected under the U.S. Constitution. This protection is limited to the expression and not the conduct of an entertainer. An issuing authority may suspend or terminate a license for a nightclub found to have violated the license terms. Illegal activities or conduct at any of our nightclubs may result in negative publicity or litigation. Such consequences may increase our cost of doing business, divert management s attention from our business and make an investment in our securities unattractive to current and potential investors, thereby lowering our profitability and our stock price. 
 We have developed comprehensive policies aimed at ensuring that the operation of each of our nightclubs is conducted in conformance with local, state and federal laws. We have a no tolerance policy on illegal drug use in or around our facilities. We continually monitor the actions of entertainers, waitresses and customers to ensure that proper behavior standards are met. However, such policies, no matter how well designed and enforced, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the policies objectives are being achieved. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems and policies, there can be no assurance that our policies will prevent deliberate acts by persons attempting to violate or circumvent them. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations, management believes that our policies are reasonably effective in achieving their purposes. 
 Risks related to our business 
 We may deviate from our present capital allocation strategy. 
 We believe that our present capital allocation strategy will provide us with optimized returns. However, implementation of our capital allocation strategy depends on the interplay of several factors such as our stock price, our outstanding common shares, the interest rates on our debt, and the rate of return on available investments. If these factors are not conducive to implementing our present capital allocation strategy, or we determine that adopting a different capital allocation strategy is in the best interest of shareholders, we reserve the right to deviate from this approach. There can be no assurance that we will not deviate from or adopt an alternative capital allocation strategy moving forward.

 We may need additional financing, or our business expansion plans may be significantly limited. 
 If cash generated from our operations is insufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, we will need to raise additional funds through the public or private sale of our equity or debt securities. The timing and amount of our capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including cash flow and cash requirements for nightclub acquisitions and new restaurant development. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership percentage of our then-existing shareholders will be diluted. We cannot ensure that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. Any future equity financing, if available, may result in dilution to existing shareholders; and debt financing, if available, may include restrictive covenants. Any failure by us to procure timely additional financing, if needed, will have material adverse consequences on our business operations. 
 There is substantial competition in the nightclub entertainment industry, which may affect our ability to operate profitably or acquire additional clubs. 
 Our nightclubs face substantial competition. Some of our competitors may have greater financial and management resources than we do. Additionally, the industry is subject to unpredictable competitive trends and competition for general entertainment dollars. There can be no assurance that we will be able to remain profitable in this competitive industry. 
 The adult entertainment industry is extremely volatile. 
 Historically, the adult entertainment, restaurant and bar industry has been an extremely volatile industry. The industry tends to be extremely sensitive to the general local economy, in that when economic conditions are prosperous, adult entertainment industry revenues increase, and when economic conditions are unfavorable, entertainment industry revenues decline. Coupled with this economic sensitivity are the trendy personal preferences of the customers who frequent adult nightclubs. We continuously monitor trends in our customers tastes and entertainment preferences so that, if necessary, we can make appropriate changes which will allow us to remain one of the premiere adult nightclubs. However, any significant decline in general corporate conditions or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we have historically catered to a clientele base from the upper end of the market. Accordingly, further reductions in the amounts of entertainment expenses allowed as deductions from income under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, could adversely affect sales to customers dependent upon corporate expense accounts. 
 Private advocacy group actions targeted at the kind of adult entertainment we offer could result in limitations in our inability to operate in certain locations and negatively impact our business. 
 Our ability to operate successfully depends on the protection provided to us under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. From time to time, private advocacy groups have sought to target our nightclubs by petitioning for non-renewal of certain of our permits and licenses. Furthermore, private advocacy groups which have influences on certain financial institutions have managed to sway these financial institutions into not doing business with us. In addition to possibly limiting our operations and financing options, negative publicity campaigns, lawsuits and boycotts could negatively affect our businesses and cause additional financial harm by discouraging investors from investing in our securities or requiring that we incur significant expenditures to defend our business. 
 We rely heavily on information technology in our operations and any material failure, weakness, interruption, or breach of security could prevent us from effectively operating our business. 
 Our operations and corporate functions rely heavily on information systems, including point-of-sale processing, management of our supply chain, payment of obligations, collection of cash, electronic communications, data warehousing to support analytics, finance and accounting systems, mobile technologies to enhance the customer experience, and other various processes and procedures, some of which are handled by third parties. Our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, maintenance problems, upgrading or transitioning to new platforms, or a breach in security relating to these systems could result in delays in consumer service and reduce efficiency in our operations. These problems could adversely affect our results of operations, and remediation could result in significant, unplanned capital investments. 
 We are exposed to risks related to cyber security and protection of confidential information, and failure to protect the integrity and security of payment card or individually identifiable information of our guests and employees or 
 13

 confidential and proprietary information of the Company could damage our reputation and expose us to loss of revenues, increased costs and litigation. 
 Our technology systems contain personal, financial, and other information that is entrusted to us by our guests and employees, as well as financial, proprietary, and other confidential information related to our business, and a significant portion of our sales are by credit or debit cards. If our technology systems, or those of third-party services providers we rely upon, are compromised as a result of a cyber-attack (including whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks, hacking, phishing attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, or social engineering) or other external or internal method, it could result in an adverse and material impact on our reputation, operations, and financial condition. The cyber risks we face range from cyber-attacks common to most industries, to attacks that target us due to the confidential consumer information we obtain through our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions. Such security breaches could also result in litigation or governmental investigation against us, as well as the imposition of penalties. These impacts could also occur if we are perceived either to have had an attack or to have failed to properly respond to an incident. 
 We are subject to a variety of continually evolving and developing laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. The use and disclosure of such information is regulated and enforced at the federal, state and international levels, and these laws, rules and regulations are subject to change. 
 As privacy and information security laws and regulations change or cyber risks evolve pertaining to data, we may incur significant additional costs in technology, third-party services, and personnel to maintain systems designed to anticipate and prevent cyber-attacks. As with many public companies, our defenses are under attack regularly. There might be minor intrusions from time to time. We have added certain preventive measures to reduce cyber risks. However, we cannot provide assurance that our security frameworks and measures will be successful in preventing future significant cyber-attacks or data loss. 
 Our acquisitions may result in disruptions in our business and diversion of management s attention. 
 We have made and may continue to make acquisitions of complementary nightclubs, restaurants or related operations. Any acquisitions will require the integration of the operations, products and personnel of the acquired businesses and the training and motivation of these individuals. Such acquisitions may disrupt our operations and divert management s attention from day-to-day operations, which could impair our relationships with current employees, customers and partners. We may also incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions. These issuances could be substantially dilutive to our stockholders. In addition, our profitability may suffer because of acquisition-related costs or amortization, or impairment costs for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. If management is unable to fully integrate acquired business, products or persons with existing operations, we may not receive the benefits of the acquisitions, and our revenues and stock trading price may decrease. 
 We face a variety of risks associated with doing business with franchisees and licensees. 
 We started franchising Bombshells in 2015. We believe that we have selected highly competent operating partners and franchisees with significant experience in restaurant operations, and we are providing them training and support on the Bombshells brand. However, the probability of opening, ultimate success and quality of any franchise or licensed restaurant rests principally with the franchisee. If the franchisee does not successfully open and operate its restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards, or if guests have negative experiences due to issues with food quality or operational execution, our brand value could suffer, which could have an adverse impact on our business. 
 The impact of new club or restaurant openings could result in fluctuations in our financial performance. 
 Performance of any new club or restaurant location will usually differ from its originally targeted performance due to a variety of factors, and these differences may be material. New clubs and restaurants typically encounter higher customer traffic and sales in their initial months, which may decrease over time. Accordingly, sales achieved by new or reconcepted locations may not be indicative of future operating results. Additionally, we incur substantial pre-opening expenses each time we open a new establishment, which expenses may be higher than anticipated. Due to the foregoing factors, results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year.

 Our ability to grow sales through delivery orders is uncertain. 
 Part of our strategy for restaurant growth is dependent on increased sales from guests that want our food delivered to them. We currently rely on third-party delivery providers for the ordering and payment platforms that receive guest orders and that send orders directly to our point-of-sale system. These platforms could be damaged or interrupted by technological failures, cyber-attacks, or other factors, which may adversely impact our sales through these channels. 
 Delivery providers generally fulfill delivery orders through drivers that are independent contractors. These drivers may make errors, fail to make timely deliveries, damage our food, or poorly represent our brands, which may lead to customer disappointment, reputational harm and unmet sales expectations. Our sales may also be adversely impacted if there is a shortage of drivers that are willing and available to make deliveries from our restaurants. We also incur additional costs associated with delivery orders, and it is possible that these orders could cannibalize more profitable in-restaurant visits or take-out orders. 
 We incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management devotes substantial time to new compliance initiatives. 
 We incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that our non-public competition does not incur. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ), as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, have imposed various requirements on public companies, including requiring certain corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. 
 In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In performing this evaluation and testing, both our management and our independent registered public accounting firm concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as of September 30, 2023. We are, however, addressing this issue and remediating our material weaknesses. When we were to identify a material weakness, correcting that issue, and thereafter our continued compliance with Section 404 require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. Moreover, if we are not able to correct an internal control issue and comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if in the future we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources. 
 We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, and concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. Management identified material weaknesses related to (1) proper design and implementation of controls over management's review of the Company's accounting for business combinations, specifically related to the identification of and accounting for, intangibles assets acquired in a business combination and over the precision of management's review of certain valuation assumptions; (2) the impairment of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles, and long-lived assets, specifically over the precision of management's review of certain assumptions; and (3) ineffective information technology general controls in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain information technology systems that support the Company's financial reporting processes. See Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, below. While certain actions have been taken to implement a remediation plan to address these material weaknesses and to enhance our internal control over financial reporting, if these material weaknesses are not remediated, it could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner, which could negatively affect investor confidence in our Company, and, as a result, the value of our common stock could be adversely affected.

 We may have uninsured risks in excess of our insurance coverage. 
 We maintain insurance in amounts we consider adequate for personal injury and property damage to which the business of the Company may be subject. However, there can be no assurance that uninsured liabilities in excess of the coverage provided by insurance, which liabilities may be imposed pursuant to the Texas dram shop statute or similar dram shop statutes or common law theories of liability in other states where we operate or expand. For example, the Texas dram shop statute provides a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to such person if it was apparent to the server that the individual being sold, served or provided with an alcoholic beverage was obviously intoxicated to the extent that he presented a clear danger to himself and others. An employer is not liable for the actions of its employee who over-serves if (i) the employer requires its employees to attend a seller training program approved by the TABC; (ii) the employee has actually attended such a training program; and (iii) the employer has not directly or indirectly encouraged the employee to violate the law. It is our policy to require that all servers of alcohol working at our clubs in Texas be certified as servers under a training program approved by the TABC, which certification gives statutory immunity to the sellers of alcohol from damage caused to third parties by those who have consumed alcoholic beverages at such establishment pursuant to the TABC. There can be no assurance, however, that uninsured liabilities may not arise in the markets in which we operate which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
 We are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us. 
 Increasing legal complexity will continue to affect our operations and results. We could be subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business, including class actions, administrative proceedings, government investigations, employment and personal injury claims, claims alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding consumer, workplace and employment matters, wage and hour claims, discrimination and similar matters, landlord/tenant disputes, disputes with current and former suppliers, claims by current and former franchisees, contractors, data privacy claims and intellectual property claims (including claims that we infringed upon another party s trademarks, or copyrights). Inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation which could result in significant judgments, including punitive and liquidated damages, and injunctive relief. 
 Occasionally, our guests file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury they suffered as a result of a visit to our restaurants, or that we have problems with food quality or operations. As a Company, we take responsible alcohol service seriously. However, we are subject to "dram shop" statutes. These statutes generally allow a person injured by an intoxicated person to recover damages from an establishment that served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. Some litigation against restaurant chains has resulted in significant judgments, including punitive damages, under dram shop statutes. Because a plaintiff may seek punitive damages, which may not be covered by insurance, this type of action could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Litigation involving our relationship with contractors and the legal distinction between our contractors and us for employment law purposes, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our operations and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. 
 Our operating results could also be affected by the following: 
 
 The relative level of our defense costs and nature and procedural status of pending proceedings; 
 
 The cost and other effects of settlements, judgments or consent decrees, which may require us to make disclosures or to take other actions that may affect perceptions of our brands and products; 
 
 Adverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition and preparation of our products, or the appropriateness or accuracy of our marketing or other communication practices; and 
 
 The scope and terms of insurance or indemnification protections that we may have (if any). 
 Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time, attention and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A judgment significantly in excess of any applicable insurance coverage could have significant adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from these claims may hurt our business.

 Our previous liability insurer may be unable to provide coverage to us and our subsidiaries. 
 As previously reported, the Company and its subsidiaries were insured under a liability policy issued by Indemnity Insurance Corporation, RRG IIC through October 25, 2013. The Company and its subsidiaries changed insurance companies on that date. 
 On November 7, 2013, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware entered a Rehabilitation and Injunction Order Rehabilitation Order ), which declared IIC impaired, insolvent and in an unsafe condition and placed IIC under the supervision of the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Delaware Commissioner in her capacity as receiver Receiver ). The Rehabilitation Order empowered the Commissioner to rehabilitate IIC through a variety of means, including gathering assets and marshaling those assets, as necessary. Further, the order stayed or abated pending lawsuits involving IIC as the insurer until May 6, 2014. 
 On April 10, 2014, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware entered a Liquidation and Injunction Order With Bar Date Liquidation Order ), which ordered the liquidation of IIC and terminated all insurance policies or contracts of insurance issued by IIC. The Liquidation Order further ordered that all claims against IIC must have been filed with the Receiver before the close of business on January 16, 2015 and that all pending lawsuits involving IIC as the insurer were further stayed or abated until October 7, 2014. As a result, the Company and its subsidiaries no longer had insurance coverage under the liability policy with IIC. The Company has retained counsel to defend against and evaluate these claims and lawsuits. We are funding 100 of the costs of litigation and will seek reimbursement from the bankruptcy receiver. The Company filed the appropriate claims against IIC with the Receiver before the January 16, 2015 deadline and has provided updates as requested; however, there are no assurances of any recovery from these claims. It is unknown at this time what effect this uncertainty will have on the Company. As previously stated, since October 25, 2013, the Company obtained general liability coverage from other insurers, which have covered and/or will cover any claims arising from actions after that date. As of September 30, 2023, we have 1 remaining unresolved claim out of the original 71 claims. 
 The protection provided by our service marks is limited. 
 Our rights to the trade names RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc., Rick s, Rick s Cabaret, Tootsie s Cabaret, Club Onyx, XTC Cabaret, Temptations, Jaguars, Downtown Cabaret, Cabaret East, Bombshells Restaurant and Bar, Vee Lounge, Mile High Men s Club, Country Rock Cabaret, PT s, and Diamond Cabaret are established under common law, based upon our substantial and continuous use of these trade names in interstate commerce, some of which have been in use at least as early as 1987. We have registered our service mark, RICK S AND STARS DESIGN, and the BOMBSHELLS RESTAURANT BAR logo design with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We have also obtained service mark registrations from the Patent and Trademark Office for RICK S AND STARS DESIGN logo, RCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC., RICK S, RICK S CABARET, CLUB ONYX, XTC CABARET, SCARLETT S CABARET, SILVER CITY CABARET, BOMBSHELLS RESTAURANT AND BAR, THE SEVILLE CLUB, DOWN IN TEXAS SALOON, HOOPS CABARET, VEE LOUNGE, STUDIO 80, FOXY S CABARET, EXOTIC DANCER, TOYS FOR TATAS, MILE HIGH MEN S CLUB, MHMC logo, AFTER DARK, COUNTRY ROCK CABARET, PT S, DIAMOND CABARET, "CABARET ROYALE," BABY DOLLS SALOON," "BABY DOLLS TOPLESS SALOON," "BABY DOLLS," "JAGUARS," and BOMBSHELLS OFFICER S CLUB are registered through service mark registrations issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. As of this date, we have pending registration applications for the names TOOTSIES CABARET, "RICK'S REWARDS," "VENICE CABARET," CHERRY CREEK FOOD HALL AND BREWERY , and THE MANSION. We also own the rights to numerous trade names associated with our media division. There can be no assurance that these steps we have taken to protect our service marks will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our protected intellectual property rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to protect our rights from infringement, which may be costly and time consuming. The loss of the intellectual property rights owned or claimed by us could have a material adverse effect on our business.

 We are dependent on key personnel. 
 Our future success is dependent, in a large part, on retaining the services of Eric Langan, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Bradley Chhay, our Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Langan possesses a unique and comprehensive knowledge of our industry. While Mr. Langan has no present plans to leave or retire in the near future, his loss could have a negative effect on our operating, marketing and financial performance if we are unable to find an adequate replacement with similar knowledge and experience within our industry. Mr. Chhay possesses thorough familiarity with our accounting system and how it affects our operations. Mr. Chhay is also vital in our due diligence efforts when acquiring clubs. We maintain key-man life insurance with respect to Mr. Langan but not for Mr. Chhay. Although Messrs. Langan and Chhay have signed employment agreements with us (as described herein), there can be no assurance that Mr. Langan or Mr. Chhay will continue to be employed by us. 
 If we are not able to hire, develop, and retain qualified club and restaurant employees and/or appropriately plan our workforce, our growth plan and profitability could be adversely affected. 
 We rely on our restaurant- and club-level employees to consistently provide high-quality food and positive experiences to our guests. In addition, our ability to continue to open new restaurants depends on us attracting, hiring, developing, and retaining high-quality managers. Maintaining appropriate staffing in our restaurants requires precise workforce planning, which planning has become more complex due to predictive scheduling laws (also called fair workweek or secure scheduling and just cause termination legislation in certain geographic areas where we operate, and the so-called great resignation trend. The market for qualified talent continues to be competitive and we must ensure that we continue to offer competitive wages, benefits, and workplace conditions to retain qualified employees. We have experienced and may continue to experience challenges in hiring and retaining restaurant and club employees and in maintaining full restaurant and or club staffing in various locations, which has resulted in longer wait times for guest orders and potentially decreased employee satisfaction. A shortage of qualified candidates who meet all legal work authorization and training requirements, failure to hire and retain new restaurant or club employees in a timely manner or higher than expected turnover levels could affect our ability to open new restaurants, grow sales at existing restaurants and clubs or meet our labor cost objectives. In addition, failure to adequately monitor and proactively respond to employee dissatisfaction could lead to poor guest satisfaction, higher turnover, litigation and unionization efforts, which could negatively impact our ability to meet our growth targets. 
 A failure to maintain food safety throughout the supply chain and food-borne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business. 
 Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that our guests enjoy safe, quality food products. However, food safety issues could be caused at the point of source or by food suppliers or distributors and, as a result, be out of our control. In addition, regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illnesses such as E. coli, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella, and other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination, at one of our restaurants or clubs could adversely affect the reputation of our brands and have a negative impact on our sales. Even instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our sales. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs and lower margins. 
 Our venture, expansion, and renovation projects may face significant inherent risks. 
 Investment in certain projects we may undertake will be subject to the many risks inherent in the expansion or renovation of an existing enterprise or construction of a new enterprise, including unanticipated design, construction, regulatory, environmental and operating problems and lack of demand for our projects. 
 Our current and future projects could also experience: 
 delays and significant cost increases; 
 delays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals; 
 lack of sufficient, or delays in the availability of, financing;

 poor performance or nonperformance by any third parties on whom we place reliance; 
 unforeseen construction scheduling, engineering, environmental, permitting, construction or geological problems, including defective plans and specifications; 
 weather interference, floods, fires or other casualty losses; and 
 COVID-19 related delays. 
 The completion dates of any of our projects could differ significantly from expectations for construction-related or other reasons. Actual costs and construction periods for any of our projects can differ significantly from initial expectations. Our initial project costs and construction periods are based upon budgets, conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared at inception of the project in consultation with architects and contractors. Many of these costs can increase over time as the project is built to completion. 
 We can provide no assurance that any project will be completed on time, if at all, or within established budgets, or that any project will result in increased earnings to us. Significant delays, cost overruns, or failures of our projects to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Other risk factors may adversely affect our financial performance. 
 Other risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements by affecting, among many things, pricing, consumer spending and consumer confidence, include, without limitation, changes in economic conditions and financial and credit markets, credit availability, increased fuel costs and availability for our employees, customers and suppliers, health epidemics or pandemics or the prospects of these events (such as reports on avian flu or COVID-19), consumer perceptions of food safety, changes in consumer tastes and behaviors, governmental monetary policies, changes in demographic trends, terrorist acts, energy shortages and rolling blackouts, and weather (including, major hurricanes and regional snow storms) and other acts of God. 
 We are also subject to the general risks of inflation, increases in minimum wage, health care, and other benefits that may have a material adverse effect on our cost structure, and the disruption in our supply chain caused by several factor, including the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Risk related to our common stock 
 We must continue to meet NASDAQ Global Market Continued Listing Requirements, or we risk delisting. 
 Our securities are currently listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market. We must continue to satisfy NASDAQ s continued listing requirements or risk delisting which would have an adverse effect on our business. If our securities are ever delisted from NASDAQ, they may trade on the over-the-counter market, which may be a less liquid market. In such case, our shareholders ability to trade or obtain quotations of the market value of shares of our common stock would be severely limited because of lower trading volumes and transaction delays. These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our securities. 
 We may be subject to allegations, defamations, or other detrimental conduct by third parties, which could harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers and/or contribute to a deflation of our stock price. 
 We have been subject to allegations by third parties or purported former employees, negative internet postings, and other adverse public exposure on our business, operations and staff compensation. We may also become the target of defamations or other detrimental conduct by third parties or disgruntled former or current employees. Such conduct may include complaints, anonymous or otherwise, to regulatory agencies, media or other organizations. We may be subject to government or regulatory investigation or other proceedings as a result of such third-party conduct and may be required to spend significant time and incur substantial costs to address such third-party conduct, and there is no assurance that we will be able to conclusively refute each of the allegations within a reasonable period of time, or at all. Any government or 
 19 

Table of Contents 

 regulatory investigations initiated as a result of the above may cause a deflation in our stock price. Additionally, allegations, directly or indirectly against us, may be posted on the internet, including social media platforms by anyone, whether or not related to us, on an anonymous basis. Any negative publicity on us or our management can be quickly and widely disseminated. Social media platforms and devices immediately publish the content of their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. Information posted may be inaccurate and adverse to us, and it may harm our reputation, business or prospects. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. Our reputation may be negatively affected as a result of the public dissemination of negative and potentially false information about our business and operations, which in turn may cause us to lose customers. 
 Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to seasonality and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, resulting in a decline in our stock price. 
 Our nightclub operations are affected by seasonal factors. Historically, we have experienced reduced revenues from April through September with the strongest operating results occurring from October through March. As a result, our quarterly and annual operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality and the factors discussed above. Accordingly, results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other fiscal quarter or for any fiscal year and same-store sales for any particular future period may decrease. In the future, operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the price of our common stock would likely decrease. 
 Anti-takeover effects of the issuance of our preferred stock could adversely affect our common stock. 
 Our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to fix the number of shares constituting any such series, and to fix the rights and preferences of the shares constituting any series, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock by the board of directors could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock. For example, such issuance could result in a class of securities outstanding that would have preferences with respect to voting rights and dividends and in liquidation over the common stock, and could (upon conversion or otherwise) enjoy all of the rights appurtenant to common stock. The Board s authority to issue preferred stock could discourage potential takeover attempts and could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company through merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise by making such attempts more difficult to achieve or costlier. There are no issued and outstanding shares of preferred stock; there are no agreements or understandings for the issuance of preferred stock; and the board of directors has no present intention to issue preferred stock. 
 Future sales or the perception of future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress our stock price. 
 The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or as a result of the perception that these sales could occur. In addition, these factors could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock. 
 Our stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future. 
 The trading price of our securities may fluctuate significantly. This price may be influenced by many factors, including: 
 our performance and prospects; 
 the depth and liquidity of the market for our securities; 
 investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate; 
 changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts; 
 general financial and other market conditions; and 
 domestic economic conditions.

 Public stock markets have experienced, and may experience, extreme price and trading volume volatility. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our securities. 
 Cumulative voting is not available to our stockholders. 
 Cumulative voting in the election of Directors is expressly denied in our Articles of Incorporation. Accordingly, the holder or holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock may elect all of our Directors. 
 Our directors and officers have limited liability and have rights to indemnification. 
 Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws provide, as permitted by governing Texas law, that our directors and officers shall not be personally liable to us or any of our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer, with certain exceptions. The Articles further provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers against expenses and liabilities they incur to defend, settle, or satisfy any civil litigation or criminal action brought against them on account of their being or having been its directors or officers unless, in such action, they are adjudged to have acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct. 
 The inclusion of these provisions in the Articles may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breach of their duty of care, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited us and our stockholders. 
 The Articles provide for the indemnification of our officers and directors, and the advancement to them of expenses in connection with any proceedings and claims, to the fullest extent permitted by Texas law. The Articles include related provisions meant to facilitate the indemnitee s receipt of such benefits. These provisions cover, among other things: (i) specification of the method of determining entitlement to indemnification and the selection of independent counsel that will in some cases make such determination, (ii) specification of certain time periods by which certain payments or determinations must be made and actions must be taken, and (iii) the establishment of certain presumptions in favor of an indemnitee. 
 Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.

 Our property leases are typically for a fixed rental rate with contingent rent for certain locations. The lease terms generally have initial terms of 10 to 20 years with renewal terms of 5 to 20 years. At September 30, 2023, certain of the properties we own were collateral for mortgage debt amounting to approximately 136.1 million. We believe that our existing facilities, both owned and leased, are in good condition and adequate and suitable for the conduct of our business.

 Stock Performance Graph 
 The following chart compares the five-year cumulative total stock performance of our common stock; the NASDAQ Composite Index (IXIC); the Russell 2000 Index (RUT); and the Dow Jones U.S. Restaurant Bar Index (DJUSRU), our peer index. The graph assumes a hypothetical investment of 100 on September 30, 2018 in each of our common stock and each of the indices, and that all dividends were reinvested. The measurement points utilized in the graph consist of the last trading day as of September 30 each year, representing the last day of our fiscal year. The calculations exclude trading commissions and taxes. We have selected the Dow Jones U.S. Restaurant Bar Index as our peer index since it represents a broader group of restaurant and bar operators that are more aligned to our core business operations. RICK is a component of the NASDAQ Composite Index and the Russell 2000 Index. The historical stock performance presented below is not intended to and may not be indicative of future stock performance.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A is intended to help the reader understand RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc., our operations and our present business environment. MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. This overview summarizes the MD A, which includes the following sections: 
 Our Business a general description of our business and the adult nightclub industry, our objective, our strategic priorities, our core capabilities, and challenges and risks of our business. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates. 
 Operations Review an analysis of our Company s consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources an analysis of cash flows, aggregate contractual obligations, and an overview of financial position. 
 
 OUR BUSINESS 
 The following are our operating segments: 
 Nightclubs Our wholly-owned subsidiaries own and/or operate upscale adult nightclubs serving primarily businessmen and professionals. These nightclubs are in Houston, Austin, San Antonio, Dallas, Fort Worth, Beaumont, Longview, Harlingen, Edinburg, Tye, Lubbock, Round Rock, El Paso and Odessa, Texas; Denver, Colorado; Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina; Minneapolis, Minnesota; New York and Newburgh, New York; Miami Gardens, Pembroke Park and Miami, Florida; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Phoenix, Arizona; Louisville, Kentucky; Portland, Maine; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Washington Park, Kappa, Sauget and Chicago, Illinois. No sexual contact is permitted at any of our locations. We also own and operate a Studio 80 dance club in Fort Worth, Texas. We also own and lease to third parties real properties that are adjacent to (or used to be locations of) our clubs. 
 Bombshells Our wholly-owned subsidiaries own and operate restaurants and sports bars in Houston, Dallas, Austin, Spring, Pearland, Tomball, Katy, Arlington, and San Antonio, Texas under the brand name Bombshells Restaurant Bar. Bombshells also operates a food hall in Denver, Colorado. 
 Other Our wholly-owned subsidiaries own a media division Media Group ), including the leading trade magazine serving the multibillion-dollar adult nightclubs industry and the adult retail products industry. We also own an industry trade show, an industry trade publication and more than a dozen industry and social media websites. Included here is Drink Robust, which is licensed to sell Robust Energy Drink in the United States. 
 We generate our revenues from the sale of liquor, beer, wine, food, and merchandise; service revenues such as cover charges, membership fees, and facility use fees; and other revenues such as commissions from vending and ATM machines, real estate rental, valet parking, and other products and services for both nightclub and restaurant/sports bar operations. Other revenues include Media Group revenues for the sale of advertising content and revenues from our annual Expo convention, and Drink Robust sales. Our fiscal year-end is September 30.

Table of Contents 

 Same-Store Sales. We calculate same-store sales by comparing year-over-year revenues from nightclubs and restaurants/sports bars starting in the first full quarter of operations after at least 12 full months for Nightclubs and at least 18 full months for Bombshells. We consider the first six months of operations of a Bombshells unit to be the honeymoon period where sales are significantly higher than normal. We exclude from a particular month s calculation units previously included in the same-store sales base that have closed temporarily for more than 15 days until its next full quarter of operations. We also exclude from the same-store sales base units that are being reconcepted or are closed due to renovations or remodels. Acquired units are included in the same-store sales calculation as long as they qualify based on the definitions stated above. Revenues outside of our Nightclubs and Bombshells reportable segments core business are excluded from same-store sales calculation. 
 Our goal is to use our Company s assets our brands, financial strength, and the talent and strong commitment of our management and employees to become more competitive and to accelerate growth. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates are based on management s historical and industry experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On a regular basis, we evaluate these accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from our estimates, and such differences could be material. 
 A full discussion of our significant accounting policies is contained in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, which is included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial results. These estimates require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments because they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our Audit Committee. 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 We review long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business, and significant negative industry or economic trends. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining useful life of the primary asset included in the asset group. If the asset group is not recoverable, the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. We define our asset group as an operating club or restaurant location, which is also our reporting unit or the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified. Key estimates in the undiscounted cash flow model include management s estimate of the projected revenues and operating margins. If fair value is used to determine an impairment loss, an additional key assumption is the selection of a weighted-average cost of capital to discount cash flows. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated. During the third quarter of 2023, we impaired one property for 58,000 for its property and equipment and 1.0 million for its operating lease right-of-use asset before the club's permanent closure. During the third quarter of 2022, we impaired two properties for a total of 1.0 million one due to eminent domain by the state of Texas and the other due to underperformance. During the second quarter of 2021, we impaired one property that was reclassified to assets held for sale for 1.4 million, and during the fourth quarter of 2021, we impaired four clubs for 584,000. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we also recognized software impairments amounting to 814,000 related to two venture projects.

 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
 Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are tested annually for impairment during our fourth fiscal quarter and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. 
 Our impairment calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate fair values. If our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to impairments that could be material. We do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a change in the estimates or assumptions we used that could cause a material change in our calculated impairment charges. 
 For our goodwill impairment review, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. This assessment is based on several factors, including industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, including an assessment of cash flows in comparison to actual and projected results of prior periods. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value based on our qualitative analysis, or if we elect to skip this step, we perform a Step 1 quantitative analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value is determined using market-related valuation models, including discounted cash flows and comparable asset market values. Key estimates in the discounted cash flow model include management s estimate of the projected revenues and operating margins, along with the selection of a weighted-average cost of capital to discount cash flows. We recognize goodwill impairment in the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit, based on the results of our Step 1 analysis. For the year ended September 30, 2023, we identified four reporting units that were impaired and recognized a total goodwill impairment of 4.2 million. For the year ended September 30, 2022, we identified one reporting unit that was impaired and recognized a goodwill impairment loss of 566,000. For the year ended September 30, 2021, we identified seven reporting units that were impaired and recognized a goodwill impairment loss totaling 6.3 million. 
 For indefinite- and definite-lived intangibles, specifically SOB licenses, we determine fair value by estimating the multiperiod excess earnings of the asset with key assumptions being similar to those used in the goodwill impairment valuation model. For indefinite-lived tradename, we determine fair value by using the relief from royalty method. The fair value is then compared to the carrying value and an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. We recorded impairment charges for SOB licenses amounting to 6.5 million in 2023 related to eight clubs, 293,000 in 2022 related to one club, and 5.3 million in 2021 related to three clubs. 
 Business Combinations 
 The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires the recognition of acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities at their acquisition date fair values. These fair values are a result of valuation techniques that use significant assumptions that are subject to a high degree of judgment. The excess of the acquisition price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Results of operations related to acquired entities are included prospectively beginning with the date of acquisition. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. 
 Stock-based Compensation 
 We recognize expense for stock-based compensation awards, which is equal to the fair value of the awards at grant date, ratably in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income over their requisite service period. Calculating the grant date fair value of stock-based compensation awards requires the input of subjective assumptions. We determine the fair value of each stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with assumptions based primarily on historical data. Specific inputs to the model include the expected term of the stock options, stock price volatility, dividend yield, and risk-free interest rate. 
 We used our historical exercise and post-vesting expiration behavior of grantees on stock options awarded prior to the 2022 Plan which may not be reflective of current stock market environment and current mix of grantees. We estimated expected volatility based on historical volatility of the Company's stock price for a period equal to the award's expected term. We estimated expected dividend yield based on the current dividend payout activity and the exercise price (that is, the expected dividends that would likely be reflected in an amount at which the stock option would be exchanged). The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. We recognize forfeitures when they occur.

 Income Taxes 
 We estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes including the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and book carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. These estimates include depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes, allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on employee tip income, effective rates for state and local income taxes, and the deductibility of certain other items, among others. We adjust our annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available. When necessary, we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to a balance that is more likely than not to be realized. 
 Legal and Other Contingencies 
 As mentioned in Item 3 Legal Proceedings and in a more detailed discussion in Note 1 0 to our consolidated financial statements, we are involved in various suits and claims in the normal course of business. We record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility that we may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations, the Company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In matters where there is insurance coverage, in the event we incur any liability, we believe it is unlikely we would incur losses in connection with these claims in excess of our insurance coverage.

 Revenues 
 Consolidated revenues increased by 26.2 million, or 9.8 , from 2022 to 2023 due mainly from newly acquired locations partially offset by a decrease in same-store sales and a sales decrease from locations closed in 2023. From 2021 to 2022, consolidated revenues increased by 72.4 million, or 37.1 , due to increases in same-store sales, newly acquired and constructed locations, and from locations closed in 2021 and reopened in 2022.

 No new Bombshells location was opened in 2021. Bombshells Arlington was opened in the first quarter of 2022. Bombshells San Antonio was acquired from our franchisee in the second quarter of 2023. We also acquired a food hall in Greenwood Village, Colorado during the first quarter of 2023. 
 Other segment revenues. Other revenues included revenues from Drink Robust in all three fiscal years presented. Drink Robust sales were 145,000, 201,000, and 249,000 in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, which exclude intercompany sales to Nightclubs and Bombshells units amounting to 254,000, 261,000, and 141,000 in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Media business revenues were 1.1 million, 1.2 million, and 1.0 million in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Total operating expenses, as a percent of consolidated revenues, were 82.5 , 73.3 , and 80.3 for the fiscal year 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Significant contributors to the change in operating expenses as a percent of revenues are explained below. 
 Cost of goods sold . Cost of goods sold includes cost of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, food, cigars and cigarettes, merchandise, media printing/binding, and Drink Robust. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, consolidated cost of goods sold was 13.3 , 13.5 , and 15.4 for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. See page 31 above for the breakdown of percentages for each line item of consolidated cost of goods sold as it relates to the respective consolidated revenue line. For the Nightclubs segment, cost of goods sold was 11.1 , 10.5 , and 11.8 for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, which was primarily caused by shifts in sales mix among the three fiscal years. Bombshells cost of goods sold was 22.4 , 23.5 , and 23.8 for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, which was mainly driven by menu price increases in 2023 and 2022 in response to inflation, and the shift in sales mix to lower-margin food sales in 2021. 
 Salaries and wages . Consolidated salaries and wages increased by 11.1 million, or 16.1 , from 2022 to 2023 and increased by 17.8 million, or 35.2 , from 2021 to 2022. The dollar increases are mostly from newly acquired or constructed locations. As a percentage of revenues, consolidated salaries and wages were 27.1 , 25.6 , and 25.9 in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, mainly due to sales trend and the impact of fixed salaries on change in sales.

 The significant variances in selling, general and administrative expenses are as follows: 
 As a percentage of revenues, relatively fixed expenses tend to be higher in rate due to lower sales, while more variable expenses tend to keep their rates even if dollar amounts are increasing. Nightclubs expenses increased as a percentage of segment revenue due to newly acquired clubs. Bombshells expenses increased as a percentage of segment revenue due to lower sales. 
 Depreciation and amortization . Depreciation and amortization increased by 2.8 million, or 22.3 , from 2022 to 2023 and increased by 4.2 million, or 50.4 , from 2021 to 2022. The increase from 2021 to 2022 was mainly caused by the growth in our depreciable asset base and amortizable intangibles caused by acquired clubs and a new Bombshells unit, while the increase from 2022 to 2023 was mainly from newly acquired clubs. 
 Other charges, net . The components of other charges, net are in the table below (dollars in thousands):

The rest of the claims for the Sulphur club were received in 2022. Gains related to insurance recoveries are recognized when the contingencies related to the insurance claims have been resolved, which may be in a subsequent reporting period. See Note 1 3 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Income from Operations 
 During fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, our consolidated operating margin was 17.5 , 26.7 , and 19.7 , respectively.

 Other Income/Expenses 
 Interest expense increased by approximately 4.0 million from 2022 to 2023 and by approximately 2.0 million from 2021 to 2022. The increase in interest expense was primarily caused by the significantly higher average debt balance from borrowings to finance our acquisitions. 
 We consider lease plus interest expense as our occupancy costs since most of our debts are for real properties where our clubs and restaurants are located. For occupancy cost purposes, we exclude non-real-estate-related interest expense. Total occupancy cost rate (total occupancy cost as a percentage of revenues) is shown in the table below. 
 2023 2022 2021 Lease 2.5 2.5 2.0 Interest 5.4 4.5 4.8 Total occupancy cost 7.9 7.0 6.8 
 The 2021 interest expense rate above excludes certain costs and charges related to the September 2021 Refinancing Note amounting to approximately 637,000, or 0.3 of consolidated revenues. The 637,000 interest expense includes 103,000 in unamortized debt issuance costs that were written off and 228,000 in expensed new loan costs. 
 In fiscal 2021, we received 11 notices of forgiveness for our PPP loans approving the forgiveness of 100 of each of the 11 PPP loans amounting to 5.3 million in principal and interest, which were included in non-operating gains (losses), net.

 Income tax expense was approximately 6.8 million in 2023, 14.1 million in 2022, and 4.0 million in 2021. Our effective income tax rate was 19.0 in 2023, 23.4 expense in 2022, and 11.7 expense in 2021. The components of our annual effective income tax rate are the following: 
 2023 2022 2021 Federal statutory income tax expense/benefit 21.0 21.0 21.0 State income taxes, net of federal benefit 4.5 3.0 2.1 Permanent differences 1.7 0.2 (1.3) Change in tax rates (0.7) 1.5 (2.4) Change in valuation allowance (0.5) 0.6 (1.9) Tax credits (5.9) (3.0) (3.5) Other (1.0) 0.2 (2.4) Total effective income tax rate 19.0 23.4 11.7 
 The effective income tax rate difference from the statutory federal corporate tax rate of 21 comes from offsetting impact of state income tax, net of federal benefit, changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, and tax credits that are mostly FICA tip credits. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, within the meaning of the SEC Regulation G, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We monitor non-GAAP financial measures because it describes the operating performance of the Company and helps management and investors gauge our ability to generate cash flow, excluding (or including) some items that management believes are not representative of the ongoing business operations of the Company, but are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Relative to each of the non-GAAP financial measures, we further set forth our rationale as follows: 
 Non-GAAP Operating Income and Non-GAAP Operating Margin. We calculate non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin by excluding the following items from income from operations and operating margin: (a) amortization of intangibles, (b) impairment of assets, (c) gains or losses on sale of businesses and assets, (d) gains or losses on insurance, (e) settlement of lawsuits, (f) costs and charges related to debt refinancing, and (g) stock-based compensation. We believe that excluding these items assists investors in evaluating period-over-period changes in our operating income and operating margin without the impact of items that are not a result of our day-to-day business and operations. 
 Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Net Income per Diluted Share . We calculate non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share by excluding or including certain items to net income attributable to RCIHH common stockholders and diluted earnings per share. Adjustment items are: (a) amortization of intangibles, (b) impairment of assets, (c) gains or losses on sale of businesses and assets, (d) gains or losses on insurance, (e) unrealized loss on equity securities, (f) settlement of lawsuits, (g) gain on debt extinguishment, (h) costs and charges related to debt refinancing, (i) stock-based compensation, (j) the income tax effect of the above-described adjustments, and (k) change in deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Included in the income tax effect of the above adjustments is the net effect of the non-GAAP provision for income taxes, calculated at 20.6 , 22.8 , and 13.5 effective tax rate of the pre-tax non-GAAP income before taxes for the 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, and the GAAP income tax expense. We believe that excluding and including such items help management and investors better understand our operating activities.

 Adjusted EBITDA . We calculate adjusted EBITDA by excluding the following items from net income attributable to RCIHH common stockholders: (a) depreciation and amortization, (b) income tax expense (benefit), (c) net interest expense, (d) gains or losses on sale of businesses and assets, (e) gains or losses on insurance, (f) unrealized gains or losses on equity securities, (g) impairment of assets, (h) settlement of lawsuits, (i) gain on debt extinguishment, and (j) stock-based compensation. We believe that adjusting for such items helps management and investors better understand our operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA provides a core operational performance measurement that compares results without the need to adjust for federal, state and local taxes which have considerable variation between domestic jurisdictions. The results are, therefore, without consideration of financing alternatives of capital employed. We use adjusted EBITDA as one guideline to assess the unleveraged performance return on our investments. Adjusted EBITDA multiple is also used as a target benchmark for our acquisitions of nightclubs. 
 We also use certain non-GAAP cash flow measures such as free cash flow. See Liquidity and Capital Resources section for further discussion. 
 The following tables present our non-GAAP performance measures for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per share amounts and percentages):

 The adjustments to reconcile net income attributable to RCIHH common stockholders to non-GAAP net income exclude the impact of adjustments related to noncontrolling interests, which is immaterial. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 At September 30, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents were 21.0 million as compared to 36.0 million at September 30, 2022. Because of the large volume of cash we handle, we have very stringent cash controls. As of September 30, 2023, we had negative working capital of 10.5 million compared to a working capital of 18.6 million as of September 30, 2022, excluding net assets held for sale amounting to 0 and 1.0 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We believe that we can borrow capital if needed but currently we do not have unused credit facilities so there can be no guarantee that additional liquidity will be readily available or available on favorable terms. 
 We have not recently raised capital through the issuance of equity securities although we have used equity recently in our acquisitions. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on stockholders equity. We have a history of borrowing funds in private transactions and from sellers in acquisition transactions and have secured traditional bank financing on our new development projects and refinancing of our existing notes payable. There can be no assurance though that any of these financing options would be presently available on favorable terms, if at all. We also have historically utilized these cash flows to invest in property and equipment, adult nightclubs, and restaurants/sports bars. 
 During 2023, we acquired six clubs at an aggregate acquisition date fair value of 72.3 million, of which 29.0 million was in cash, 30.5 million in debt (with an acquisition date fair value of 30.4 million), and 16.0 million in equity (200,000 shares of our common stock with an acquisition date fair value of 12.8 million, discounted for lack of marketability due to the lock-up period). 
 During 2022, we acquired fifteen clubs at an aggregate acquisition date fair value of 132.6 million, of which 55.3 million was in cash, 49.0 million in debt (with an acquisition date fair value of 47.4 million) and 30.0 million in equity (500,000 shares of our common stock with an acquisition date fair value of 29.9 million, discounted for lack of marketability due to the lock-up period). 
 We expect to generate adequate cash flows from operations for the next 12 months from the issuance of this report. 
 The following table presents a summary of our net cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities (in thousands): 
 2023 2022 2021 Operating 59,130 64,509 41,991 Investing (64,824) (67,797) (6,814) Financing (9,263) 3,582 (15,096) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (14,957) 294 20,081 
 We require capital principally for the acquisition of new clubs, construction of new Bombshells, renovation of older units, and investments in technology. We also utilize capital to repurchase our common stock as part of our share repurchase program, based on our capital allocation strategy guidelines, and to pay our quarterly dividends.

 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Following are our summarized cash flows from operating activities (in thousands): 
 2023 2022 2021 Net income 29,100 46,060 30,150 Depreciation and amortization 15,151 12,391 8,238 Deferred tax expense (benefit) (1,781) 3,080 (1,253) Stock-based compensation expense 2,588 2,353 Impairment of assets 12,629 1,888 13,612 Gain on debt extinguishment (83) (5,298) Net change in operating assets and liabilities (1,203) (1,421) (3,451) Other 2,646 241 (7) Net cash provided by operating activities 59,130 64,509 41,991 
 Net cash flows from operating activities decreased from 2022 to 2023 mainly due to the lower same-store sales and the higher interest expense paid, partially offset by the lower income taxes paid. Net cash flows from operating activities increased from 2021 to 2022 mainly due to the operating results of the fifteen acquired clubs and one Bombshells opened. 
 In the next five years, we expect interest payments on our debts to range from 15.0 million in the early years to 8.0 million annually in the latter years for debts we owe as of September 30, 2023. 
 See Note 18 for our operating lease payment schedule for the next five years and thereafter. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Following are our summarized cash flows from investing activities (in thousands): 
 2023 2022 2021 Proceeds from sale of businesses and assets 4,245 10,669 5,415 Proceeds from notes receivable 229 182 130 Proceeds from insurance 86 648 1,152 Payments for property and equipment and intangible assets (40,384) (24,003) (13,511) Acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired (29,000) (55,293) Net cash used in investing activities (64,824) (67,797) (6,814) 
 In 2023, we acquired six clubs for a combined sum of 75.5 million (with an aggregate acquisition date fair value of 72.3 million), of which 29.0 million was in cash, 30.5 million in debt (with an acquisition date fair value of 30.4 million), and 200,000 shares of our common stock in equity (with an acquisition date fair value of 12.8 million). We also acquired several real estate properties for club and Bombshells sites totaling 19.7 million, and invested 7.5 million for future casino locations. 
 In 2022, we acquired fifteen clubs for a combined sum of 134.2 million (with an aggregate acquisition date fair value of 132.6 million), of which 55.3 million was in cash, 49.0 million in debt (with an acquisition date fair value of 47.4 million), and 500,000 shares of our common stock in equity (with an acquisition date fair value of 29.9 million). We also purchased an aircraft and six real estate properties, of which, four are for future Bombshells locations, one for a club that we were leasing, and another to replace a club location which was taken by eminent domain. Also in 2022, we received payment for four real estate properties. We did not receive payment for the eminent domain property mentioned above until November 2022. In 2021, we acquired four real estate properties either for future club or restaurant locations or for corporate use. On one of the real properties purchased, we opened a Bombshells restaurant on December 6, 2021 in Arlington, Texas. There were no new Bombshells units opened in 2021. We also sold two real estate properties in 2021. We opened two new Bombshells units in 2020 (one in Katy, Texas and another on U.S. Highway 59 in Houston, Texas) and sold three real estate properties.

Table of Contents 

 As of September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we had 7.7 million, 1.5 million, and 3.4 million in construction-in-progress related mostly to Bombshells opening in the subsequent fiscal years. 
 See Note 1 4 to our consolidated financial statements for details of our acquisition and disposition activities. 
 Following is a reconciliation of our additions to property and equipment for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 (in thousands): 
 2023 2022 2021 New capital expenditures in new clubs and Bombshells units and equipment 34,430 18,405 7,604 Maintenance capital expenditures 5,954 5,598 5,907 Total capital expenditures, excluding business acquisitions 40,384 24,003 13,511 
 Includes real estate except those acquired through business acquisitions. 
 We expect capital expenditure payments in the range of 35.0 million to 40.0 million in 2024, 6.0 million to 8.0 million of which relate to maintenance capital expenditures to support our existing clubs and restaurants and our corporate office. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Following are our summarized cash flows from financing activities (in thousands): 
 2023 2022 2021 Proceeds from debt obligations 11,595 35,820 38,490 Payments on debt obligations (15,650) (14,894) (49,178) Purchase of treasury stock (2,223) (15,097) (1,794) Payment of dividends (2,146) (1,784) (1,440) Payment of loan origination costs (239) (463) (1,174) Distribution to noncontrolling interests (600) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (9,263) 3,582 (15,096) 
 See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our debt obligations, including the future maturities of our debt obligations in the next five years and thereafter. 
 We purchased shares of our common stock representing 34,086 shares, 268,185 shares, and 74,659 shares in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. We paid quarterly dividends of 0.04 per share in fiscal 2021 through the first quarter of 2022. In the second quarter of 2022 through the first quarter of 2023, we increased our quarterly dividends to 0.05 per share. Then starting in the second quarter of 2023, we increased our quarterly dividends to 0.06 per share. We expect annual dividend payments of 2.2 million in 2024 based on our current quarterly dividend rate. 
 Non-GAAP Cash Flow Measure 
 We also use certain non-GAAP cash flow measures, such as free cash flow. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less maintenance capital expenditures. We use free cash flow as the baseline for the implementation of our capital allocation strategy. See table below (in thousands): 
 2023 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities 59,130 64,509 41,991 Less: Maintenance capital expenditures 5,954 5,598 5,907 Free cash flow 53,176 58,911 36,084 As a of revenue 18.1 22.0 18.5 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 We do not include total capital expenditures as a reduction from net cash flow from operating activities to arrive at free cash flow. This is because, based on our capital allocation strategy, acquisitions and development of our own clubs and restaurants are our primary uses of free cash flow. 
 Other than the impact of uncertainties caused by near-term macro environment, including commodity and labor inflation and the lingering effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the contractual obligations described above, we are not aware of any event or trend that would adversely impact our liquidity. In our opinion, working capital is not a true indicator of our financial status. Typically, businesses in our industry carry current liabilities in excess of current assets because businesses in our industry receive substantially immediate payment for sales, with nominal receivables, while inventories and other current liabilities normally carry longer payment terms. Vendors and purveyors often remain flexible with payment terms, providing businesses in our industry with opportunities to adjust to short-term business downturns. We consider the primary indicators of financial status to be the long-term trend of revenue growth, the mix of sales revenues, overall cash flow, profitability from operations and the level of long-term debt. We continue to monitor the macro environment and will adjust our overall approach to capital allocation as events and trends unfold. 
 The following table presents a summary of such indicators (dollars in thousands): 
 2023 Inc (Dec) 2022 Inc (Dec) 2021 Sales of alcoholic beverages 127,262 12.3 113,316 30.7 86,685 Sales of food and merchandise 43,906 (0.9) 44,294 7.7 41,111 Service revenues 103,577 10.3 93,888 69.3 55,461 Other revenues 19,045 18.1 16,122 34.3 12,001 Total revenues 293,790 9.8 267,620 37.1 195,258 Net income attributable to RCIHH common stockholders 29,246 (36.5) 46,041 51.8 30,336 Net cash provided by operating activities 59,130 (8.3) 64,509 53.6 41,991 Adjusted EBITDA 84,998 (2.0) 86,724 44.0 60,243 Free cash flow 53,176 (9.7) 58,911 63.3 36,084 Debt (end of period) 239,751 18.4 202,463 61.8 125,168 
 See definition and calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow under Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Liquidity and Capital Resources above. 
 We have not established financing other than the notes payable discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on reasonable terms in the future, if at all, should the need arise. 
 Share Repurchase 
 As part of our capital allocation strategy, we buy back shares in the open market or through negotiated purchases, as authorized by our board of directors. During fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, we paid for treasury stock amounting to 2.2 million, 15.1 million, and 1.8 million, representing 34,086 shares, 268,185 shares, and 74,659 shares, respectively. On May 24, 2022, the board of directors approved a 25.0 million increase in the Company's share repurchase program. We have approximately 16.6 million remaining to purchase additional shares as of September 30, 2023. 
 For additional details regarding our Board approved share repurchase plans, please refer to Item 5 Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. 
 
 IMPACT OF INFLATION 
 To the extent permitted by competition, we have managed to recover increased costs through price increases and may continue to do so. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future.

 SEASONALITY 
 Our nightclub operations are affected by seasonal factors. Historically, we have experienced reduced revenues from April through September (our fiscal third and fourth quarters) with the strongest operating results occurring during October through March (our fiscal first and second quarters). Our revenues in certain markets are also affected by sporting events that cause unusual changes in sales from year to year. 
 
 GROWTH STRATEGY 
 We believe that we can continue to grow organically and through careful entry into markets with high growth potential. Our growth strategy includes acquiring existing clubs, opening new clubs after market analysis, developing new club concepts that are consistent with our management and marketing skills, franchising our Bombshells brand, and developing and opening our Bombshells concept as our capital and manpower allow. We also strive to enter into businesses that complement our own, such as gaming, if they can enhance shareholder value. 
 All twelve of the existing Bombshells as of September 30, 2023 are located in Texas. Our food hall, which is currently being operated under our Bombshells segment, is located in Colorado. Our growth strategy is to diversify our operations with these units which do not require SOB licenses, which are sometimes difficult to obtain. While we are searching for adult nightclubs to acquire, we are able to also search for restaurant/sports bar locations that are consistent with our income targets. 
 Recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, we did not acquire any clubs nor open any new Bombshells units in 2021. 
 In 2022, we acquired fifteen clubs with an aggregate acquisition date fair value of 132.6 million, of which 55.3 million in cash, 49.0 million in debt (with an acquisition date fair value of 47.4 million), and 500,000 shares of our common stock in equity. We also opened a new Bombshells location in Arlington, Texas in December 2021 and our first franchised location in San Antonio, Texas opened in June 2022. 
 In 2023, we acquired six clubs with an aggregate acquisition date fair value of 72.3 million, of which 29.0 million was in cash, 30.5 million in debt (with an acquisition date fair value of 30.4 million), and 200,000 shares of our common stock in equity. 
 See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire new nightclubs and anticipate acquiring new locations that fit our business model as we have done in the past. The acquisition of additional clubs may require us to take on additional debt or issue our common stock, or both. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on reasonable terms in the future, if at all, should the need arise. An inability to obtain such additional financing could have an adverse effect on our growth strategy. 
 
 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The items in our financial statements subject to market risk are potential debt instruments with variable interest rates. We have certain debts that have variable interest rates in effect as of September 30, 2023. An increase in interest rates in the future may have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. A hypothetical 10 change in interest rates would have had a 680,000 impact on the Company's annual results of operations and cash flows.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of 
 RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc. 
 Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc. (the Company as of September 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, changes in equity, and cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes and schedule (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013 and our report dated December 14, 2023, expressed an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting because of the existence of material weaknesses. 
 Basis for Opinion

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 Impairment of Goodwill, Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets, and Long-lived Assets 
 As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company reviews goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis for impairment, or when events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Additionally, the Company reviews long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, intangible assets subject to amortization, and right-of-use assets on operating leases for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The Company s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, and impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets is recognized in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceed their fair value. Recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset groups to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset groups. If these assets are 
 50 

Table of Contents 

 determined to be impaired, the amount of impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. Fair value is generally determined using forecasted cash flows discounted using an estimated weighted average cost of capital. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had goodwill of approximately 70.8 million, and indefinite-lived intangible assets of approximately 155.5 million. Long-lived assets consisted of property and equipment, right of use assets, and intangible assets subject to amortization totaling approximately 341.2 million. During the year ended September 30, 2023 the Company recorded an impairment of these assets of approximately 12.6 million. 
 We identified the evaluation of the impairment analysis of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, and long-lived assets as a critical audit matter. There was a high degree of subjective auditor judgment in evaluating the estimated undiscounted future cash flows used to test operating locations for recoverability and the determination of fair value of the relevant assets when required. Specifically, a high degree of subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate future revenues, operating cash flows and the discount rate. 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design of certain internal controls related to the Company s goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible asset, and long-lived asset impairment process, including controls over the identification of relevant assets at risk of impairment, the determination of estimated undiscounted future cash flows and the fair value of individual reporting unit or asset, as necessary, and controls over the key assumptions as noted above. These procedures also included, among others, (1) testing management s process for developing the fair value estimates of the reporting units or assets; (2) evaluating the appropriateness of the underlying discounted and undiscounted cash flow models; (3) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the models; and (4) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management, including the future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. Evaluating management s significant assumptions related to future cash flows, growth rates and the discount rates involved, with the assistance of valuation specialists, evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (1) the historical performance of the reporting unit or asset group; (2) the consistency with external market data; and (3) sensitivities over significant inputs and assumptions, including the development of a point estimate. 
 Fair Value Measurement of Consideration and, Tangible and Intangible Assets Acquired in Business Acquisitions 
 As described in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed two business acquisitions with an aggregate acquisition price totaling approximately 72.3 million during the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method, which requires recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The fair value of the tangible assets acquired were measured using adjusted market prices and/or cost models. The fair values of intangible assets acquired are typically estimated using an income approach, which is based on the present value of future discounted cash flows. Management applied significant judgment in estimating the fair value of the consideration and, tangible and intangible assets acquired, which involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the rate of future revenue growth, profitability of the acquired business and the discount rate, among other factors. In addition, the discount for lack of marketability applied to the common stock consideration was estimated based on an analysis of restricted stock studies, empirical data for discounts, and quantitative models. 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the fair value measurement of the consideration and assets acquired related to the acquisitions is a critical audit matter are (1) the significant judgment by management, including the use of specialists, when estimating the fair values of assets acquired; (2) a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in performing procedures relating to the fair value measurement of assets acquired; (3) the significant audit effort in evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions relating to the rate of future revenue growth and profitability of the acquired business and the discount rate; and (4) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included identifying and evaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management s valuation of the assets acquired and consideration, and controls over the development of the valuation models, as well as the significant assumptions related to the rate of future revenue growth, profitability of the acquired business, and the discount rate. These procedures also included, among others: (1) Reading the purchase agreement.; (2) Testing management s process for estimating the fair values of the net assets acquired. Testing management s process included evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation method, testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by 
 51 

Table of Contents 

 management, and evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to the rate of future revenue growth, profitability of the acquired business, and the discount rate. Evaluating the reasonableness of the rate of future revenue growth and the profitability of the acquired business involved considering the historical performance of the acquired businesses and market comparable information, as well as economic and industry forecasts. The reasonableness of the discount rate was evaluated by considering the cost of capital of comparable businesses and other industry factors.; (3) Developing an independent point estimate for the consideration.; and (4) Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models, the reasonableness of the discount rate, and evaluating the assumptions for the fair value of the assets. They also assisted us in developing an independent model and assumptions for the consideration.

For the year ended September 30, 2022, we identified reporting unit that was impaired and recognized a goodwill impairment loss of .

 , such as property and equipment, intangible assets subject to amortization, and right-of-use assets on operating leases for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business, and significant negative industry or economic trends. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining useful life of the primary asset included in the asset group. If the asset group is not recoverable, the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. We define our asset group as an operating club or restaurant location, which is also our reporting unit or the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated. For assets held for sale, we measure fair value using an estimation based on quoted prices for similar items in active or inactive markets (level 2) developed using observable data. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet. During fiscal 2023, the Company impaired club for ; during 2022, the Company impaired club and Bombshells for a total of million; and during fiscal 2021, the Company impaired clubs (including later reclassified as held for sale) for a total of million.

 operating subsidiaries of the Company to challenge a Texas Comptroller administrative rule related to the per customer Patron Tax Fee assessed against Sexually Oriented Businesses. An administrative rule attempted to expand the fee to cover venues featuring dancers using latex cover as well as traditional nude entertainment. The administrative rule was challenged on both constitutional and statutory grounds. On November 19, 2018, the Court issued an order that a key aspect of the administrative rule is invalid based on it exceeding the scope of the Comptroller s authority. On March 6, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, Austin Division, ruled that the Texas Patron Tax is unconstitutional as it has been applied and enforced by the Comptroller. The State of Texas appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, who affirmed that the Texas Patron Fee is unconstitutional as applied. The State of Texas next sought review from the Supreme Court, but the high court declined to take the case and in doing so exhausted the State's rights to appeal the judgment. The lawsuit was sent back to the trial court for post-trial proceedings, which resulted in the award of attorneys' fees to the operating subsidiaries. Pursuant to the rulings, the Texas Patron Fee is unconstitutional as applied to clubs featuring dancers using latex cover.

 On June 23, 2014, Mark H. Dupray and Ashlee Dupray filed a lawsuit against Pedro Antonio Panameno and our subsidiary JAI Dining Services (Phoenix) Inc. JAI Phoenix in the Superior Court of Arizona for Maricopa County. The suit alleged that Mr. Panameno injured Mr. Dupray in a traffic accident after being served alcohol at an establishment operated by JAI Phoenix. The suit alleged that JAI Phoenix was liable under theories of common law dram shop negligence and dram shop negligence per se. After a jury trial proceeded to a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs against both defendants, in April 2017 the Court entered a judgment under which JAI Phoenix s share of compensatory damages is approximately million and its share of punitive damages is million. In May 2017, JAI Phoenix filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, motion for new trial. The Court denied this motion in August 2017. In September 2017, JAI Phoenix filed a notice of appeal. In June 2018, the matter was heard by the Arizona Court of Appeals. On November 15, 2018 the Court of Appeals vacated the jury s verdict and remanded the case to the trial court. It is anticipated that a new trial will occur at some point in the future. JAI Phoenix will continue to vigorously defend itself. 
 As set forth in the risk factors as disclosed in this report, the adult entertainment industry standard is to classify adult entertainers as independent contractors, not employees. While we take steps to ensure that our adult entertainers are deemed independent contractors, from time to time, we are named in lawsuits related to the alleged misclassification of entertainers. Claims are brought under both federal and where applicable, state law. Based on the industry standard, the manner in which the independent contractor entertainers are treated at the clubs, and the entertainer license agreements governing the entertainer s work at the clubs, the Company believes that these lawsuits are without merit. Lawsuits are handled by attorneys with an expertise in the relevant law and are defended vigorously.

 General 
 In the regular course of business affairs and operations, we are subject to possible loss contingencies arising from third-party litigation and federal, state, and local environmental, labor, health and safety laws and regulations. We assess the probability that we could incur liability in connection with certain of these lawsuits. Our assessments are made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as codified in ASC 450-20, and is not an admission of any liability on the part of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. In certain cases that are in the early stages and in light of the uncertainties surrounding them, we do not currently possess sufficient information to determine a range of reasonably possible liability. In matters where there is insurance coverage, in the event we incur any liability, we believe it is unlikely we would incur losses in connection with these claims in excess of our insurance coverage.

 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. 
 There have been no disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure. 
 
 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In connection with the preparation of this report, an evaluation was carried out by certain members of Company management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer CEO and the Chief Financial Officer CFO of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Securities and Exchange Commission s SEC Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act as of September 30, 2023. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and the CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Due to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below, management concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2023. Notwithstanding the existence of these material weaknesses, management believes that the consolidated financial statements in this annual report filed on Form 10-K present, in all material respects, the Company s financial condition as reported, in conformity with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles U.S. GAAP ). 
 Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have identified material weaknesses in internal control related to (1) proper design and implementation of controls over management s review of the Company s accounting for business combinations, specifically related to the identification of and accounting for, intangible assets acquired in a business combination, and over the precision of management's review of certain valuation assumptions; (2) the impairment of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles, and long-lived assets, specifically over the precision of management's review of certain assumptions; and (3) ineffective information technology general controls (ITGCs") in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain information technology ("IT") systems that support the Company's financial reporting processes. Our business process controls (automated and manual) that are dependent on the affected ITGCs were also deemed ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted. We believe that these control deficiencies were a result of inadequate IT controls over the review of user access and imprecise documentation of procedures related to program change management. Additionally, we rely upon a variety of outsourced IT service providers for key elements of the technology infrastructure impacting our financial reporting process. Certain outsourced IT service providers could not provide System and Organization Controls ("SOC") reports for periods that closely align with our fiscal year end. Given 
 98 

Table of Contents 

 that management did not effectively assess the design and operation of these outsourced IT service providers internal controls, some of our controls over IT systems and business processes were also deemed ineffective, but only to the extent that we rely upon information that was subject to the outsourced IT service providers control environment. These deficiencies may have an impact on our financial statements, account balances, and disclosures. Based on our evaluation, our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2023. 
 Following identification of these material weaknesses, and prior to filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we completed substantive procedures for the year ended September 30, 2023. Based on these procedures, management believes that the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our CEO and CFO have certified that, based on their knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this Form 10-K, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented in this Form 10-K. 
 The Company s independent registered public accounting firm, Marcum LLP, has expressed an unqualified opinion on our financial statements and an adverse opinion on our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, in the audit report that appears at the end of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Remediation Plan for Existing Material Weaknesses 
 Review of Accounting for Business Combinations 
 Management is committed to the remediation of the material weakness described above. As such, controls will be added to both increase precision of management s review of each component of business combinations, and if necessary, retain the services of a third-party consultant to assist in the valuation and accounting for intangible assets acquired in a business combination. 
 Review of Accounting for Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
 As most of the assumptions used in the valuation models employed in impairment analyses are subjective in nature, Management will employ additional controls to validate these assumptions, including the engagement of a third-party consultant to assist developing valuation models and establishing sound and reasonable assumptions. 
 Information Technology General Controls 
 As a result of the material weakness, we have initiated and will continue to implement remediation measures to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions include: (i) strengthening and enhancing the review and documentation procedures in our controls over user access review; (ii) define and communicate clear and concise program change management policy and procedures; (iii) enhancing the reporting requirements of accounting system audit logs; (vi) continuous improvement over our ITGC controls related to third party applications; and (vi) enhanced quarterly reporting on the remediation measures to the Audit Committee of the board of directors. 
 It is our belief that these added controls will effectively remediate the existing material weaknesses. 
 We believe that these actions will remediate the material weaknesses. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated, however, until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We expect that the remediation of these material weaknesses will be completed prior to the end of fiscal 2024.

 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 During fiscal year 2023, the Company completed several business combinations as described in Note 14 - Acquisitions and Dispositions to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 On October 26, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of a club in Dickinson, Texas. 
 On March 16, 2023, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries completed the acquisition of five gentlemen's clubs, five related real estate properties, associated intellectual properties, and certain automated teller machines. 
 The scope of management s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures for fiscal year end 2023 did not include the internal control over the financial reporting of these acquisitions, in accordance with the SEC s staff guidance that permits exclusion of acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Due to the size, breadth and complexity of the acquisition of these businesses, management s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, did exclude those internal control activities. The businesses are wholly owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues are excluded from management s assessment and represent approximately 7 and 6 , respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 Except for the remediation efforts as discussed above, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses described in the following paragraph on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: 
 The Company had ineffective design, implementation and, operation of controls over program change management, user access and vendor management controls to ensure: 
 1) IT program and data changes affecting the Company s financial IT applications and underlying accounting records, are identified, tested, authorized, and implemented appropriately to validate that data produced by its relevant IT system(s) were complete and accurate. Automated process-level and manual controls that are dependent upon the information derived from such financially relevant systems were also determined to be ineffective as a result of such deficiency; 
 2) appropriate restrictions that would adequately prevent users from gaining inappropriate access to the financially relevant systems; 
 3) key third party service provider SOC reports were obtained and reviewed. 
 Ineffective design, implementation, and operation of controls, which include management review controls, over the accounting for business combinations. 
 Ineffective design, implementation, and operation of controls, which include management review controls, over the Company's assessments of potential impairment. 
 These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the fiscal 2023 consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule, and this report does not affect our report dated December 14, 2023 on those consolidated financial statements. 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2023 and the related consolidated statement of operations, changes in equity, and cash flows and the related financial statement schedule for the year ended September 30, 2023 of the Company and our report dated December 14, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule. 
 Explanatory Paragraph Excluded Subsidiaries 
 As described in Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting , management has excluded the Company s acquisition of two businesses that occurred during the year ended September 30, 2023, from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023 because these entities were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during the year ended September 30, 2023. We have also excluded these two businesses from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. These businesses are wholly owned subsidiaries whose 
 101

 combined total assets and total revenues represent approximately 7 and 6 , respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of the inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In addition, the order found that the Company failed to disclose related party transactions involving Mr. Langan s father and brother and a director s brother.

 COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
 AUDIT COMMITTEE 
 We have an Audit Committee whose members are Yura Barabash, Elaine Martin and Arthur Allan Priaulx. All members of the Audit Committee are independent directors. The purpose of the Audit Committee is to (i) oversee our accounting and financial reporting processes, our disclosure controls and procedures and system of internal controls and audits of our consolidated financial statements, (ii) oversee the relationship with our independent auditors, including appointing or changing our auditors and ensuring their independence, and (iii) provide oversight regarding significant financial matters. The Audit Committee meets privately with our Chief Financial Officer and with our independent registered public accounting firm and evaluates the responses by the Chief Financial Officer both to the facts presented and to the judgments made by our outside independent registered public accounting firm. Yura Barabash serves as the Audit Committee s financial expert. 
 In August 2015, our Board adopted a new Charter for the Audit Committee. A copy of the Audit Committee Charter can be found on our website at www.rcihospitality.com/investor . The Charter establishes the independence of our Audit Committee and sets forth the scope of the Audit Committee s duties. The Audit Committee conducts an ongoing review of our financial reports and other financial information prior to their being filed with the SEC, or otherwise provided to the public. The Audit Committee also reviews our systems, methods and procedures of internal controls in the areas of: financial reporting, audits, treasury operations, corporate finance, managerial, financial and SEC accounting, compliance with law, and ethical conduct. NASDAQ Stock Market Rules require all members of the Audit Committee to be independent. The Audit Committee is objective, and reviews and assesses the work of our independent registered public accounting firm and our internal accounting department. 
 NOMINATING COMMITTEE 
 We have a Nominating Committee whose current members are Elaine Martin, Luke Lirot, Yura Barabash and Arthur Allan Priaulx.

The Charter establishes the independence of our Nominating Committee and sets forth the scope of the Nominating Committee s duties. NASDAQ Stock Market Rules require all members of the Nominating Committee to be independent. Pursuant to its Charter, the Committee has the power and authority to consider Board nominees and proposals submitted by our stockholders and to establish any procedures, including procedures to facilitate stockholder communication with the board of directors, and to make any such disclosures required by applicable law in the course of exercising such authority. A copy of the Nominating Committee s Charter can be found on our website at www.rcihospitality.com/investor .

 Item 11. Executive Compensation. 
 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
 This compensation discussion and analysis describes the material elements of the Company s compensation programs as they relate to our executive officers who are listed in the compensation tables appearing below. This compensation discussion and analysis focuses on the information contained in the following tables and related footnotes. The individuals who served as the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer during fiscal 2023, as well as any other individuals included in the Summary Compensation Table, are referred to as named executive officers ("NEOs"). 
 Overview of Compensation Committee Role and Responsibilities 
 The Compensation Committee of the board of directors oversees our compensation plans and policies, reviews and approves all decisions concerning the named executive officers compensation, which may further be approved by the Board, and administers our stock option and equity plans, including reviewing and approving stock option grants and equity awards under the plans. The Compensation Committee s membership is determined by the Board and is composed entirely of independent directors. 
 Management plays a role in the compensation-setting process. The most significant aspects of management s role are to evaluate employee performance and recommend salary levels and equity compensation awards. Our Chief Executive Officer often makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee and the Board concerning compensation for other executive officers. Our Chief Executive Officer is a member of the Board but does not participate in Board decisions regarding any aspect of his own compensation. The Compensation Committee can retain independent advisors or consultants. 
 Compensation Committee Process 
 The Compensation Committee reviews executive compensation in connection with the evaluation and approval of an employment agreement, an increase in responsibilities or other factors. With respect to equity compensation awarded to other employees, the Compensation Committee or the Board may grant stock options, often after receiving a recommendation from our Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee also evaluates proposals for incentive and performance equity awards, and other compensation. 
 Compensation Philosophy 
 The Compensation Committee emphasizes the important link between the Company s performance, which ultimately affects stockholder value, and the compensation of its executives. Therefore, the primary goal of the Company s executive compensation policy is to try to align the interests of the executive officers with the interests of the stockholders. In order to achieve this goal, the Company attempts to (i) offer compensation opportunities that attract and retain executives whose abilities and skills are critical to the long-term success of the Company and reward them for their efforts in ensuring the success of the Company, (ii) align the Company s compensation programs with the Company s long-term business strategies and objectives, and (iii) provide variable compensation opportunities that are directly linked to the Company s performance and stockholder value, including an equity stake in the Company. Our named executive officers compensation utilizes two primary components base salary and long-term equity compensation to achieve these goals. Additionally, the Compensation Committee may award discretionary bonuses to certain executives based on the individual s contribution to the achievement of the Company s strategic objectives. 
 Setting Executive Compensation 
 We fix executive base compensation at a level we believe enables us to hire and retain individuals in a competitive environment and to reward satisfactory individual performance and a satisfactory level of contribution to our overall business goals. We also take into account the compensation that is paid by companies that we believe to be our competitors and by other companies with which we believe we generally compete for executives. 
 In establishing compensation packages for executive officers, numerous factors are considered, including the particular executive s experience, expertise and performance, our company s overall performance and 
 106 

Table of Contents 

 compensation packages available in the marketplace for similar positions. In arriving at amounts for each component of compensation, our Compensation Committee strives to strike an appropriate balance between base compensation and incentive compensation. The Compensation Committee also endeavors to properly allocate between cash and non-cash compensation and between annual and long-term compensation. 
 The Role of Shareholder Say-on-Pay Votes 
 At our annual meeting of shareholders held on August 28, 2023, approximately 96 of the shareholders who voted (including abstentions) on the say-on-pay proposal approved the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in the proxy statement. Although this advisory shareholder vote on executive compensation is non-binding, the Compensation Committee will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for named executive officers. 
 Base Salary 
 The Company provides executive officers and other employees with base salary to compensate them for services rendered during the fiscal year. Subject to the provisions contained in employment agreements with executive officers concerning base salary amounts, base salaries of the executive officers are established based upon compensation data of comparable companies in our market, the executive s job responsibilities, level of experience, individual performance and contribution to the business. We believe it is important for the Company to provide adequate fixed compensation to highly qualified executives in our competitive industry. In making base salary decisions, the Compensation Committee uses its discretion and judgment based upon personal knowledge of industry practice but does not apply any specific formula to determine the base salaries for the executive officers. 
 Retirement Savings Plan 
 The Company maintains a retirement savings plan for the benefit of our executives and employees. Our Simple IRA Plan is intended to qualify as a defined contribution arrangement under the Internal Revenue Code (the Code ). Participants may elect to defer a percentage of their eligible pretax earnings each year or contribute a fixed amount per pay period up to the maximum contribution permitted by the Code. All participants plan accounts are 100 vested at all times. All assets of our Simple IRA Plan are invested based on participant-directed elections. We make certain matching contributions to the Simple IRA Plan, which are also 100 vested. 
 Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits 
 The Company s executive officers participate in the Company s other benefit plans on the same terms as other employees on a non-discriminatory basis. These plans include medical, dental, life and disability insurance. Relocation benefits also are reimbursed and are individually negotiated when they occur. The Company reimburses each executive officer for all reasonable business and other expenses incurred by them in connection with the performance of their duties and obligations. The Company does not provide named executive officers with any significant perquisites or other personal benefits except for personal travel using Company-owned automobiles and aircrafts. On August 28, 2023, the board of directors, after a recommendation from the Audit Committee, amended the corporate aircraft policy changing the allowed use to a maximum personal use each fiscal year, as follows: (i) 100 hours flown for the CEO and (ii) 48 hours flown each for other executive officers. Refer to footnote on All Other Compensation in the Summary Compensation Table below.

 (1) Amounts represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the stock options granted during the fiscal year, computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. Information about the assumptions used to value these stock option awards can be found in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 (2) All Other Compensation consists of SIMPLE IRA matching contributions, automobile expenses, and personal use of aircraft. We account for personal use of aircraft to be the aggregate incremental cost of personal use of the company aircraft as calculated based on a cost-per-flight-hour charge developed by a nationally recognized and independent service. The charge reflects the direct cost of operating the aircraft, including fuel, additives, lubricants, maintenance labor, airframe parts, engine restoration, and major periodic maintenance. We added actual airport/hangar fees charged to the company on a per-flight basis. The charge does not include fixed costs that do not change based on usage, such as aircraft depreciation, home hangar expenses, and general taxes and insurance. We value automobile expenses based on the annual depreciation rate of automobiles assigned for use by the particular officer, plus cost of insurance, registration, repairs, maintenance, tolls, and fuel. Tax reimbursement benefit is based on automobile fringe benefits.

 CEO Pay Ratio 
 We reviewed a comparison of annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual compensation of our median employee who was selected from all employees who were employed (other than the CEO) during our fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. 
 The SEC s rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee s annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices. As a result, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported below, as other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. 
 The compensation for our CEO in fiscal 2023 of 1,862,465 was approximately 57 times the 32,496 compensation of our fiscal 2023 median employee. 
 Pay vs. Performance 
 We are providing the following information about the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and certain financial performance measures of the Company as required by Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, as it relates to our principal executive officer ("PEO") and certain non-PEO NEOs.

 COMPENSATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES AS THEY RELATE TO RISK MANAGEMENT 
 We attempt to make our compensation programs discretionary, balanced and focused on the long term. We believe goals and objectives of our compensation programs reflect a balanced mix of quantitative and qualitative performance measures to avoid excessive weight on a single performance measure. Our approach to compensation practices and policies applicable to employees and consultants is consistent with that followed for our executives. Based on these factors, we believe that our compensation policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us.

Applicable percentage ownership is based on 9,359,685 shares of common stock outstanding at December 8, 2023. Generally, in computing the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deem outstanding shares of common stock subject to stock options or warrants held by that person that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of December 8, 2023 and shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of other securities held by that person that are currently convertible or convertible within 60 days of December 8, 2023; we do not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Beneficial ownership representing less than 1 is denoted with an asterisk ).

 Review, Approval, or Ratification of Related Transactions 
 On September 23, 2019, the board of directors, acting upon the recommendation of its Audit Committee, adopted a written related party transaction policy, under which related party transactions are subject to review, approval, rejection, modification and/or ratification by the Audit Committee. The policy provides that prior to the entry into any transaction between the Company and one of its officers, directors, 5 shareholders or an immediate family member of any of the foregoing (a related party ), such transaction will be reported to the Company s chief compliance officer. The Company s chief compliance officer will undertake an evaluation of the transaction. If that evaluation indicates that the transaction would require the Audit Committee s approval, the Company s chief compliance officer will report this transaction to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will review the material facts of all related party transactions that require the Audit Committee s approval and either approve or disapprove of the entry into the related party transaction. If advance Audit Committee approval of a related party transaction is not feasible, then the related party transaction will be considered and, if the Audit Committee determines it to be appropriate, ratified at the Audit Committee s next regularly scheduled meeting. In determining whether to approve or ratify a related party transaction, the Audit Committee will take into account factors it deems appropriate. In the event that the Audit Committee determines not to ratify and approve the related party transaction, then the Audit Committee will instruct that the related party transaction be rescinded or unwound. The Audit Committee will not approve or ratify any related party transaction unless it deems that the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related party s interest in the transaction. No director will participate in any discussion or approval of a related party transaction for which he or she is a related party, except that the director shall provide all material information concerning the transaction to the Audit Committee. 
 In reviewing related party transactions under the policy, the Audit Committee will review and consider one or more of the following as it seems appropriate for the circumstances: (1) the related party s interest in the related party transaction; (2) the approximate dollar value of the amount involved in the related party transaction; (3) the approximate dollar value of the amount of the related party s interest in the transaction without regard to the amount of any profit or loss; (4) whether the transaction was undertaken in the ordinary course of business of the Company; (5) whether the transaction with the related party is proposed to be, or was, entered into on terms no less favorable to the Company than terms that could have been reached with an unrelated third party; (6) the purpose of, and the potential benefits to the Company of, the related party transaction; (7) whether the related party transaction would impair the independence of an outside director; (8) required public disclosure, if any; and (9) any other information regarding the related party transaction or the related party in the context of the proposed transaction that would be material to investors in light of the circumstances of the particular transaction. The Audit Committee will review all relevant information available to it about the related party transaction. The Audit Committee may approve or ratify the related party transaction only if the Audit Committee determines in good faith that, under all of the circumstances, the transaction is fair as to the Company. The Audit Committee, in its sole discretion, may impose such condition as it deems appropriate on the Company or the related party in connection with approval of the related party transaction. 
 Our Audit Committee is composed of all independent directors, including Yura Barabash, Elaine Martin and Arthur Allan Priaulx. We additionally have one other independent director, Luke Lirot, who is not on the Audit Committee. The definition of independent used herein is based on the independence standards of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC.

 Erroneously Awarded Compensation means the amount of Incentive Compensation received that exceeds the amount of Incentive Compensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the Restatement, computed without regard to any taxes paid. In the case of Incentive Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the Restatement, the amount shall reflect a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive Compensation was received, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. The Committee may determine the form and amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation in its sole discretion.

 3. RECOVERY FOR RESTATEMENT 
 
 If the Company is required to prepare a Restatement, the Company shall seek to recover and claw back from any Affected Officer reasonably promptly the Erroneously Awarded Compensation that is received by the Affected Officer 
 
 A. After the person begins service as an Affected Officer 
 
 B. Who serves as an Affected Officer at any time during the performance period for that Incentive Compensation 
 
 C. While the Company has a class of securities listed on the Exchange and 
 
 2 

D. During the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company was required to prepare the Restatement (including any transition period within or immediately following those years that results from a change in the Company s fiscal year, provided that a transition period of nine to 12 months will be deemed to be a completed fiscal year). 
 
 If, after the release of earnings for any period for which a Restatement subsequently occurs and prior to the announcement of the Restatement for such period, the Affected Officer sold any securities constituting, or any securities issuable on exercise, settlement or exchange of any equity award constituting, Incentive Compensation, the excess of (a) the actual aggregate sales proceeds from the Affected Officer s sale of those shares, over (b) the aggregate sales proceeds the Affected Officer would have received from the sale of those shares at a price per share determined appropriate by the Committee in its discretion to reflect what the Company s common stock price would have been if the Restatement had occurred prior to such sales, shall be deemed to be Erroneously Awarded Compensation provided, however, that the aggregate sales proceeds determined by the Committee under this clause (b) with respect to shares acquired upon exercise of an option shall not be less than the aggregate exercise price paid for those shares. 
 
 For purposes of this Policy 
 
 1. Erroneously Awarded Compensation is deemed to be received in the Company s fiscal year during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive Compensation is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive Compensation occurs after the end of that period and 
 
 2. The date the Company is required to prepare a Restatement is the earlier of (x) the date the Board, the Committee or any officer of the Company authorized to take such action concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare the Restatement, or (y) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare the Restatement. 
 
 For purposes of clarity, in no event shall the Company be required to award any Affected Officers an additional payment or other compensation if the Restatement would have resulted in the grant, payment or vesting of Incentive Compensation that is greater than the Incentive Compensation actually received by the Affected Officer. The recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not dependent on if or when the Restatement is filed.
