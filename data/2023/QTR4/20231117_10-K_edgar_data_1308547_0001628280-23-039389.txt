PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 OVERVIEW 
 Dolby Laboratories creates audio and imaging technologies that transform entertainment for content playback in movies, TV, music, gaming and user-generated content. Founded in 1965, our strengths stem from expertise in analog and digital signal processing and digital compression technologies that have transformed the ability of artists to convey entertainment experiences to their audiences through recorded media. Such technologies led to the development of our noise-reduction systems for analog tape recordings, and have since evolved into multiple offerings that enable more immersive sound for cinema, DTV transmissions and devices, mobile devices, OTT video and music services, home entertainment devices, and automobiles. 
 
 Today, we derive the majority of our revenue from licensing our audio technologies. We also derive revenue from licensing our consumer imaging technologies, as well as audio and imaging technologies for premium cinema offerings in collaboration with exhibitors. In addition to our licensing business, we provide products and services for a variety of applications in the cinema and broadcast markets, and offer solutions to companies building real-time digital experiences that increase audience engagement. 
 OUR STRATEGY 
 Key elements of our strategy include: 
 Advancing the Science of Sight and Sound. We apply our understanding of the human senses, audio, and imaging engineering to develop technologies aimed at improving how people experience and interact with their entertainment content. 
 Providing Creative Solutions. We promote the use of our solutions as creative tools, and provide our products, services, and technologies to filmmakers, musical artists, sound mixers, and other content creators and providers. Our tools help showcase the quality and impact of their efforts and intent, which in turn may generate market demand. 
 Delivering Superior Experiences. Our technologies and solutions optimize playback so that users may enjoy richer, clearer, and more immersive sound and sight experiences. 
 Expanding the Reach of our Technologies . We look for new and innovative ways to expand the reach of our technologies to new content, media, devices and audiences. For example, we are expanding our addressable market to enhance a broader range of content, by offering solutions to companies building real-time digital experiences that increase audience engagement. Our solution provides the capability to stream high quality audiovisual content in ultra-low latency which reduces the delay between the action and the viewer. Everyone experiencing the action at the same time enables ways to interact with the content.

 We have various licensing models: a two-tier model, an integrated licensing model, a patent licensing model, recoveries, and collaboration arrangements. 
 Two-Tier Licensing Model . Most of our consumer entertainment licensing business consists of a two-tier licensing model whereby our decoding technologies, included in reference software and firmware code, are first provided under license to semiconductor manufacturers whom we refer to as "implementation licensees." Implementation licensees incorporate our technologies in ICs which they sell to OEMs of consumer entertainment products, whom we refer to as "system licensees." System licensees separately obtain licenses from us that allow them to make and sell end-user products using ICs that incorporate our technologies. 
 Implementation licensees incorporate our technologies into their chipsets that, once approved by Dolby, are available for purchase from implementation licensees by OEMs for use in end-user products. Implementation licensees only pay us a nominal initial fee on contract execution as consideration for the ongoing services that we provide to assist in their implementation process. Revenue from these initial fees is recognized ratably over the contractual term as a component of licensing revenue. 
 System licensees provide us with prototypes of products, or self-test results of products that incorporate our technologies. Upon our confirmation that our technologies are optimally and consistently incorporated, the system licensee may buy ICs under a license for the same Dolby technology from our network of implementation licensees, and may further sell approved products to retailers, distributors, and consumers. For the use of our technologies, our system licensees pay an initial licensing fee as well as royalties, which represent the majority of the revenue recognized from these arrangements. The amount of royalties we collect on a particular product depends on several factors including the nature of the implementation, the mix of Dolby technologies used, and the volume of products using our technologies that are shipped by the system licensee. 
 Integrated Licensing Model . We also license our technologies to software operating system vendors and to certain other OEMs that act as combined implementation and system licensees. These licensees incorporate our technologies in their software used on PCs, in mobile applications, or in ICs they manufacture and incorporate into their products. As with the two-tier licensing model, the combined implementation and system licensee pays us an initial licensing fee in addition to royalties as determined by the mix of Dolby technologies used, the nature of the

Table of Contents 

implementations, and the volume of products using our technologies that are shipped, and is subject to the same quality control evaluation process. 
 Patent Licensing Model. We license our patents directly to manufacturers that use our IP in their products. We also license our patents through patent pools which are arrangements between multiple patent owners to jointly offer and license pooled patents to licensees who use our IP in their products. By aggregating and offering pooled patents, these arrangements deliver efficiencies that reduce transactional costs for both IP owners and licensees. Patent pools enable product manufacturers to efficiently and transparently secure patent licenses for collaboratively developed technologies. We offer our patents related to AAC, HE-AAC, Extended HE-AAC, AVC, HEVC, VVC and other standardized technologies through a combination of patent pools and licensing directly to OEMs. Finally, Via LA (as defined below) generates fees for administering patent pools on behalf of third party patent owners. See Note 15 " Business Combinations " to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the recent business combination involving Via LA. 
 Recoveries. Licensing revenue recognized in any given period may include revenue from licensees and/or settlements with third parties where the use of our technology occurred in previous periods. Within the Results of Operations section of Part II, Item 7 " Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, " revenue attributable to previous periods' usage including settlements are collectively referred to as "recoveries." Such recoveries have become a recurring element of our business and are particularly subject to fluctuation and unpredictability. 
 Collaboration Arrangements 
 Dolby Cinema: We partner with exhibitors to deliver a premium cinema offering with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos at new and pre-existing venues. We receive revenue at Dolby Cinema sites through a share of box office receipts, which is recognized as licensing revenue. 
 Products 
 We design and manufacture audio and imaging hardware and software products for the cinema, television, broadcast, and entertainment industries. Distributed in approximately 90 countries, these products are used in content creation, distribution, and playback to enhance image and sound quality, and improve transmission and playback. Additionally, some of our Dolby Cinema arrangements are classified as sales-type leases, and as a result are included in products sales. 
 Key products from which we generate products revenue are summarized in the table below: Product Description Cinema Cinema Imaging Products Digital Cinema Servers used to load, store, decrypt, decode, watermark, and playback digital film files for presentation on digital cinema projectors and software used to encrypt, encode, and package digital media files for distribution Cinema Audio Products Cinema Processors, amplifiers, and loudspeakers used to decode, render, and optimally play back digital cinema soundtracks, including those using Dolby Atmos Other Other Products 3-D glasses and kits, broadcast hardware and software used to encode, transmit, and decode multiple channels of high-quality audio for DTV and HDTV distribution, monitors, and accessibility solutions for hearing and visually impaired consumers 
 Services 
 We offer solutions to companies building real-time digital experiences that increase audience engagement. Over time, we expect to significantly expand the amount and types of content that can be enhanced through our technologies and capabilities. 
 In addition, we offer various services to support theatrical and television production for cinema exhibition, broadcast, and home entertainment, including equipment training and maintenance, mixing room alignment, equalization, as well as audio, color, and light image calibration. We also provide PCS for products sold and equipment installed at Dolby Cinema theaters operated by exhibitor partners and support the implementation of our technologies into products manufactured by our licensees. 
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 We have a substantial base of IP assets, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets developed based on our technical expertise. 
 6 

Table of Contents 

As of September 29, 2023, we had approximately 19,300 issued patents and approximately 1,900 pending patent applications in more than 100 jurisdictions throughout the world. Our currently issued patents expire at various times through September 2045. 
 Some of our patents relating to DD technologies have expired, and others will expire over the next several years. While in the past we derived a significant portion of our licensing revenue from our DD technologies, this is no longer the case as revenue attributed to DD technologies has declined and is expected to continue to decline. The primary products where DD is widely used include automotive, TVs, and soundbars. We have transitioned a number of our DD licensees to DD+ technologies, an extension of our DD technologies, whose patents generally expire later than the DD patents. 
 We pursue a general practice of filing patent applications for our technologies in the United States ("U.S.") and foreign countries where our customers manufacture, distribute, or sell licensed products. We actively pursue new applications to expand our patent portfolio to address new technological innovations, and we also make strategic acquisitions of technology and patents from time to time. We have multiple patents covering aspects and improvements for many of our technologies. 
 We have approximately 1,600 trademark registrations throughout the world for a variety of wordmarks, logos, and slogans. Our trademarks cover our various products, technologies, improvements, and features, as well as the services that we provide. These trademarks are an integral part of our technology licensing program, and licensees typically elect to place our trademarks on their products to inform consumers that their products incorporate our technology and meet our quality specifications. 
 We protect our IP rights both domestically and internationally. From time to time, OEMs have failed to report or have underreported shipments of their products that incorporate our technologies. We have also had problems with implementation licensees selling ICs with our technologies to third parties that are not system licensees. We anticipate that such problems will continue to occur. Accordingly, we have taken steps in the past to enforce our IP rights and expect to continue doing so in the future. 
 Moreover, in certain countries, we have relatively few or no issued patents. For example, in some African and Central and South American countries, we have only limited patent protection for our technologies. Consequently, we may realize less revenue from those regions in the future. Maintaining or growing our licensing revenue in developing countries will depend in part on whether we obtain patent rights in those countries, which is uncertain. Further, because of the limitations of the legal systems in many countries, the effectiveness of patents obtained or that may in the future be obtained is uncertain. 
 INDUSTRY STANDARDS 
 Several Dolby technologies have been adopted as, or are included in, the explicit or de facto industry standard for broadcast, discrete media, and online delivery in various markets worldwide. 
 Explicit industry standards are adopted through a standardization process whereby government entities, industry standards-setting bodies, trade associations, and others evaluate and then prescribe the use of a technology. For example, as global broadcast standards for digital, HD, and UHD television have developed, Dolby audio technologies have been adopted or mandated in various regions of the world, highlights of which are as follows: 
 DD+ and HE-AAC are mandated for use in terrestrial broadcast across many countries including France, Italy, the United Kingdom ("U.K."), Sweden, Germany, Poland, Turkey, and Russia. In addition, DD+ and HE-AAC are included in the digital terrestrial television specifications of emerging digital TV markets in Africa, Brazil, South-East Asia, and India while operators in China have selected DD and DD+ as optional technologies for transmissions using the country s digital terrestrial television specification. 
 DD is mandated for HD broadcast in multiple regions including North America and South Korea, and for DVD players on a global basis. 
 AC-4 is Dolby s audio coding technology that has been adopted for implementation for next generation broadcast services in certain regions by worldwide standards organizations including the DVB and ATSC. In Europe, AC-4 has been mandated in next generation broadcast specifications for Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Poland and Sweden, and is also included in the specification for the new UHD terrestrial TV platform issued by regulator ARCOM in France. In North America, AC-4 is mandated for TVs for the NextGen TV over-the-air broadcast platform, based on ATSC3.0. The adoption of AC-4 
 7 

Table of Contents 

continues to grow, and AC-4 is already widely supported in UHDTVs available worldwide from major manufacturers. 
 In mobile devices, HE-AAC v2 (3GPP eAAC +) is specified for various applications in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project suite of standards. 
 Extended HE-AAC is included in Digital Radio Mondiale radio broadcasting standards. 
 In addition, Dolby technologies have become, or are included in, de facto industry standards in many consumer entertainment products. De facto industry standards are adopted by industry participants when technologies are introduced to the marketplace and become widely used, and include the following examples: 
 Prior to the adoption of HD terrestrial broadcast standards mandating Dolby technologies, many European HD broadcasters began broadcasting in DD or DD+, leading OEMs to include these technologies in their televisions and STBs for the European market. 
 HE-AAC is a de facto audio standard in entertainment services. It is included in popular operating systems and widely used by major broadcasting, streaming, and radio services. 
 DD+ is the de facto technology used by a wide range of pay-TV operators and streaming services worldwide and is included in popular operating systems such as iOS and Windows. It is also widely used by major OTT services such as Apple TV+, Disney+, Netflix, and Amazon, and is included in the specifications of these services. 
 Extended HE-AAC is a de facto industry standard in streaming applications. It is included in popular operating systems and used in major OTT services. 
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
 We conduct R D activities at numerous locations in the U.S. and internationally. Dolby s history of producing innovative technology has created many forms of IP. This IP generates licensing revenue that enables us to fund and pursue further innovation. 
 The majority of our R D resources are focused on developing leading audio and imaging technologies for consumer entertainment. Each of these technologies can support many offerings, and we anticipate bringing new innovations to market in the future. 
 PRODUCT MANUFACTURING 
 Our product quality is enabled through the use of well-established, and in some cases, highly automated, assembly processes along with rigorous testing of our products. We rely primarily upon contract manufacturers for the majority of our production capacity. We purchase components and fabricated parts from multiple suppliers; however, we rely on sole source suppliers for certain components used to manufacture our products. We source components and fabricated parts both domestically and internationally. 
 SALES AND MARKETING 
 Our marketing efforts focus on demonstrating how our solutions improve entertainment experiences. We sell our solutions primarily using an internal sales organization to various customers in the markets where we operate. We also license our technologies and IP indirectly through patent pools, where owners of IP covering technology standards aggregate their patents and offer the pooled patents to implementers through patent pool licensing administrators who are responsible for the sales and marketing of the pooled patents . We promote our solutions and our brand through industry events such as trade-shows, film festivals, movie premieres, product launches, as well as through our website, public relations, direct marketing, co-marketing programs, and social media. In addition, we hold the naming rights to the Dolby Theatre, home to the Academy Awards in Hollywood, California, where we showcase our technology and host high-profile events. We also hold the naming rights to Dolby Live at the Park MGM in Las Vegas, Nevada. Dolby Live is a fully integrated performance venue offering live concerts in Dolby Atmos. We maintain more than 20 sales offices in key regions around the globe. 
 CUSTOMERS 
 We license our technologies to a broad set of customers that operate in a wide range of industries, and we sell our professional products either directly to the end user or, more commonly, through dealers and distributors. Users of 
 8 

Table of Contents 

our professional products and services include film studios, content creators, post-production facilities, cinema operators, broadcasters, and video game designers. 
 COMPETITION 
 The entertainment industry are highly competitive, and we face aggressive competition in all areas of our business. Some of our current and future competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources than we do, or may have more experience or advantages in the markets in which they compete. In addition, some of our current or potential competitors may be able to offer integrated systems in certain markets for entertainment technologies, including audio and imaging, which could make competing technologies that we develop or acquire obsolete. By offering an integrated system solution, these potential competitors may also be able to offer competing technologies at lower prices than we can, which could adversely affect our operating results. 
 Many products that include our audio and imaging technologies also include technologies developed by our competitors. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include some or all of the following: 
 Degree of access and inclusion in industry standards; 
 Technological performance, flexibility, and range of application; 
 Brand recognition and reputation; 
 Timeliness and relevance of new product introductions; 
 Quality and reliability of products and services; 
 Relationships with producers, directors, and distributors in the film and television industry, with television broadcast industry leaders, with OTT industry leaders, and with the management of semiconductor and CE OEMs; 
 Availability of compatible high quality audio and video content; and 
 Price. 
 Certain foreign governments, particularly in China, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for IP, which can impact the licensing fees that we are able to collect. The regulatory enforcement activities in such jurisdictions can be unpredictable, in some cases because these jurisdictions have only recently implemented competition laws. 
 Our technologies, products, and services span the audio and imaging sectors of several distinct and diverse industries, including the broadcast, mobile, consumer entertainment, PC, gaming, automotive, cinema, and other industries. The lack of a clear definition of the markets in which our products, services, and technologies are sold or licensed, the nature of our technologies, their potential use for various commercial applications, and the diverse nature of and lack of detailed reporting by our competitors, make it impracticable to quantify our position. 
 HUMAN CAPITAL 
 At Dolby, we strive to act as a good partner to our customers, employees, shareholders, and communities. We are committed to fostering a workplace environment in which every employee can contribute their fullest potential and make a positive impact through their roles. 
 Details of this work are available in our Sustainability Report, and we encourage you to read it on our website and learn more. Nothing in our Sustainability Report shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We continue to implement business strategies that support the health and safety of our employees and enable business continuity. We have implemented a flex work program that enables employee connection and effective work delivery globally. In a company-wide survey in May 2023, Motivation Commitment scores indicate that we remain highly connected to our work and each other. 
 Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging ("DIB") 
 To spark positive change, bolster employee resiliency, and strengthen our community, DIB is embedded across company programs. Our approach comprises investing in the next generation of talent, cultivating a culture of inclusion, and belonging and advancing and retaining our employees. 
 To invest in the talent of the future, we provide financial contributions, employee engagement, and support of science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics education and partnerships at K-12 schools and universities. 
 We have programs and practices in place to support creating an environment where individual experiences and perspectives are welcome and where everyone can belong and thrive. This includes equipping our leaders, colleagues, and peers with tools to have open and authentic conversations. We look at diversity, inclusion and belonging comprehensively through hiring, retention, progression, and employee experiences. 
 We empower everyone at Dolby to be co-creators of change by offering employees opportunities to learn and grow through educational sessions, hands-on workshops, and employee-led Employee Network ("EN") events. Our EN community encompasses 14 networks, convening around many different dimensions of diversity including gender, race/ethnicity and more, to build community and drive awareness of issues impacting employees identifying with these dimensions of diversity and their allies. 
 We hold ourselves accountable for our progress and publish our global gender diversity and U.S. race and ethnic diversity workforce data annually. We encourage you to review our Sustainability Report for more detailed information. 
 Compensation and Benefits 
 We offer competitive compensation (including salary, incentive bonus, and equity) and benefits packages in each of our locations around the globe. In addition to comprehensive health benefits and the ESPP, depending on the location, employees may also enjoy free or subsidized fitness programs, commuter benefits, wellness credits, tuition reimbursement opportunities, and personal development courses, among other benefits. 
 Social Impact 
 Through our social impact programs, employees from our offices around the world organize to volunteer as individuals, as part of a work team or through our diversity, inclusion, and belonging employee networks. From mentoring youth, to supporting adults re-entering the workforce, to aiding people experiencing hardships, our employees are making our communities stronger. We partner with organizations in our local communities around the world, including the Arts, Media and Entertainment Institute, Bay Area Video Coalition, Girls Make Beats, Girls Who Code, IGNITE Worldwide, Inneract Project, University of Sydney s Women in Engineering Program, and Fundacja Rodziny Maciejko in Poland to organize employee volunteer opportunities. Our efforts are intended to share Dolby s experiences, ideas and approaches from our unique position at the intersection of science, technology and art.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem less significant may also affect our business operations or financial results. If any of the following risks actually occur, our stock price, business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 
 REVENUE GENERATION 
 Markets We Target 
 Our licensing business depends on the incorporation of our technologies into products and the sales of such products, which are, in large part, not within our control. Our licensing businesses depend on OEMs and other licensees to incorporate our technologies into their products. Our license agreements generally do not have minimum purchase commitments, are typically non-exclusive, and frequently do not mandate incorporation or use of our technologies. Our revenue will decline if our licensees choose not to incorporate our technologies into their products or if they sell fewer products incorporating our technologies. 
 Changing trends in content distribution and consumption may negatively impact our business . Changing trends in the way that content is distributed and consumed may impact our existing business and future opportunities for growth. One such trend is the shift by consumers in certain markets away from subscription-based cable and satellite television providers toward streaming services, commonly referred to as "cord-cutting." While cable and satellite television often require a STB, today consumers can also access streaming media through smart TVs or DMA devices. As consumers trend toward canceling subscriptions to these traditional cable and satellite providers and turn to streaming media, we expect demand for STBs in certain regions to continue to decline. If we are unable to derive additional revenue from the smart TV and DMA markets to make up for decreases in our STB-related revenue, our financial results may be negatively impacted. Other changes to the way content is distributed and consumed may impact our licensing and other businesses in a similar fashion, and we may not be able to anticipate and respond effectively to such future changes. 
 The mobile device market is concentrated and susceptible to competition and rapid change, which may negatively affect our penetration and pricing in that market . Successful penetration of the mobile device market is important to our future growth. The mobile device market, particularly smartphones and tablets, is characterized by rapidly changing market conditions, frequent product introductions and intense competition based on features and price. Our technologies usually are not mandated as an industry standard for mobile devices. We must continually convince mobile device OEMs and end users of mobile devices of the value of our technologies. With shorter product lifecycles, it is easier for mobile device OEMs to add or remove our technologies from mobile devices than it is for TV OEMs and other hardware OEMs. In addition, because the mobile industry is concentrated, we rely on a small number of partnerships with key participants in the mobile market. If we are unable to maintain these key relationships, we may experience a decline in mobile devices incorporating our technologies. 
 In order to increase the value of our technologies in the mobile market and increase OEM and software vendor demand for our decoding technologies, we have worked with online and mobile media content service providers to encode their content with our technologies. However, the online and mobile media content services markets are also characterized by intense competition, evolving industry standards and business and distribution models, disruptive software and hardware technology developments, frequent product and service introductions and short life cycles, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers, all of which may result in downward pressure on pricing or the removal of our technologies by these providers and may result in decreased revenue from our mobile market. Further, macroeconomic conditions due to inflation, geopolitical instability, global health risks, and other factors may adversely impact consumer demand for mobile devices. Such conditions may continue to adversely impact the ability of our partners to manufacture such devices, supply chain and distribution, the timing of the adoption of our technologies into products by partners and licensees, and the timing of launches for new products. 
 Our revenue from the PC market is reliant on key partnerships and is vulnerable to macroeconomic risks . Our revenue from the PC market depends on several factors, including underlying PC unit shipments, the extent to which our technologies are included on computers, including through operating systems and various subsystems, and the terms of any royalties or other payments we receive. Further, we rely on a small number of partnerships with key participants in the PC market. If we are unable to maintain these key relationships, we may experience a decline in PCs incorporating our technologies. Further, demand for PCs has recently been declining and it remains uncertain 
 12

when, if, and to what extent PC demand will return to historic levels. Such conditions may also continue to adversely impact PC manufacturing, supply chain and distribution, the timing of the adoption of our technologies into products by partners and licensees, and the timing of launches for new products. 
 The success of Dolby Cinema and cinema product sales are subject to a number of factors beyond our control, such as the production of films in Dolby formats and broader cinema industry conditions. Revenue from Dolby Cinema and cinema product sales is subject to our ability to develop and implement new technologies, the pace of construction or upgrade of screens, the financial stability of exhibitors, the advent of new or competing technologies, and the willingness of movie studios to produce films in our Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision formats. Although we have invested a substantial amount of time and resources developing Dolby Cinema, and expect to continue to invest and build partnerships in connection with the launch of Dolby Cinema locations, we may not continue to recognize a meaningful amount of revenue from these efforts in the near future. Additionally, we collaborate with multiple exhibitors in foreign markets, including Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, and we may face a number of risks in expanding Dolby Cinema in these and other new international markets. The revenue we receive from Dolby Cinema exhibitors is based on a portion of box-office receipts from the installed theaters, and the timing of such theater installations is dependent upon a number of factors beyond our control. In addition, the success of our Dolby Cinema offering will be tied to the pipeline and success of motion pictures available at Dolby Cinema locations generally. The success of Dolby Cinema and cinema products depends in large part on our ability to differentiate our offering, deploy new sites and installations in accordance with plans, provide a compelling experience, and attract and retain a viewing audience. A decrease in our ability to develop and introduce new cinema products and services successfully could affect licensing of our consumer technologies, because the strength of our brand and our ability to use professional product developments to introduce new consumer technologies would be negatively impacted. To the extent that we do not make progress in these areas or are faced with pricing pressures or competing technologies, our revenue may be adversely impacted. 
 Our revenue and associated demand for Dolby Cinema and cinema products are affected by cinema industry and macroeconomic conditions, which are subject to risks including consumer trends and box office performance generally, delays in cinematic releases, the seasonality of film releases and associated moviegoing attendance, and other events or conditions in the cinema industry. Cinema attendance and revenues have been reduced in the wake of COVID-19 and it remains uncertain when, if, and to what extent cinema attendance will return to pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, the recently concluded strikes by the Writers Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists SAG-AFTRA effectively halted the production, release and promotion of certain films for an extended period. The resulting impacts of those stoppages may lead to decreased box office receipts in the near term, which would directly impact the revenue generated by Dolby Cinema theaters and could potentially impact exhibitors willingness and ability to invest in Dolby cinema products. Also, a portion of our opportunity lies in the China market, which is subject to unique economic and geopolitical risks. Furthermore, future growth of our cinema products offerings also depends upon new theater construction and entering into an equipment replacement cycle whereby previously purchased cinema products are upgraded or replaced. To the extent that such cinema industry and macroeconomic challenges constrain the growth of our Dolby Cinema and cinema products offerings, our revenue may be adversely impacted. 
 Customers and Distributors 
 The loss of a key licensee or customer may materially impact our revenue . A small number of our licensees or other customers may represent a significant percentage of our licensing, products, or services revenue. Although we generally have agreements with these licensees and other customers, these agreements typically do not require any minimum purchases or minimum royalty fees and do not prohibit licensees from using competing technologies or customers from purchasing products and services from competitors. Customer demand for our technologies and products can shift quickly as many of our markets are rapidly evolving. In consumer electronic device markets, our technologies are not mandated and are subject to significant competition, so there is a risk that a large consumer electronic device licensee may reduce or eliminate its use of our technologies. 
 Our licensing business depends, in part, on semiconductor manufacturers and the availability of semiconductor components . Our licensing revenue from OEM system licensees depends in large part upon the availability of ICs that implement our technologies. IC manufacturers incorporate our technologies into these ICs, which are then incorporated in consumer entertainment products. We do not manufacture these ICs, but rather depend on IC manufacturers to develop, produce, and then sell them to system licensees in accordance with their agreements. We do not control the IC manufacturers decisions on whether or not to incorporate our technologies into their ICs, and we do not control their product development or commercialization efforts. Further, demand levels may result in shortages 
 13 

Table of Contents 

of semiconductor components and other key materials that may adversely impact the ability of our implementation and system licensees and other customers to meet product demand in a timely fashion. 
 Consumer spending weakness may impact our licensees and licensing revenues generally . Weakness in general economic conditions due to inflation, heightened interest rates, lower consumer confidence, a potential recession, pandemic or other worsening economic conditions, may suppress consumer demand in our markets and consumers going to the movies. Many of the products in which our technologies are incorporated are discretionary goods, such as PCs, TVs, STBs, Blu-ray Disc players, video game consoles, AVRs, mobile devices, in-car entertainment systems, and home-theater systems, which makes revenue generated by such technologies vulnerable to weakness in consumer spending. Weakness in consumer spending may also lead to licensees and other customers becoming delinquent on their obligations to us or being unable to pay, resulting in a higher level of write-offs. Weakness in consumer spending may also increase underreporting and non-reporting of royalty-bearing revenue by our licensees as well as increase the unauthorized use of our technologies. 
 Our reliance on distributors may impact sales of certain products and present compliance risks. We rely significantly on a global network of independent, regional distributors to market and distribute our cinema and broadcast products. Our distributor arrangements are non-exclusive and our distributors are not obligated to buy our products and can represent competing products. Thus, they may be unwilling or unable to dedicate the resources necessary to promote our portfolio of products. Our distributors could retain product channel inventory levels that exceed future anticipated sales, which could affect our future sales to those distributors. In addition, failure of our distributors to adhere to our policies designed to promote compliance with global anticorruption laws, export controls, and local laws, could subject us to criminal or civil penalties and stockholder litigation. 
 Marketing and Branding 
 If we fail to promote and maintain the Dolby brand, our business will suffer. Maintaining and strengthening the Dolby brand is critical to maintaining and expanding our licensing, products, and services business, as well as our ability to offer technologies for new markets, including Dolby Cinema, Dolby Vision and other imaging offerings for the consumer market, Dolby.io, and others. Our continued success depends on our reputation for providing high quality technologies, products, and services across a wide range of entertainment markets, including the consumer electronics, PC, broadcast, and gaming markets. If we fail to promote and maintain the Dolby brand successfully in licensing, products or services, our business will suffer. Furthermore, we believe that the strength of our brand may affect the likelihood that our technologies are adopted as industry standards in various markets and for various applications. Our ability to maintain and strengthen our brand will depend heavily on our ability to develop innovative technologies for the entertainment industry, to enter into new markets successfully, and to provide high quality products and services in these new markets. In addition, our practices and public disclosures related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters could impact our brand and reputation. If our ESG practices do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations and societal and regulatory standards, or if we are unable to make progress on or achieve our goals and objectives in this area, then our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment or business partner could be negatively impacted, which could adversely affect our operating results. 
 Industry Standards 
 Certain parts of our business are dependent on the inclusion of our technologies in industry standards, the adoption and development of which are not fully within our control. Standards-setting organizations establish technology standards for use in a wide range of products and solutions. The entertainment industry in particular has historically depended upon industry standards to ensure compatibility and interoperability across delivery platforms and a wide variety of consumer entertainment products. We make significant efforts to design our products and technologies to address capability, quality, and cost considerations so that they either meet or, more importantly, are adopted as industry standards across the broad range of entertainment industry markets in which we participate, as well as the markets in which we plan to compete in the future. We are also active in standards development where many contributing members work together to come up with next-generation technology standards in media, entertainment, and communications technologies. Nonetheless, it can be difficult to have our technologies and products adopted as industry standards. To do so, we must convince a broad spectrum of standards-setting organizations throughout the world, as well as our major customers and licensees who are members of such organizations, to adopt them as such. Multiple companies, including ones that typically compete against one another, are involved in the development of new technology standards for use in consumer products. Furthermore, some standards-setting organizations choose to adopt a set of optional standards or a combination of mandatory and optional standards; in such cases, our technologies may be adopted only as an optional standard and not a mandatory standard. Standards may also change in ways that are unfavorable to Dolby. 
 14

The market for broadcast technologies in particular has traditionally been heavily based on industry standards, in some cases mandated by governments choosing from among alternative standards, and we expect this to continue to be the case in the future. The continued advancement of OTT media delivery and consumption is altering the landscape for broadcast standards and impacting the importance of the inclusion of our technology in certain broadcast standards, and we cannot predict if and to what extent this may impact our revenue. 
 Participants may choose alternative technologies within standards . Even when a standards-setting organization incorporates our technologies in an industry standard for a particular market or geographic region, our technologies may not be the sole technologies adopted for that market. Furthermore, different standards may be adopted within a single market or region, and across different markets and regions. Our operating results depend upon participants in that market choosing to adopt our technologies instead of competitive technologies that also may be acceptable under such standard. For example, the continued growth of our revenue from the broadcast market will depend upon both the continued global adoption of DTV generally, including in emerging markets, and the choice to use our technologies where it is one of several accepted industry standards. 
 Being part of a standard may limit our licensing practices. When a standards-setting organization mandates our technologies, we generally must agree to license such technologies on a fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory basis, which could limit our control over the use of these technologies. In these situations, we must often limit the royalty rates we charge for these technologies, and we may be unable to limit to whom we license such technologies or to restrict many terms of the license. We have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to claims that our licensing of industry standard technologies may not conform to the requirements of the standards-setting organization. Allegations such as these could be asserted in private actions seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief, or in regulatory actions. Claimants in such cases could seek to restrict or change our licensing practices or our ability to license our technologies. Additionally, where our technologies are incorporated into a standard, our licensing practices may become subject to additional regulatory requirements. For example, the European Union (EU) legislature is considering regulation that would impose a number of requirements on standard essential patent (SEP) licensing practices in the EU. Such regulation could, if it comes into effect, impose additional costs and disclosure requirements on our SEP licensing business and potentially reduce associated revenue. 
 Royalty Reporting 
 Reporting practices and uncertainty may result in fluctuations in our royalty revenue from period to period. Our operating results fluctuate based on the risks set forth in this section, as well as, among other factors, on: 
 Royalty reports including positive or negative corrective adjustments; 
 Retroactive royalties that cover extended periods of time; and 
 Timing of revenue recognition under licensing agreements and other contractual arrangements, including recognition of unusually large amounts of revenue in any given quarter. 
 Our results of operations could be impacted to the extent that actual revenue differs significantly from estimated revenue, or that we are required to accelerate recognition of revenue under certain arrangements, potentially causing the amount of revenue we recognize to vary materially from quarter to quarter. While our reporting practices do not change the cash flows or total revenue we receive from our contracts with customers, it could result in changes to the timing of our reported revenue and income, which in turn could cause volatility in the price of our Class A common stock. 
 Royalty reporting by our licensees may be inaccurate or understated . We generate licensing revenue primarily from OEMs who license our technologies and incorporate those technologies into their products. Our license agreements generally obligate our licensees to pay us a specified royalty for every product they ship that incorporates our technologies, and we rely on our licensees to report their shipments accurately. However, it is inherently difficult to independently determine whether our licensees are reporting shipments accurately, particularly with respect to software incorporating our technologies because unauthorized copies of such software can be made relatively easily. A third party may disagree with our interpretation of the terms of a license agreement or, as a result of an audit, a third party could challenge the accuracy of our calculation. We are regularly involved in discussions with third party technology licensees regarding license terms. Most of our license agreements permit us to audit our licensees records, and we routinely exercise these rights, typically by using an independent third party auditor. Such audits are generally expensive, time-consuming, and potentially detrimental to our ongoing business relationships with our licensees. In the past, licensees have understated or failed to report the number of products incorporating our technologies that they shipped, and we have not been able to collect and recognize revenue to which we were 
 15 

Table of Contents 

entitled. We expect that we will continue to experience understatement and non-reporting of royalties by our licensees. We have been able to obtain certain recovery payments from licensees (either in the form of back payments or settlements), and such recoveries have become a recurring element of our business; however, we are unable to predict with certainty the revenue that we may recover in the future or our ability to continue to obtain such recoveries at all. 
 Estimation of sales-based royalties may differ from actual results, which may cause volatility in royalty revenue from period to period . We recognize a material portion of our licensing revenue based on our estimate of shipments to which we expect our licensees to submit royalty statements. Upon receipt of actual reporting of sales-based royalties that we estimated previously, we record a favorable or unfavorable adjustment based on the difference, if any, between estimated and actual sales. This may cause volatility in our quarterly figures because of the estimation process and the corresponding true-up adjustments, which we disclose. 
 The amount of royalties we owe others may be disputed . In some cases, the products we sell and the technologies we license include IP that we have licensed from third parties. Our agreements with these third parties generally require us to pay them royalties for that use, and to give the third parties the right to audit our calculation of those royalties. A third party may disagree with our interpretation of the terms of a license agreement or, as a result of an audit, a third party could challenge the accuracy of our calculation. A successful challenge by a third party could result in the termination of a license agreement or an increase in the amount of royalties we have to pay to the third party. 
 TECHNOLOGY TRENDS AND DEVELOPMENTS 
 Developing new and enhanced technologies is inherently difficult and our revenue growth may be impacted if we are unsuccessful in our efforts . Our revenue growth will depend upon our success in new and existing markets for our technologies, such as digital broadcast, mobile devices, online and mobile media distribution, cinema, consumer imaging and communications. The markets for our technologies and products are influenced by: 
 Rapid technological change; 
 New and improved technology and frequent product introductions; 
 Changing consumer and licensee demands; 
 Evolving industry standards; and 
 Technology and product obsolescence. 
 Our future success depends on our ability to enhance our technologies and products and to develop new technologies and products that address market needs in a timely manner, including the development of technologies and products that incorporate rapidly developing machine learning and other artificial intelligence technologies AI/ML ). Technology development is a complex, uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation, highly-skilled engineering and development personnel, and the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We may not be able to identify, develop, acquire, market, or support new or enhanced technologies or products on a timely basis, if at all. If we are unable to develop technologies and related intellectual property that are accepted into technology standards, or are unable to do so at the same rate as other technology developers, our royalty share within patent pools that we participate in may decline. 
 Our efforts to expand into new markets may not be successful . Our future growth will depend, in part, upon our continued expansion into areas beyond our audio licensing business. As we enter into new markets, we will face new sources of competition, new business models, and new customer relationships. In order to be successful in these markets, we will need to cultivate new industry relationships and strengthen existing relationships to bring our products, services, and technologies to market. Our limited experience in new markets could limit our ability to successfully execute on our growth strategy. 
 The success of our existing products and newer initiatives is dependent on the use of Dolby formats in, and commercial success of, products and content . The success of many of our newer initiatives, such as Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Cinema, is dependent upon the availability and success of (i) products that incorporate Dolby formats and (ii) content produced in Dolby formats. However, there is no guarantee that device makers will continue to incorporate Dolby formats into their products, that content creators will continue to release content in Dolby formats, or that either those products or that content will be commercially successful. 
 For instance, to broaden adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, we will need to continue to expand the 
 16 

Table of Contents 

array of products and consumer devices that incorporate Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision, expand the pipeline of Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision content available from content creators, and encourage consumer adoption in the face of competing products and technologies. Similarly, the success of Dolby Cinema is dependent on our ability to partner with movie theater exhibitors to launch new Dolby Cinema sites and to deploy new sites in accordance with plans, and on the continued release and box-office success of new films in the Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos formats released through Dolby Cinemas. 
 Further, the commercial success of products incorporating Dolby formats, content released in Dolby formats, and Dolby Cinemas generally, depends upon a number of factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to, consumer preferences, critical reception, timing of release, marketing efforts of third-parties, and general market conditions. Moreover, release and distribution of such products and content can be subject to delays in production or changes in release schedule, which can negatively impact the quantity, timing and quality of such products and content released in Dolby formats and available at Dolby Cinema theaters. 
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 Our business is dependent on protecting our intellectual property rights. Our business is dependent upon protecting our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other IP rights, the loss or expiration of which may significantly impact our results of operations and financial condition. Effective IP rights protection, however, may not be available under the laws of every country in which our products and services and those of our licensees are distributed. The efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. We also seek to maintain select IP as trade secrets, and third parties or our employees could intentionally or accidentally compromise the IP that we maintain as trade secrets. In addition, protecting our IP rights is costly and time consuming. We have taken steps in the past to enforce our IP rights and expect to do so in the future. However, it may not be practicable or cost effective for us to enforce our IP rights fully, particularly in some countries or where the initiation of a claim might harm our business relationships. 
 We generally seek patent protection for our innovations. However, our patent program faces a number of challenges, including: 
 Possibility that innovations may not be protectable; 
 Failure to protect innovations that later turn out to be important; 
 Insufficient patent protection to prevent third parties from designing around our patent claims; 
 Our pending patent applications may not be approved; and 
 Possibility that an issued patent may later be found to be invalid or unenforceable. 
 Our revenue could decline if we are unable to maintain patent coverage for our technologies . Many of the technologies that we license to our system licensees are covered by patents, and the licensing revenue that we receive from those licenses depends in large part upon the life of such patents. In general, our agreements with our licensees require them to pay us a full royalty with respect to a particular technology only until there are no patents or, in some cases, no patent applications covering that technology in countries where applicable products are made and sold. As of September 29, 2023, we had approximately 19,300 issued patents in addition to approximately 1,900 pending patent applications in more than 100 jurisdictions throughout the world. Our currently issued patents expire at various times through September 2045. If we are unable to refresh our technology with new patented inventions or expand our patent portfolio, our revenue could decline. In addition to patents covering technology we license directly, if patents we license through patent pool arrangements expire or are otherwise deemed not to be valuable by the licensees of such patent pools, they may not renew their licenses, which could impact our revenue. 
 
 We seek to mitigate this risk in a variety of ways. We regularly look for opportunities to expand our patent portfolio through organic development and acquisitions. We develop technologies to replace licensing revenue from technologies covered by expiring patents with licensing revenue supported by patents with a longer remaining life. And we develop and license our intellectual property in a manner designed to promote the continued use and licensing of our technology. The continued success of these risk mitigation strategies is not guaranteed, including the risk that such technologies will not achieve widespread adoption or be licensed at a rate sufficient to replace licensing revenue from technologies covered by expiring patents. 
 In the case of our patent coverage related to DD, some of our relevant patents have expired, but others continue to apply. DD is our solution that includes technology necessary to implement AC-3 as it has been updated over time. We have continued to innovate and develop IP to support the standard and its implementation. Our customers use our 
 17 

Table of Contents 

DD implementation for quality, reliability, and performance, even in locations where we have not had applicable patent coverage. While in the past, we derived a significant portion of our licensing revenue from our DD technologies, this is no longer the case as revenue attributed to DD technologies has declined and is expected to continue to decline. 
 Many of our partners have adopted newer generations of our offerings such as DD+, and the range of products incorporating DD solutions is now limited to DVD players (but not Blu-ray players) and some TVs, STBs and soundbars. To continue to be successful in our audio licensing business, we must keep transitioning our DD licensees to our newer technologies, including our DD+ and Dolby AC-4 technologies. 
 Unauthorized use of our intellectual property has occurred and will likely continue to occur . We have often experienced, and expect to continue to experience, problems with non-licensee OEMs and software vendors, particularly in China and certain emerging economies, incorporating our technologies and trademarks into their products without our authorization and without paying us any licensing fees. Manufacturers of ICs containing our technologies occasionally sell these ICs to third parties who are not our system licensees. These sales, and the failure of such manufacturers to report the sales, facilitate the unauthorized use of our IP. As emerging economies transition from analog to digital content, such as the transition from analog to digital broadcast, we expect to experience an increase in problems with this form of piracy. 
 Our business may be negatively impacted by intellectual property litigation . Companies in the technology and entertainment industries frequently engage in litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of IP rights. We have faced such claims in the past, and we expect to face similar claims in the future. Any IP claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to litigate or settle, and could divert management resources and attention. In the past, we have settled claims relating to infringement allegations and agreed to make payments in connection with such settlements. An adverse determination in any IP claim could require that we pay damages or stop using technologies found to be in violation of a third party s rights and could prevent us from offering our products and services to others. In order to avoid these restrictions, we may have to seek a license for the technology, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Licensors could also require us to pay significant royalties. As a result, we may be required to develop alternative non-infringing technologies, which could require significant effort and expense. If we cannot license or develop technologies for any aspects of our business found to be infringing, we may be forced to limit our product and service offerings and may be unable to compete effectively. 
 In some instances, we have contractually agreed to provide indemnifications to licensees relating to our IP. Additionally, at times we have chosen to defend our licensees from third party IP infringement claims even where such defense was not contractually required, and we may choose to take on such defense in the future. 
 Our business may be negatively impacted by disputes involving the licensing of our IP . At times, we are engaged in disputes regarding the licensing of our IP rights, including matters related to our royalty rates, whether products are royalty-bearing, and other terms of our licensing arrangements. These types of disputes can be asserted by our customers or prospective customers or by other third parties as part of negotiations with us or in private actions seeking monetary damages or injunctive relief, or in regulatory actions. In the past, licensees have threatened to initiate litigation against us based on potential antitrust claims or regarding our licensing royalty rate practices. Damages and requests for injunctive relief asserted in claims like these could be significant, and could be disruptive to our business. 
 Maintaining and enforcing our IP rights in the U.S. and abroad presents challenges to our business . Our licensing business depends in part on the uniform and consistent treatment of patent rights in the U.S. and abroad. Changes to the patent and intellectual property laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad, including the regulation regarding SEP licensing in the EU referenced above, may limit our ability to obtain, license, and enforce our rights. Additionally, court and administrative rulings may interpret existing patent laws and regulations in ways that hurt our ability to obtain, license, and enforce our patents. We face challenges protecting our IP in foreign jurisdictions, including: 
 Our ability to enforce our contractual and IP rights, especially in countries that do not recognize and enforce IP rights to the same extent as the U.S., Japan, Korea, and European countries do, which increases the risk of unauthorized use of our technologies; and 
 Because of limitations in the legal systems in many countries, our ability to obtain and enforce patents in many countries is uncertain, and we must strengthen and develop relationships with entertainment industry participants worldwide to increase our ability to enforce our IP and contractual rights without relying solely on the legal systems in the countries in which we operate.

OPERATIONS 
 Reliance on key suppliers presents certain risks to our business, many of which are beyond our control . Our reliance on suppliers for some of the key materials and components we use in manufacturing our products involves risks, including limited control over the price, timely delivery, and quality of such components, as well as delays caused by military conflicts, including those between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas, and other potential interruptions to the supply chain. Due to the relatively small volume of components we purchase for use in manufacturing, we purchase such components primarily through distributors. As such, we have relatively limited influence over the suppliers of such components to, for example, ensure continuity of supply. Although we have identified alternate suppliers for most of our key materials and components, any required changes in our suppliers could cause delays in our operations and increase our production costs. In addition, our suppliers may not be able to meet our production demands as to volume, quality, or timeliness. 
 Moreover, we rely on sole source suppliers for some of the components that we use to manufacture our products, including specific charged coupled devices, light emitting diodes, and digital signal processors. These sole source suppliers may become unable or unwilling to deliver these components to us at an acceptable cost or at all, which could force us to redesign those specific products. Our inability to obtain timely delivery of key components of acceptable quality, any significant increases in the prices of components, or the redesign of our products could result in production delays, increased costs, and reductions in shipments of our products. 
 Ensuring the quality of our products and the products in which our technology is incorporated is inherently difficult, and product quality failures can be costly . Our products, and products that incorporate our technologies, are complex and sometimes contain software or hardware errors that are not detected during testing, particularly when first introduced or when new versions are released. In addition, we have limited control over manufacturing performed by contract manufacturers, which could result in quality problems. Furthermore, our products and technologies are sometimes combined with or incorporated into products from other vendors, sometimes making it difficult to identify the source of a problem or, in certain instances, making the quality of our implementation dependent in part upon the quality of such other vendors' products. Any negative publicity or impact relating to these product problems could affect the perception of our brand and market acceptance of our products or technologies. These errors could result in a loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products or cause delays in delivering them and meeting customer demands, any of which could reduce our revenue and raise significant customer relations issues. In addition, if our products or technologies contain errors, we could be required to replace or reengineer them or rely upon parties who have incorporated our technologies into their products to implement updates to address such issues, which could cause delays or increase our costs. Moreover, if any such errors cause unintended consequences, we could incur substantial costs in defending and settling product liability claims. Although we generally attempt to contractually limit our liability, if these contract provisions are not enforced, or are unenforceable for any reason, or if liabilities arise that are not effectively limited, we could incur substantial costs in defending and settling product liability claims. 
 Production processes for our products are subject to interruption, delay, and other risks . Production difficulties or inefficiencies can interrupt production, resulting in our inability to deliver products on time or in a cost effective manner, which could harm our competitive position. While we have one production facility, we increasingly use contract manufacturers for a significant portion of our production capacity. Our reliance on contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our products involves risks, including limited control over timely delivery and quality of such products. If production of our products is interrupted, we may not be able to manufacture products on a timely basis. A shortage of manufacturing capacity for our products could negatively impact our operating results and damage our customer relationships. We may be unable to quickly adapt our manufacturing capacity to rapidly changing market conditions and a contract manufacturer may encounter similar difficulties. Likewise, we may be unable to quickly respond to fluctuations in customer demand or contract manufacturer interruptions. At times we underutilize our manufacturing facilities as a result of reduced demand for some of our products. Supply chain disruptions and extended lead times for semiconductor and electrical components may limit the availability of products and result in difficulty meeting demand. 
 We face threats to our information security systems, cyber attacks, and other cybersecurity risks, which could result in the misappropriation of sensitive information, disruption of our business, reputational damage, legal exposure, and financial losses. We rely on information technology systems in the conduct of our business, including systems designed and managed by third parties. Many of these systems contain sensitive and confidential information, including our trade secrets and proprietary business information, and personal data, as well as content and information owned by or pertaining to our customers, suppliers and business partners. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Increasingly, companies are subject to a wide 
 19 

Table of Contents 

variety of attacks on their networks and systems on an ongoing basis. Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by malicious actors including, but not limited to, nation-states and cyber criminals, malware, software bugs or other technical malfunctions, ransomware attacks, or other disruptions. This sensitive, confidential or proprietary information may be misappropriated by third-party service providers or others who may inappropriately access or exfiltrate that information from a third-party service provider's system. 
 The number and sophistication of malicious cyber attacks and disruptions that companies have experienced has increased over the past few years, including computer viruses, malware, ransomware, cyber extortion, social engineering, denial of service, supply chain attacks, and other similar attacks and disruptions. These risks could be elevated in connection with military conflicts around the world. Measures we have undertaken to protect our information technology systems may be unsuccessful in deterring or repelling malicious actors. Since techniques used by malicious actors (many of whom are highly sophisticated and well-funded) to access or sabotage networks and computer systems change frequently and often are not recognized until after they are used, we may be unable to anticipate or immediately detect these techniques. This could delay our detection and response, or impede the effectiveness of our response, our operations and ability to limit our exposure to third-party claims and other potential liability. Attacks on our systems have occurred in the past and may occur, and be successful, in the future. Such risks are also faced by our third-party service providers and others, which forms another vector for malicious attacks on our systems. 
 We also may suffer data security breaches and the unauthorized access to, misuse or acquisition of, personal data or other sensitive and confidential information as the result of intentional or inadvertent breaches or other compromises, including by our employees or service providers. Any data security breach or other incident, whether external or internal in origin, could compromise our networks and systems, create system disruptions or slowdowns and exploit security vulnerabilities of our products. Any such breach or other incident can result in the information stored on our networks and systems, or our vendors' networks and systems, being improperly accessed or acquired, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen, which could subject us to liability to our customers, suppliers, business partners and others, as well as regulatory investigations, fines or penalties, and such incidents and the public disclosure of such incidents may cause brand and reputational damage. We make efforts to detect and investigate such attempts and incidents and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools, but in some cases preventive and remedial action might not be successful. Disruptions to our information technology systems, due to outages, security breaches or other causes, could also have severe consequences to our business, including financial loss and reputational damage. 
 We must comply with a variety of data privacy regulations. Compliance with such regulations can be costly and failure to comply may affect our operations, financial performance, and business. A variety of provincial, state, national, and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data. These laws and regulations are evolving, including with respect to the development and use of AI/ML technologies, and may result in ever-increasing obligations and regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. For example, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which took effect on January 1, 2023 (with certain provisions of the CPRA having retroactive effect to January 1, 2022), as well as obligations from new privacy laws in Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Iowa, Indiana, Texas, Montana, Oregon, Delaware, Florida, and Tennessee that have taken or will take effect between 2023 and 2026, may require us to further modify certain of our information practices and could subject us to additional compliance costs and expenses. Our actual or perceived failure to adequately comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection (including regimes such as the CPRA and continuing developments in the European Union, U.K., and U.S. data privacy frameworks that are rapidly evolving) could result in regulatory fines, investigations and enforcement actions, penalties and other liabilities, claims for damages by affected individuals, and damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance, and business. Our commercial and cybersecurity insurance policies may be insufficient to insure us against these risks, and future escalations in premiums and deductibles under these policies may render them uneconomical. 
 COMPETITION 
 The markets for our technologies are highly competitive . The markets for our technologies are highly competitive, and we face competitive threats and pricing pressure in our markets. Consumers may perceive the quality of the visual and audio experiences produced by some of our competitors technologies to be equivalent or superior to the sight and sound experiences produced by our technologies. Some of our current or future competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources than we do, or may have more experience or advantages in the markets in which they compete. These competitors may also be able to offer 
 20 

Table of Contents 

integrated systems in markets for entertainment technologies on a royalty-free basis or at a lower price than our technologies, including audio, imaging, and other technologies, which could make competing technologies that we develop less attractive. These competitors may also be able to develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future products less competitive. For example, disruptive technologies such as AI/ML may significantly alter the market for our products in unpredictable ways and reduce customer demand. 
 Many of the markets for our products and for products in which our technologies are incorporated are price sensitive . The markets for the consumer entertainment products in which our technologies are incorporated are intensely competitive and price sensitive. We expect to face increased royalty pricing pressure for our technologies as we seek to drive the adoption of our technologies into online content and portable devices, such as tablets and smartphones. Such pricing pressures may be exacerbated by elevated rates of inflation, which may cause device manufacturers to take additional steps to limit costs. Retail prices for consumer entertainment products that include our audio technologies, such as home theater systems, have decreased significantly, and we expect prices to decrease for the foreseeable future. In response, OEMs have sought to reduce their product costs, which can result in additional downward pressure on the licensing fees we charge. Further, Dolby.io faces pricing pressure from other platforms offering similar solutions that may be able to offer competing services at lower prices. 
 We face competitive risks in situations where our customers are also current or potential competitors . We face competitive risks in situations where our customers are also current or potential competitors. For example, Samsung is a significant customer, but some of its technologies are competitive with some of our consumer, broadcast, and cinema technologies. Our customers may choose to use competing technologies they have developed or in which they have an interest rather than use our technologies. The existence of important customer relationships may influence which strategic opportunities we pursue, as we may forgo some opportunities in the interests of preserving a critical customer relationship. 
 We face competition from other audio formats, imaging solutions, and integrated system offerings . We believe that the success we have had licensing our audio and imaging technologies is due, in part, to the high quality of the solutions that our technologies provide and to the strength of our brand. However, both free and proprietary sound and imaging technologies are becoming increasingly prevalent, and we expect competitors to continue to enter these fields with other offerings. Furthermore, to the extent that customers perceive our competitors products as providing the same or similar advantages as our technologies at a lower or comparable price, there is a risk that these customers may treat sound and video encoding technologies as commodities, resulting in loss of status of our technologies, decline in their use, and significant pricing pressure. For example, we face competition with respect to our HDR imaging technology, Dolby Vision, and there can be no assurance that additional consumers will adopt Dolby Vision in the near future, or at all, or that we will maintain our existing customers. 
 In addition, some of our current or potential competitors may be able to offer integrated systems in certain markets for entertainment technologies, including audio and imaging, which could make competing technologies that we develop or acquire obsolete. By offering an integrated system solution, these potential competitors may also be able to offer competing technologies at lower prices than we can, which could adversely affect our operating results. 
 STRATEGIC ACTIVITIES 
 The success of our business depends on strong industry relationships . To be successful, we must maintain and grow our relationships with a broad range of industry participants, including: 
 Content creators, such as film directors, studios, mobile and online content producers, and music producers; 
 Content distributors, such as studios, film exhibitors, broadcasters, operators, streaming providers, and OTT video service providers and video game publishers; 
 Companies building real-time digital experiences that increase audience engagement; and 
 Device manufacturers. 
 Industry relationships have historically played an important role in the markets that we serve, particularly in the entertainment market. For example, sales of our products and services are particularly dependent upon our relationships with major film studios and broadcasters, and licensing of our technologies is particularly dependent upon our relationships with system licensees and IC manufacturers. Industry relationships also play an important role in other markets we serve; for instance, our relationships with companies building real-time digital experiences support the adoption of Dolby.io solutions. If we fail to maintain and strengthen our industry relationships, industry 
 21 

Table of Contents 

participants may be less likely to purchase and use our technologies, products, and services, or create content incorporating our technologies. 
 
 Our M A activity is subject to certain risks, including risks associated with integrating acquired businesses . We evaluate a wide array of possible strategic transactions, including acquisitions. We consider these types of transactions in connection with, among other things, our efforts to strengthen our audio and cinema businesses and expand beyond audio technologies. Although we cannot predict whether or not we will complete any such acquisitions or other transactions in the future, any of these transactions could be significant in relation to our market capitalization, financial condition, or results of operations. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology may create unforeseen difficulties and expenditures. Foreign acquisitions involve unique risks in addition to those mentioned above, including those related to integration of operations across different geographies, cultures, and languages; currency risks; and risks associated with the economic, political, and regulatory environment in specific countries. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, and write-offs of goodwill. Future acquisitions may also require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all, particularly during times of market volatility, rising interest rates, and general economic instability. Also, the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions may not materialize. 
 We face various risks in integrating acquired businesses, including: 
 Diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges; 
 Cultural and logistical challenges associated with integrating employees from acquired businesses into our organization; 
 Retaining employees, suppliers and customers from businesses we acquire; 
 The need to implement or improve internal controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a public company at businesses that prior to the acquisition may have lacked effective controls, procedures, and policies; 
 Possible write-offs or impairment charges resulting from acquisitions; 
 Unanticipated or unknown liabilities relating to acquired businesses; and 
 The need to integrate acquired businesses accounting, management information, manufacturing, human resources, and other administrative systems to permit effective management. 
 LEGAL AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE 
 Conducting business internationally presents a number of risks to our business, including trade restrictions and changing, unpredictable, and/or inconsistent laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate . We are dependent on international sales for a substantial amount of our total revenue. Approximately 64 , 63 and 67 of our revenue was derived outside of the U.S. in fiscal year 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively . We are subject to a number of risks related to conducting business internationally, including: 
 U.S. and foreign government trade restrictions or sanctions, including those which may impose restrictions on the importation or exportation of products, equipment, materials, software, technologies, services, on technology transfers, or on the receipt or collection of payments and distribution of royalties, and any political or economic responses or counter-responses to such restrictions or sanctions, including any such restrictions, sanctions, responses, or counter-responses related to global military conflicts or changes in US export controls related to China and other countries; 
 Changes in trade relationships, including new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargoes and other trade barriers imposed by the U.S. or by other countries; 
 Compliance with applicable international laws and regulations, including antitrust and other competition laws and laws and regulations that relate to environmental, social, and governance matters, that may change unexpectedly, differ, or conflict with laws in other countries where we conduct business, or are otherwise not harmonized with one another; 
 Foreign government taxes, regulations, and permit requirements, including foreign taxes that we may not be able to offset against taxes imposed upon us in the U.S., and other laws limiting our ability to repatriate funds to the U.S.; 
 22 

Table of Contents 

Potential adverse changes in the political, social, and/or economic stability of or conflicts within the regions in which we operate (including Europe, Russia, Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, Latin America and other emerging markets) or in diplomatic relations between governments; 
 Difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing foreign operations, including but not limited to restrictions on the ability to obtain or retain licenses required for operation, relationships with local labor unions and works councils, investment restrictions and/or requirements, and restrictions on foreign ownership of subsidiaries; 
 Adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including risks related to any interest rate swap or other hedging activities we undertake; 
 Poor recognition and enforcement of IP rights; 
 Difficulties in enforcing contractual rights; 
 Multi-jurisdictional data protection and privacy laws, including, for example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and restrictions on transferring personal data outside of a jurisdiction and potential legislation such as the Artificial Intelligence Act under consideration in the EU potentially impacting our development of products incorporating AI/ML or the use of AI/ML tools in our business; and 
 The global macroeconomic environment and potential slowing of key markets we serve. 
 Any or all of these factors may impact our ability to operate in foreign countries and our ability to develop, the demand for, and profitability of, our technologies and products, as well as our customers' products that incorporate our technologies. 
 Certain foreign governments, particularly in China, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for IP. The regulatory enforcement activities in such jurisdictions can be unpredictable, in some cases because these jurisdictions have only recently implemented competition laws. From time to time, we are the subject of requests for information, market conduct examinations, inquiries or investigations by industry groups and/or regulatory agencies in these jurisdictions. For instance, the Korean Fair Trade Commission requested information relating to our business practices in South Korea on various occasions, and initially made findings regarding the audit of a single customer. In July 2023, that determination was overturned by the Korean Civil court and thus the matter was fully resolved in Dolby s favor. In the event that we are involved in significant disputes or are the subject of a formal action by a regulatory agency, our results could be negatively impacted and we could be exposed to costly and time-consuming legal proceedings. 
 In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to us such as the FCPA and U.S. export controls. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the FCPA and U.S. export controls, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, distributors, dealers, and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies or these regulations. 
 Environmental laws and regulations may pose additional costs on and otherwise impact our products and operations . Our products and operations may be regulated under federal, state, local, and international laws governing the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management, disposal, and labeling of hazardous substances and wastes, the achievement of certain energy performance criteria, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. In addition, future environmental laws and regulations have the potential to affect our operations, increase our costs, decrease our revenue, or change the way we design or manufacture our products. We face increasing complexity in our product design as we adjust to requirements relating to the materials composition of our products. In some products, the use or avoidance of particular components that contain regulated hazardous substances may be more difficult or costly, and additional redesign efforts could result in production delays. We could incur costs, fines, and civil or criminal sanctions, third party property damage or personal injury claims, or could be required to incur substantial investigation or remediation costs, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws. 
 We are subject to regulations relating to conflict minerals and compliance with, or failure to comply with, such regulations may be costly . SEC rules require the disclosure of the use of tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold (commonly referred to as "conflict minerals") that are sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and surrounding countries. Certain of those minerals are used in the manufacturing process of electrical components that our products utilize. The potential inclusion of conflict minerals in the materials used in our products could affect the sourcing, 
 23 

Table of Contents 

availability and pricing of such materials as well as the companies we use to manufacture our products. In circumstances where sources of conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or surrounding countries are not validated as conflict free, we may take actions to change materials, designs or manufacturers to reduce the possibility that our contracts to manufacture products that contain conflict minerals finance or benefit local armed groups in the region. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers that can certify that they are offering conflict free conflict minerals, we cannot be sure that our component suppliers will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. These actions could also add engineering and other costs in connection with the manufacturing of our products. If conflict minerals used in our products are determined to finance armed conflict, even if we are not aware of such status, disclosure of such status could affect public and investor perception of Dolby and our products. 
 We may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for the minerals used in our components. Our reputation may suffer if we determine that our components contain conflict minerals that are not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our components. In addition, some customers may require that all of our products are certified to be conflict free and if we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor's products. 
 We are subject to complex and changing tax laws which may impact our financial results . We are a U.S. multi-national company that is subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. We must use judgment to determine our worldwide tax provision. We earn a significant amount of our income outside the U.S. and receive tax benefits from a portion of these foreign sales. Realizability of these benefits are contingent upon existing current tax laws and regulations in the U.S. and countries where we operate. The following could materially affect our effective tax rate: 
 Changes in geographic mix of earnings, where earnings are lower than anticipated in countries with lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher tax rates; 
 Changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; 
 Changes in transfer pricing arrangements; 
 Outcomes of tax audits; 
 Changes in accounting principles; 
 Changes in tax laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, including an increase in tax rates, or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense; or 
 Our ability to effectively implement changes to our corporate structure in response to changes in applicable tax laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. 
 Changes in U.S. tax law, including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act") and the Inflation Reduction Act, may affect our business. These provisions, their interpretations, and proposed changes to law introduced by the current administration could further impact our corporate trading structure and adversely affect our tax rate and cash flow in future years. 
 In addition, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development OECD ), an international association of many countries including the U.S., has made changes to many long-standing transfer pricing and cross-border taxation rules that affect our operations. The OECD has introduced a framework to implement a 15 global minimum corporate tax, referred to as Pillar 2 or the minimum tax directive. The minimum tax directive has been adopted by the EU for implementation by its Member States into national legislation by the end of 2023 and may be adopted by other jurisdictions, including the U.S. Further, the OECD, European Commission, EU Member States and other individual countries have made and could make additional competing jurisdictional claims over the taxes owed on earnings of multinational companies in their respective countries or regions. To the extent these actions take place in the countries that we operate, it is possible that these law changes and efforts may increase uncertainty and have an adverse impact on our effective tax rates or operations. 
 We are subject to the periodic examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and to consider potential responsive actions, but an adverse decision by tax authorities exceeding our reserves could significantly impact our financial results. 
 STOCK-RELATED ISSUES 
 The Dolby family has control over stockholder decisions as a result of the control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock by them and their affiliates . At September 29, 2023, the Dolby family and 
 24 

Table of Contents 

their affiliates owned 388,372 shares of our Class A common stock and 36,012,733 shares of our Class B common stock. As of September 29, 2023, the Dolby family and their affiliates had voting power of 99.8 of our outstanding Class B common stock, which combined with their shares of our Class A common stock, represented 85.7 of the combined voting power of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock. Under our certificate of incorporation, holders of Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share while holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share. Generally, shares of Class B common stock automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock upon transfer of such Class B common stock, other than transfers to certain specified persons and entities, including the spouse and descendants of Ray Dolby and the spouses and domestic partners of such descendants. 
 As a result of this dual class structure, the Dolby family and their affiliates will, for the foreseeable future, have significant influence over our management and affairs, and will be able to control virtually all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as mergers or other sales of our company or assets, even if they come to own considerably less than 50 of the total number of outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. Absent a transfer of Class B common stock that would trigger an automatic conversion as described above, there is no threshold or time deadline at which the shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock. 
 Moreover, the Dolby family and their affiliates may take actions in their own interests that our other stockholders do not view as beneficial. 
 Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public markets could reduce the price of our Class A common stock . If our large shareholders, officers, directors or employees sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public market, including shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of shares of Class B common stock, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline. 
 There are risks associated with our stock repurchase program . Our stock repurchase program may reduce the public float of shares available for trading on a daily basis. Such purchases may be limited, suspended, or terminated at any time without prior notice. There can be no assurance that we will buy additional shares of our Class A common stock under our stock repurchase program or that any future repurchases will have a positive impact on our stock price or EPS. Important factors that could cause us to discontinue or decrease our share repurchases include, among others, unfavorable market conditions, the market price of our Class A common stock, the nature of other investment or strategic opportunities presented to us, the rate of dilution of our equity compensation programs, our ability to make appropriate, timely, and beneficial decisions as to when, how, and whether to purchase shares under the stock repurchase program, the tax consequences of any repurchases (including the potential impact of the 1 excise tax on certain stock repurchases), and the availability of funds necessary to continue purchasing stock. If we curtail our repurchase program, our stock price may be negatively affected. 
 There are risks associated with our dividend program . We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to increase dividend payments and/or pay dividends. We are not obligated to pay dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock. In October 2014, we announced a quarterly cash dividend program for our stockholders that was initiated by our Board of Directors. Although we anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends for the foreseeable future, dividend declarations and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the Board of Directors continuing determination that the dividend policy is in the best interests of our stockholders. The dividend policy may be changed or canceled at the discretion of the Board of Directors at any time. If we do not pay dividends, the market price of our Class A common stock must appreciate for investors to realize a gain on their investment. This appreciation may not occur and our Class A common stock may in fact depreciate in value. 
 GENERAL RISK FACTORS 
 Macroeconomic conditions, including elevated inflation, rising interest rates, supply chain constraints, and the lasting effects of COVID-19 have impacted and may continue to impact the markets we serve and our business and results of operations. Our revenue and operations and the markets we serve have been, and may continue to be, impacted by macroeconomic conditions, including but not limited to, elevated inflation, rising interest rates, COVID-19-related economic impacts, supply chain constraints, increased shipping costs, international conflicts, reduced discretionary consumer spending, and reduced new product investment by our customers caused by higher interest rates and lower demand. The current macroeconomic environment has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, many of our licensees and that directly impacts, and may continue to impact, our financial results. The impacts of the current macroeconomic environment on our partners have resulted in, and may continue to cause, 
 25 

Table of Contents 

the disruption of consumer products' supply chains, shortages of certain semiconductor components, and delays in shipments, product development, and product launches. The macroeconomic conditions also impart substantial uncertainty into our operating environment, which presents additional challenges for our business. These factors and the related uncertainty may cause delays or a decrease in the adoption or implementation of our technologies into new products by partners and licensees. These conditions may impact consumer demand for devices and services and our partners ability to manufacture devices. Further, we may be negatively impacted by delays in transaction cycles and our recoveries efforts due to the noted macroeconomic conditions and related uncertainty. The future implications of these macroeconomic conditions on our business, the markets we serve, results of operations and overall financial position remain uncertain. 
 COVID-19, including the spread of variants of SARS-CoV-2, continues to impact several of our partners and it is unclear how demand for consumer products that include our technologies may change in response to, and following, the pandemic. The degree to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which cannot be predicted with any certainty, including, but not limited to, the duration and extent of the pandemic, additional actions taken by governments, businesses and consumers in response to the pandemic, additional subsequent outbreaks and variant strains, and to what extent economic and operating conditions can return to pre-pandemic conditions. Even after COVID-19 has subsided, if ever, we may continue to experience an adverse impact to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any persistent economic impacts and any recession that may occur. 
 Our results may be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates . We earn revenue, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in foreign countries using several currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international operations are translated from local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. The majority of our revenue generated from international markets is denominated in U.S. dollars, while the operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are predominantly denominated in local currencies. Therefore, our operating expenses will increase when the U.S. dollar weakens against the local currency and decrease when the U.S. dollar strengthens against the local currency. Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency result in gains or losses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. Further, our hedging programs may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse impact of currency exchange rate movements. Additional risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are described in the Foreign Currency Exchange Risk section of Part II, Item 7A " Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. " 
 Business interruptions by natural disasters and other events beyond our control could adversely impact our business . Although we maintain crisis management plans, our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters and catastrophic events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, hurricanes, typhoons, tropical storms, floods, tsunamis, fires, droughts, tornadoes, public health issues and pandemics, severe changes in climate, war, terrorism, and geopolitical unrest and uncertainties. Further, outbreaks of pandemic diseases, or the fear of such events, could provoke (and in the case of COVID-19 has provoked) responses, including government-imposed travel restrictions and limits on access to entertainment venues. These responses could negatively affect consumer demand and our business, particularly in international markets. War, including the military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas, as well as any related political or economic responses and counter-responses or otherwise by various global actors or the general effect on the global economy and supply chain, could also affect our business. For example, we have R D facilities and a large number of employees in Eastern Europe, and any business interruptions or other spillover effects from the Russia-Ukraine conflict could adversely impact our business. 
 Additionally, several of our offices, including our corporate headquarters in San Francisco, are located in seismically active regions. Because we do not carry earthquake insurance for earthquake related losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event. 
 We face intense competition for employees . In order to be successful, we must attract, develop, and retain employees, including employees to work on our growth initiatives where our current employees may lack experience with the business models and markets we are pursuing. Competition for experienced employees in our markets can be intense. In order to attract and retain employees, we must provide competitive compensation packages, including cash and equity compensation. Our equity awards include stock options, RSUs and performance-based RSUs. The future value of these awards is uncertain and depends on our stock price performance over time. In order for our

 Dolby Wootton Bassett, LLC, of which Dagmar Dolby as Trustee of the Dagmar Dolby Trust under the Dolby Family Trust Instrument dated May 7, 1999 (the "Dagmar Dolby Trust") is the sole member, and the Dagmar Dolby Trust, own a majority financial interest in real estate entities that own and from whom we may lease certain facilities located in Burbank, California and in Wootton Bassett, England. We own the remaining financial interests in these real estate entities. Specifically, we hold a 49.0 minority ownership interest in Dolby Properties Burbank, LLC, which owns a 22,000 square feet facility in Burbank that we are leasing until 2025. We also hold a 10.0 minority ownership interest in Dolby Properties, LP, which owns a 17,500 square foot facility in Wootton Bassett. We are no longer leasing the Wootton Bassett facility. 
 100 Potrero Avenue, San Francisco, California 
 Since 1980, we have leased a corporate office located at 100 Potrero Avenue, San Francisco, California from the various Dolby family trusts. The lease for this office expires on October 31, 2024, and provides approximately 70,000 square feet of space. The Dolby family trusts retain the right, which they have exercised, to sublease approximately 1,617 square feet of office space in the premises at a rental rate equal to the then current base rent per square foot paid by us plus 14 per square foot per year (reflecting estimated costs payable by us for the operation and maintenance of the premises, subject to an annual increase of 1.5 per year during each year of the sublease term). 
 We ceased occupancy of the leased space at 100 Potrero Avenue, and do not intend to re-occupy this location. We remain responsible for operating expenses, taxes, and the condition, operation, repair, maintenance, security, and management of the premises. We have also agreed to indemnify and hold the Dolby family trusts, as landlord, harmless from and against certain liabilities, damages, claims, costs, penalties, and expenses arising from our conduct related to the premises. We also have a sublease with a subtenant for the remaining lease term at 100 Potrero Avenue, pursuant to which the subtenant is required to reimburse us with respect to the foregoing expenses and taxes with respect to the subleased premises and to indemnify and hold us harmless with respect to the subleased premises in the same manner described above. 

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are involved in various legal proceedings that occasionally arise in the normal course of business activities, including claims of alleged infringement of IP rights, commercial, employment, and other matters. In our opinion, resolution of these proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our operating results or financial condition. Given the unpredictable nature of legal proceedings, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more such proceedings could materially affect our future operating results or financial condition in a particular period; however, based on the information known by us as of the date of this filing and the rules and regulations applicable to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, any such amounts are either immaterial, or it is not probable that a potential loss has been incurred or the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
 Market Information 
 Our Class A common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "DLB." Our Class B common stock is neither listed nor publicly traded. As of October 27, 2023, there were 93 holders of record of our Class A common stock and 34 holders of record of our Class B common stock. The number of Class A beneficial stockholders is substantially greater than the number of holders of record since a large portion of our common stock is held through brokerage firms. 
 Dividend Policy 
 In October 2014, we announced a quarterly cash dividend program for our stockholders that was initiated by our Board of Directors. Since the program was initiated, a quarterly dividend has been declared and paid to all eligible stockholders of Class A and Class B common stock. Most recently, on November 16, 2023, we announced a dividend in the amount of 0.30 per share, payable on December 5, 2023, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 28, 2023. 
 Dividend declarations and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend policy is in the best interests of our stockholders. The dividend policy may be changed or canceled at the discretion of the Board of Directors at any time. For additional information related to our quarterly dividend, see Note 9 " Stockholders' Equity and Stock-Based Compensation " to our consolidated financial statements and Shareholder Return in Part II, Item 7 " Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 
 Sales of Unregistered Securities 
 None. 
 Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers 
 In November 2009, we announced a stock repurchase program ("program"), providing for the repurchase of our Class A common stock. Stock repurchases under the program may be made through open market transactions, negotiated purchases, or otherwise, at times and in amounts that we consider appropriate. The timing of repurchases and the number of shares repurchased depend upon a variety of factors, including price, regulatory requirements, the rate of dilution from our equity compensation plans, and other market conditions. The program does not have a specified expiration date, and can be limited, suspended, or terminated at our discretion at any time without prior notice. Shares repurchased under the program will be returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Class A common stock. 
 The following table summarizes the initial amount of authorized repurchases as well as additional repurchases approved by our Board of Directors as of September 29, 2023 (in thousands): 
 Date of Authorization Authorization Amount Fiscal 2010: November 2009 250,000 Fiscal 2010: July 2010 300,000 Fiscal 2011: July 2011 250,000 Fiscal 2012: February 2012 100,000 Fiscal 2015: October 2014 200,000 Fiscal 2017: January 2017 200,000 Fiscal 2018: July 2018 350,000 Fiscal 2019: July 2019 350,000 Fiscal 2021: July 2021 350,000 Fiscal 2022: February 2022 250,000 Fiscal 2022: August 2022 350,000 Total 2,950,000

Stock Price Performance Graph 
 The following graph compares the total cumulative return of our Class A common stock with the total cumulative return for the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index ("NYSE Composite"), the Russell 3000 Index ("Russell 3000"), and the S P MidCap 400 Index ("S P 400") for the five fiscal years ended September 29, 2023. We have elected to replace the Russell 3000 with the S P 400 because we believe the components of the S P 400 represent more similar market capitalizations to our own and the S P 400 will provide a more meaningful comparison of our stock performance going forward. For this transitional year, both the Russell 3000 and the S P 400 are reflected in the following graph, but we do not expect to include the Russell 3000 in future years. The figures represented below assume an investment of 100 in our Class A common stock at the closing price of 69.97 on September 28, 2018, and in the NYSE Composite, Russell 3000, and S P 400 on the same date and the reinvestment of dividends into shares of common stock. The comparisons in the table are required by the SEC and are not intended to forecast or be indicative of possible future performance of our Class A common stock. This graph shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any of our filings under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

 MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS 
 The current macroeconomic environment has negatively impacted many of our licensees and that directly impacts our financial results. Our revenue has been impacted by macroeconomic conditions, including but not limited to, elevated inflation, rising interest rates, restrictions and economic impacts related to COVID-19, supply chain constraints, increased shipping costs, international conflicts, reduced discretionary consumer spending, and reduced new product investment by our customers caused by higher interest rates and lower demand. The macroeconomic conditions also impart substantial uncertainty into our operating environment, which presents additional challenges for our business. These factors and the related uncertainty may cause delays or a decrease in the adoption or implementation of our technologies into new products by partners and licensees. These conditions may impact consumer demand for devices and services and our partners ability to manufacture devices. Further, we may be negatively impacted by delays in transaction cycles and our recoveries efforts due to the noted macroeconomic conditions and related uncertainty. The future implications of these macroeconomic conditions on our business, results of operations and overall financial position remain uncertain. We continue to monitor the evolving macroeconomic environment and the impact on our business. Further discussion of the potential impacts of these macroeconomic effects on our business can be found in Part I, Item 1A " Risk Factors ." 
 EXPANDING OUR LEADERSHIP IN AUDIO AND IMAGING EXPERIENCES 
 We are focused on expanding our leadership in audio and imaging solutions for premium entertainment content by increasing the number of Dolby experiences that people can enjoy, which will drive revenue growth across the markets we serve. We can increase our value proposition and create opportunities by broadening Dolby technologies into new types of content, such as music, gaming, live sports, and user-generated content. We are increasingly making our audio and imaging technologies available for content beyond premium entertainment through Dolby.io, creating new revenue generating opportunities. We also seek to expand the reach of our technology by incorporating it into industry standards and offering licenses to our patents covering that technology, along with our partners, through patent pools. The following is a discussion of the key markets that we address and the various Dolby technologies and solutions that serve these markets. 
 LICENSING 
 The majority of our licensing revenue is derived from the licensing of audio and imaging technologies for entertainment playback. Our branded technologies are primarily comprised of DD+, Dolby Atmos, and AC-4 for audio, and Dolby Vision for imaging. Our audio technologies offered jointly through patent pools are incorporated into the AAC, HE-AAC, xHE-AAC, MPEG H and Opus standards for audio, and the AVC, HEVC, VVC and AV1 standards for imaging. Licensing revenue is primarily driven by the adoption of our technologies on devices, the number of devices shipped by licensees, and by the expansion of the number of licensees adopting our technologies. DD+, AC-4, and our AAC and HE-AAC audio patents (collectively, our "foundational audio technologies") have broad penetration across a diverse set of devices and end markets. Our revenue from these technologies is primarily driven by device shipments from licensees, and as such, is impacted by consumer spending. In the future, we expect revenue from our foundational audio technologies to generally reflect market trends in device shipments. The remaining portion of our licensing revenue is derived from offerings such as Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, our imaging patents, and Dolby Cinema. Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos have not been in the market as long as our foundational audio technologies, thus revenue growth is primarily driven by increased adoption and the addition of new licensees. Revenue from 
 32 

Table of Contents 

technologies licensed through our patent licensing model is driven primarily by our royalty share within patent pools, licensee penetration, device shipments, and the introduction of new standardized technologies and patent programs. Factors such as global supply constraints or device lifecycles may also impact licensing revenue generally. Further, in certain countries, we face difficulties enforcing our contractual and IP rights, including instances in which our licensees fail to accurately report the shipment of products using our technologies. 
 The availability of content in Dolby formats is an important part of creating the ecosystems that drive adoption of our technologies within a wide range of devices. Our audio and imaging technologies have a strong presence within movie and episodic content through adoption across content creators and streaming services. The availability of content on these platforms has driven strong adoption in devices such as TVs, STBs, and speaker devices. Our audio and imaging technologies are also widely available through many forms of distribution, including broadcast TV, streaming, and optical disc playback. 
 Major streaming partners and services such as Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV+, Amazon, Max, and Paramount+ continue to enhance content in Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. For example, in fiscal 2023, Max launched its top tier service with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. These streaming services launch local content in Dolby formats internationally. As we see an increase in new local content, we increase our value proposition for adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos across devices in all market segments. 
 We work with industry leaders to enhance these forms of content through the use of our technologies, creating additional value for the adoption of Dolby within devices such as mobile phones and tablets, PCs, gaming consoles, and automobiles. We have enhanced a broad range of content, such as music, gaming, live sports, and user-generated content. In the current fiscal year: 
 In music, the Belgian music festival Tomorrowland streamed its festival in Dolby Atmos, and released replay footage of the event on Apple Music in Dolby Atmos. Apple Music launched Apple Music Classical, a new classical music app with Dolby Atmos supported on thousands of recordings, and Amazon Music, which supports Dolby Atmos, began streaming to a wider set of devices, including more wireless speakers, soundbars, and DMAs. WYNK Music, a free music streaming service in India, has made Dolby Atmos Music available to India's Airtel's subscribers. 
 In gaming, the popular mobile game PUBG Mobile was made available to play in Dolby Atmos globally. 
 In sports, the 2022 FIFA World Cup was broadcast internationally by 12 global operators and three free-to-air terrestrial broadcasters in Dolby Vision and/or Dolby Atmos. The 2023 Indian Premier League cricket matches were available in Dolby Atmos through Disney Star and JioCinema. The 2023 French Open available for the very first time in Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos via the streaming provider Molotov TV, and the 2023 Wimbledon Championships were broadcast in Dolby Atmos on Sky Germany. The 68th UEFA Champions League games were available in Dolby Atmos. The US Open Tennis Tournament was broadcast in the UK on Sky TV in Dolby Atmos. Comcast broadcast the Superbowl LVII in Dolby Vision, and is broadcasting ESPN's college football game of the week in Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. Sky Germany began broadcasting the second Bundesliga in Dolby Atmos. Additionally, Max streamed its Major League Baseball games in Dolby Atmos. 
 In user-generated content, Vivo launched its flagship mobile phone X90 Pro+ with Dolby Vision Capture and playback, further enabling the creation of user-generated content. Weibo, one of China's largest social media platforms, began supporting Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. Audiobooks on Audible now support Dolby Atmos. Moj, India's largest short video platform, now supports Dolby Vision, and Viddsee, a short film video platform in Singapore, now supports Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. 
 The following are highlights from our fiscal 2023 and key challenges related to audio and imaging licensing, by market. Further discussion of the potential impacts of these key challenges on our business can be found in Part I, Item 1A " Risk Factors ." 
 Broadcast 
 Highlights: We have an established global presence with respect to our DD+ and HE-AAC audio technologies in broadcast services and devices. We have expanded our offerings in the broadcast market through technologies such as Dolby Atmos and AC-4, Dolby Vision, as well as AVC and HEVC imaging technologies which we license through patent pools. We work with many TV OEMs and strategic partners to enable and promote Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experiences within their TV lineups. Many such partners continue to expand their support of the 
 33 

Table of Contents 

combined Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experience. For example, at CES in January 2023, LG announced its TV lineup that supports Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, and Hisense announced several new UHD TVs and Laser TVs that support Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. Additionally in fiscal 2023, TCL announced new QLED and Mini-LED TVs with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, and that it is expanding the number of products in its lineup that support Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos in India. We also recently announced that our new feature Dolby Atmos FlexConnect will be supported by TCL's 2024 TV lineup. Acer launched TVs with DD+, Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos in India. Polytron, the largest TV OEM in Indonesia, launched TVs that support Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. Hoichoi, an Indian OTT, adopted Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision. 
 Key Challenges: Our pursuit of new licensees and further adoption of our technologies by existing licensees may be impacted by a number of factors. We must continue to present compelling reasons for consumers to demand our audio and imaging technologies, including ensuring that there is a breadth of available content in our formats and such content is being widely distributed. To the extent that OEMs do not incorporate our technologies in current and future products or our technology is not included in future broadcast industry standards, our revenue could be negatively impacted. Changing trends in the way that video content is distributed and consumed may impact our business and future growth in the broadcast market, such as the trend away from subscription-based cable and satellite television providers toward streaming services. Additionally, we face geopolitical challenges including changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, trade protection measures, and import or export licensing requirements. 
 Mobile 
 Highlights: We continue to focus on adoption of our technologies across major mobile ecosystems, including Apple and Android. HE-AAC and HEVC are widely adopted audio and video technologies across mobile devices, and we offer these technologies through our patent licensing programs. We also continue to focus on expanding adoption of our DD+, AC-4, Dolby Atmos, and Dolby Vision technologies in the mobile market. The breadth of mobile devices supporting Dolby technologies continues to increase globally. In fiscal 2023, OPPO launched the OnePlus 11, its first phone that supports Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. In addition, OPPO launched its first flagship phone with Dolby Vision Capture, and OnePlus launched its first phone with Dolby Vision playback and Dolby Atmos. Xiaomi, which now has multiple Dolby Vision Capture phone models in China, began shipping Dolby Vision Capture phone models in India, Southeast Asia, Europe and the Middle East during the year. Also in fiscal 2023, Vivo began shipping Dolby Vision Capture phones in China. Motorola became our latest partner to announce and start shipping its first Dolby Vision playback phone globally. Honor, a Chinese smart phone manufacturer, recently launched smart phones that support Dolby Vision playback. 
 Key Challenges: Growth in this market is dependent on several factors. Due to short product life cycles, mobile device OEMs can readily add or remove certain of our technologies from their devices. Our success depends on our ability to address the rapid pace of change in mobile devices, and we must continuously collaborate with mobile device OEMs to incorporate our technologies. The mobile market is heavily concentrated, so we rely on a small number of partnerships with key participants in this market. If we are unable to maintain these key relationships, we may experience a decline in mobile devices incorporating our technologies. To the extent that OEMs do not incorporate our technologies in current and future products or our technology is not included in future mobile industry standards, our revenue could be impacted. We must also continue to support the development and distribution of Dolby-enabled content via various ecosystems. Additionally, we face geopolitical challenges including changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, trade protection measures, and import or export licensing requirements. 
 Consumer Electronics 
 Highlights : We have an established presence in the home entertainment market across devices such as AVRs, soundbars, wireless and smart speakers, DMAs, and Blu-Ray players, through the inclusion of our DD+ technology, and increasingly through the inclusion of Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision. AAC and HE-AAC technologies also have broad adoption through our patent licensing programs. We continue to focus on expanding the availability of Dolby technologies to new devices. At CES in January 2023, LG and Samsung each announced 2023 soundbar lineups that support Dolby Atmos. Also in fiscal 2023, Sonos launched their premium smart speaker, the Sonos Era 300, with Dolby Atmos. Zebronics announced a new soundbar that supports Dolby Atmos to be sold in India. Jabra launched headphone products that support Dolby Atmos. XGIMI announced the 4K long throw home projector with Dolby Vision. 
 Key Challenges : We must continue to present compelling reasons for consumers to demand our technologies wherever they enjoy entertainment content, while promoting creation and broad availability of content in our formats.

To the extent that OEMs do not incorporate our technologies in current and future products, our revenue could be impacted. Additionally, we face geopolitical challenges including changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, trade protection measures, and import or export licensing requirements. 
 Personal Computers 
 Highlights : DD+ continues to enhance audio playback in both Mac and Windows operating systems, including native support in their respective Safari and Microsoft Edge browsers. Dolby's presence in these browsers enables us to reach more users through various types of content, including streaming video entertainment. A number of PCs from partners such as Apple, Lenovo, Dell, Samsung, and ASUS also support Dolby Vision and/or Dolby Atmos, with continued expansion of applications through music, streaming, and gaming. In fiscal 2023, Tencent's streaming music platform QQ Music launched Dolby Atmos support in Mac operating systems. Also in fiscal 2023, Microsoft launched its latest tablets that support Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. 
 Key Challenges : Demand for PCs has recently been declining and it remains uncertain when, if, and to what extent PC demand will return to historic levels. We must continuously collaborate and maintain our key partnerships with PC manufacturers to incorporate our technologies, and we must continue to support the development and distribution of Dolby content via various ecosystems. Additionally, we face geopolitical challenges including changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, trade protection measures, and import or export licensing requirements. 
 Other Markets 
 Highlights : DD+ is incorporated in the Xbox and PlayStation gaming consoles that support gaming content and streaming for movie and television content. The Xbox Series X and Series S gaming consoles support Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos for streaming and gaming content. Additionally, our technologies continue to be incorporated into the latest headphones by various OEMs. In fiscal 2023, Sony Interactive Entertainment announced that PlayStation 5 is unlocking support for compatible Dolby Atmos-enabled living room devices with the latest PS5 system software beta, available to beta participants in select markets. Sony Interactive Entertainment also announced support for Dolby Atmos on the PS5. 
 We also generate revenue from the automotive industry through disc playback devices as well as other elements of the entertainment system, and through the adoption of Dolby Atmos Music. In fiscal 2023, Mercedes-Benz adopted Dolby Atmos and Dolby Atmos Music in several of its car models, and continues to add our technologies to more models and ship more models globally. Also in fiscal 2023, Chinese electric car manufacturer Li Auto and NetEase Cloud Music announced a collaboration to deliver Dolby Atmos Music in Li Auto cars. Additionally, Guangzhou Automobile Group, a large Chinese auto manufacturer, announced the launch of a new sport sedan that features Dolby Atmos, and NIO and Lotus launched cars that support Dolby Atmos beyond the domestic Chinese market into Europe as well. Yangwang announced its first car, the Yangwang U8 model, supporting Dolby Atmos, our fifth automotive OEM this year. 
 Key Challenges : Consumer demand for devices in the gaming industry is impacted by anticipation of console refresh cycles, which could result in fluctuations in our revenue. In addition, the gaming console market has competition from mobile devices and gaming PCs, which have faster refresh cycles and appeal to a broader consumer base. Automotive revenue has been negatively impacted by a decline in the portion of cars that have optical disc playback. Shortages of certain semiconductor components could result in lower implementation of our technologies in vehicles by automotive manufacturers. Our revenue growth will be impacted if OEMs do not incorporate our technologies in their latest products, which can be more prominent in industries with longer development cycles such as the automotive industry. Additionally, we face geopolitical challenges including changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, trade protection measures, and import or export licensing requirements. 
 Included within Other Markets is also licensing revenue from audio and imaging technologies used to create Dolby experiences through Dolby Cinema. 
 Dolby Cinema 
 Highlights: We continue to expand our global presence for Dolby Cinema, with sites located in the U.S. and internationally. The breadth of motion pictures for Dolby Cinema continues to grow with over 500 theatrical titles in both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos having been announced or released from all of the major studios as of the end of fiscal 2023. 
 35 

Table of Contents 

Key Challenges: Although the premium large format market for the cinema industry has been growing, Dolby Cinema competes with other existing offerings. Our success depends on our partners and their success, and our ability to differentiate our offering, deploy new sites, and attract and retain a global viewing audience. In addition, the success of our Dolby Cinema offering is tied to global box office performance generally. COVID-19 has had a significant effect on theatrical exhibition, which could impact the financial viability of our key partners. The response to COVID-19 has had a negative impact on our cinema-related revenue and consumer demand, although consumer demand for the cinema has been improving. It is uncertain whether consumer demand for the cinema will return to previous levels. Additionally, the recently concluded strikes by the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA effectively halted the production, release and promotion of certain films for an extended period. The resulting impacts of those stoppages may result in near-term decreases in box office receipts and our cinema-related revenue. 
 PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 
 A majority of our products and services revenue is derived from the sale of audio and imaging products for the cinema, television, broadcast, communication, and entertainment industries. Revenue from Dolby.io is also included in products and services. 
 Cinema Products and Services 
 Highlights : To help enable the playback of content in Dolby formats, we offer a range of servers, which include the IMS3000 (an integrated imaging and audio server with Dolby Atmos), and audio processors, such as the CP950, to cinema exhibitors globally. Dolby Atmos has been adopted broadly across studios, content creators, post-production facilities, and exhibitors. As of the end of fiscal 2023, there are over 7,500 Dolby Atmos screens installed or committed and over 2,800 Dolby Atmos theatrical titles have been announced or released. 
 We also offer a variety of other cinema products, such as the Dolby Multichannel Amplifier and our high-power flexible line of speakers. These products allow us to offer exhibitors a more complete Dolby Atmos solution that is often more cost effective than other commercially available options. 
 Key Challenges: Demand for our cinema products is dependent upon our partners and their success in the market, industry and economic cycles, box office performance, and our ability to develop and introduce new technologies, further our relationships with content creators, and promote new cinematic audio and imaging experiences. A significant portion of our growth opportunity lies in international markets, which are subject to geopolitical risks. Additionally, weakness in general economic conditions due to inflation, recession, pandemic or other worsening economic conditions could have a negative impact on our cinema-related revenue due to reduced consumer discretionary spending. We may also be faced with pricing pressures or competing technologies, which would affect our revenue. We have also experienced supply chain shortages and increased shipping costs that have created challenges to maintain the sufficient supply of cinema products to meet the demand in the market. In addition, supply chain constraints may impact our ability to provide cinema products and services to our customers. COVID-19 has also negatively impacted the financial health of our cinema customers and partners. In addition, the recently concluded strikes by the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA effectively halted the production, release and promotion of certain films for an extended period. The resulting impacts of those stoppages may lead to decreased box office receipts in the near term, which could potentially impact exhibitors' willingness and ability to invest in our cinema products . 
 Dolby.io 
 Highlights: We are focused on bringing Dolby s decades of sight and sound technology to a broader range of media content and digital experiences. We are expanding our addressable market to enhance a broader range of content, by offering solutions to companies building real-time digital experiences that increase audience engagement. Our solution provides the capability to stream high quality audiovisual content in ultra-low latency which reduces the delay between the action and the viewer. 
 Content being delivered with almost no delay enables our customers to create real-time interaction in their apps and services. This lifelike interaction is essential to the experiences companies, particularly in sports and entertainment, are creating. 
 Over time, we believe this way of delivering and engaging with content will be used more broadly. 
 Key Challenges: Dolby.io is an early-stage business, and it is uncertain when or if it will be a material revenue driver. Our success in this market will depend on adoption from companies building real-time digital experiences that 
 36 

Table of Contents 

increase audience engagement, the volume of usage of the services and our ability to monetize our services. In addition, the development and maintenance needed to provide a reliable and scalable platform may require us to develop new skills internally for our current employees or hire external specialized talent.

 Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to establish accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses. The SEC considers an accounting policy and estimate to be critical if it is both important to a company s financial condition or results of operations and requires significant judgment by management in its application. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments, and estimates, and historically, actual results have not differed significantly from them. If actual results or events differ materially from our judgments and estimates, our reported financial condition and results of operation for future periods could be materially affected. We have reviewed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 We derive our revenue primarily from the licensing of our technologies and patents . In determining how revenue should be recognized, a five-step process is used, which requires judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process. Generally, revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products, services or IP rights to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products, services or licensing of the IP rights. The primary judgments include estimating sales-based revenue in advance of receiving statements from our licensees, estimating variable consideration, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, and determining whether the performance obligations are distinct, and allocating consideration accordingly. 
 Most of our licensing arrangements are structured as sales-based whereby we are paid a unit-based royalty. The unit-based sales data that triggers the royalty obligation is generally reported to us in the quarter after triggering the royalty obligation. We apply the royalty exception to these arrangements, which requires that we recognize sales-based royalties at the later of when the sales occur based on our estimates or the completion of our performance obligations. Our estimates of royalty-based revenue take into consideration the macroeconomic effect of global events, such as inflation, elevated interest rates, economic impacts related to COVID-19, or other economic conditions, which may impact supply chain activities as well as demand for shipments. These estimates also involve the use of historical data and judgment for several key attributes including industry estimates of expected shipments, the percentage of markets using our technologies, and average sale prices. Generally, our estimates represent the current period s shipments for which we expect our licensees to submit royalty statements in the following quarter. Upon receipt of royalty statements from the licensees with the actual reporting of sales-based royalties that we previously estimated, we record a favorable or unfavorable adjustment based on the difference, if any, between estimated and actual sales. 
 We also enter into fixed and guaranteed licensing fees arrangements, which require the licensee to pay a fixed, non-refundable fee. In these cases, control is transferred and the transaction price - the amount we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the license right - is recognized upon the later of contract execution or the effective date. Transaction price is determined at contract execution and, to the extent variable consideration applies, is updated each subsequent reporting period until the completion of the contract. We evaluate whether other distinct performance obligations exist, such as PCS, and determine the stand-alone selling price. We do so by considering actual stand-alone sales in addition to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies, customer specific information and industry technology lifecycles, internal conditions such as cost and pricing practices, or applying the residual approach method when the selling price of the good, most commonly a license, is highly variable or uncertain. In addition, we evaluate whether a significant financing component exists when we recognize revenue in advance of customer payments that occur over time and extend beyond one year. In general, if the payment arrangements extend beyond the first year of the contract, we treat a portion of the payments as a financing component. The discount rate used for each arrangement reflects the rate that would be used in a separate financing transaction between us and the licensee at contract inception and takes into account the credit characteristics of the licensee and market interest rates as of the date of the agreement. If we assess the financing component to be significant to the contract, the amount of fixed fee revenue recognized at the beginning of the license term will be reduced by the calculated

financing component. The portion related to the financing component is recorded as interest income, and is not material to our consolidated financial statements.

Amounts displayed, except percentages, are in thousands. 
 Revenue and Gross Margin 
 Licensing 
 Licensing revenue consists of fees earned from licensing our technologies to customers who incorporate them into their products and services to enable and enhance audio and imaging capabilities. The technologies that we license are either internally developed, acquired, or licensed from third parties. We also generate administrative fees for managing patent pools on behalf of third party patent owners through our subsidiary, Via LA. A significant portion of our licensing revenue pertains to customer-shipment royalties that we recognize based on estimates of our licensees shipments. To the extent that shipment data reported by licensees differs from estimates we made and recorded, we recognize an adjustment to revenue for such difference in the period we receive the reported shipment data. 
 Our cost of licensing consists mainly of amortization of certain purchased intangible assets and intangible assets acquired in business combinations, depreciation, third party royalty obligations, and patent pool fees.

 Products and Services 
 Products revenue is generated from the sale of audio and imaging hardware and software products for the cinema, television, broadcast and entertainment industries. Also included in products revenue are amounts relating to certain Dolby Cinema arrangements that are considered sales-type leases that involve fixed or minimum fees. Cost of products includes materials, labor, manufacturing overhead, amortization of certain intangible assets, and certain third party royalty obligations. 
 Services revenue consists of fees charged to support theatrical and television production for cinema exhibition, broadcast, and home entertainment, including equipment training and maintenance, mixing room alignment, equalization, as well as audio, color, and light image calibration. Services revenue also includes PCS for products sold and equipment installed at Dolby Cinema theaters operated by exhibitor partners and support for the implementation of our technologies into products manufactured by our licensees. Also included in services revenue are amounts generated through Dolby.io. Cost of services consists of personnel and personnel-related costs for providing our professional services, software maintenance and support, external contractors, and other direct expenses incurred on behalf of customers.

 On August 7, 2019, Intertrust Technologies ("Intertrust") filed complaints against each of our customers AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., Cinemark Holdings, Inc., and Regal Entertainment Group in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that the use of systems including certain cinema products, which were supplied under commercial agreements that we acquired as a part of an acquisition in 2014, infringed various Intertrust patents, and seeking damages based on the revenues of the defendants. We recorded 34.4 million in fiscal 2022 within G A expenses, reflecting a settlement payment and an immaterial accrual. We believe that these amounts fully resolve all claims relating to Intertrust s patent assertions.

Restructuring Charges 
 Restructuring charges recorded as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations represent costs associated with separate restructuring plans implemented in various fiscal periods. The extent of our costs arising as a result of these actions, including fluctuations in related balances between fiscal periods, is based on the nature of activities under the various plans.

 In June 2023, we implemented a focused restructuring plan, primarily consisting of workforce reductions and facility consolidations to improve execution in alignment with our strategy and to reduce our cost structure through improved utilization of our global infrastructure. As a result of these actions, we recorded restructuring charges of 10.9 million in severance and other related benefits offered to approximately 130 impacted employees and 6.9 million related to facility consolidation in New York, NY. 
 In September 2023, we initiated a focused restructuring plan with the purpose of focusing our resources on our highest strategic priorities. We recorded expense of 13.4 million in severance and other related benefits offered to approximately 160 impacted employees. The remaining components of this plan are expected to be completed in November 2023, resulting in an additional charge of approximately 5.0 million in severance and other termination benefits. In conjunction with focusing our resources on our top strategic priorities, we recorded an impairment loss of 16.9 million related primarily to internally developed software for projects we are no longer pursuing. 
 For additional information on our Restructuring programs, see Note 13 " Restructuring " to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Other Income/Expense 
 Other income/expense primarily consists of interest income earned on cash and investments and the net gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, derivative instruments, our proportionate share of net income or losses from our equity method investment, and gains and losses on the sales of marketable securities from our investment portfolio.

 Income Taxes 
 Our effective tax rate is based on our fiscal year results and is affected by several factors. These include the current statutory rates in our domestic and foreign jurisdictions, the relative income earned in our foreign jurisdictions, and nonrecurring items such as changes to our unrecognized tax benefits that may occur in but are not necessarily consistent between periods. For additional information related to effective tax rates, see Note 12 " Income Taxes" to our consolidated financial statements.

LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and investments, as well as cash flows from operations. We believe that these sources will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next twelve months. 
 As of September 29, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 745.4 million, which consisted of cash and highly liquid money market funds. In addition, we had short and long-term investments of 237.0 million, which primarily consisted of government bonds, corporate bonds, municipal debt securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and U.S. agency securities. 
 The following table presents selected financial information as of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022 (in thousands): September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 Cash and cash equivalents 745,364 620,127 Short-term investments 139,148 189,213 Long-term investments 97,812 102,514 Accounts receivable, net 262,245 243,593 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 372,324 244,408 Working capital 1,065,578 1,033,376 
 Capital Expenditures and Uses of Capital 
 Our capital expenditures consist of purchases of land, building, building fixtures, laboratory equipment, office equipment, computer hardware and software, leasehold improvements, and production and test equipment. Additionally, included in capital expenditures are amounts associated with Dolby Cinema locations. We continue to invest in S M and R D to promote the overall growth of our business and technological innovation. 
 We retain sufficient cash holdings to support our operations and we also purchase investment-grade securities diversified among security types, industries, and issuers. We have used cash generated from our operations to fund a variety of activities related to our business in addition to our ongoing operations, including business expansion and growth, acquisitions, and repurchases of our Class A common stock. We have historically generated significant cash from operations. However, these cash flows and the value of our investment portfolio could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, as described in Part I, Item 1A " Risk Factors ." 
 Shareholder Return 
 We have returned cash to stockholders through both repurchases of Class A common stock under our repurchase program initiated in fiscal 2010 and our quarterly dividend program initiated in fiscal 2015. Refer to Note 9 " Stockholders' Equity and Stock-Based Compensation " to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of dividend payments made under the program during fiscal 2023 and additional information regarding our stock repurchase program. 
 Stock Repurchase Program. Our stock repurchase program was approved in fiscal 2010, and since then we have completed approximately 2.7 billion of stock repurchases under the program. 
 The Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS and Science Act were signed into law in August 2022. The Inflation Reduction Act introduced a one percent non-deductible excise tax on certain public company stock buybacks made after December 31, 2022. We do not currently expect the excise tax to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position, and its ongoing impact will be dependent on the extent of our future net stock repurchase activities.

Quarterly Dividend Program. During fiscal 2015, we initiated a recurring quarterly cash dividend program for our stockholders. For fiscal 2023, quarterly dividends of 0.27 per share were paid on our Class A and Class B common stock to eligible stockholders of record. 
 Cash Flows Analysis 
 For the following comparative analysis performed for each of the sections of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the significant factors identified as the leading drivers contributing to the fluctuation are presented in descending order of their impact relative to the overall change (in thousands). 
 Operating Activities Fiscal Year Ended September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities 367,081 318,576 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased 48.5 million in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to the following: Factor Impact On Cash Flows Operating assets and liabilities Higher inflows due to lower accounts receivable and higher operating lease liabilities, partially offset by lower accounts payable and accrued liabilities and lower income taxes 
 Investing Activities Fiscal Year Ended September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities 54,206 (295,935) 
 Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities was 350.1 million higher in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to the following: Factor Impact On Cash Flows Purchase of Investments Lower outflows for the purchase of marketable investment securities Proceeds from Investments Higher inflows from the sale and maturity of marketable investment securities Business Combinations Inflows due to restricted cash balances acquired in connection with the MPEG LA acquisition 
 Financing Activities Fiscal Year Ended September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 Net cash used in financing activities (236,812) (610,558) 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 373.7 million lower in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to the following: Factor Impact On Cash Flows Share Repurchases Lower outflows due to lower common stock repurchases Common Stock Issuance Lower inflows from employee stock option exercises

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 The following table presents a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of September 29, 2023 (in thousands): Payments Due By Fiscal Period 1 Year 2 - 3 Years 4 - 5 Years More Than 5 Years Total Naming rights 12,794 26,598 17,176 35,674 92,242 Purchase obligations 29,934 4,667 34,601 Donation commitments 1,718 232 172 332 2,454 Total 44,446 31,497 17,348 36,006 129,297 
 Naming Rights. We are party to agreements for naming rights of certain facilities, most significantly for naming rights and related benefits with respect to the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, California, the location of the Academy Awards . The term of the agreement is 20 years, over which we will make payments on a semi-annual basis until fiscal 2032. We also hold the naming rights to Dolby Live at the Park MGM in Las Vegas, Nevada. Dolby Live is a fully integrated performance venue offering live concerts in Dolby Atmos. For additional details regarding our naming rights commitments, see Note 14 " Commitments and Contingencies " to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Operating Leases. Operating lease payments represent our commitments for future minimum rent made under non-cancelable leases for office space, including those payable to our principal stockholder and portions attributable to the noncontrolling interests in our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. For additional details regarding our leases, see Note 7 " Leases " to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Purchase Obligations. Purchase obligations primarily consist of our non-cancelable commitments made under agreements to purchase goods and services related to Dolby Cinema and for purposes that include information technology and telecommunications, marketing and professional services, and manufacturing and other R D activities. 
 Donation Commitments. Our donation commitments relate to non-cancelable obligations that consist of maintenance services and installation of imaging and audio products in exchange for various marketing, branding, and publicity benefits. For additional details regarding our donation commitments, see Note 14 " Commitments and Contingencies " to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Unrecognized Tax Benefits. As of September 29, 2023, we had an accrued liability for unrecognized tax benefits without interest, penalties, and related deferred tax assets, totaling 76.3 million. We are unable to estimate when any cash settlement with a taxing authority might occur and, therefore, have not reflected these anticipated future outflows in the table above. 
 Indemnification Clauses 
 We are party to certain contractual agreements under which we have agreed to provide indemnification of varying scope and duration to the other party relating to our licensed IP. Since the terms and conditions of the indemnification clauses do not explicitly specify our obligations, we are unable to reasonably estimate the maximum potential exposure for which we could be liable. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain employees, and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations. For additional details regarding indemnification clauses within our contractual agreements, see Note 14 " Commitments and Contingencies " to our consolidated financial statements. 
 In fiscal 2023, there have been no material changes in either our off-balance sheet financing arrangements or contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business, and we did not enter into any off-balance sheet arrangements that are expected to have a material effect on Dolby's liquidity or the availability of capital resources. 

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 As of September 29, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 745.4 million, which consisted of cash and highly liquid money market funds. In addition, we had both short and long-term investments of 237.0 million, which consisted of corporate bonds, government bonds, municipal debt securities, U.S. agency securities, commercial paper, and certificates of deposit. Our investment policy is focused on the preservation of capital and support for our 
 44 

Table of Contents 

liquidity requirements. Under the policy, we invest in highly rated securities with a minimum credit rating of A- while limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer other than the U.S. government. As of September 29, 2023, the weighted-average credit quality of our investment portfolio was AA-, with a weighted-average maturity of approximately eleven months. We do not invest in financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we use leveraged financial instruments. We utilize external investment managers who adhere to the guidelines of our investment policy. 
 The investments within our fixed-income portfolio are subject to fluctuations in interest rates, which could affect our financial position, and to a lesser extent, results of operations. Based on our investment portfolio balance as of September 29, 2023, hypothetical changes in interest rates of 1 and 0.5 would have an impact on the carrying value of our portfolio of approximately 1.8 million and 0.9 million, respectively. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 We maintain business operations in foreign countries, most significantly in Australia, China, Germany, Ireland, Poland, and the U.K. Additionally, a portion of our business is conducted outside of the U.S. through subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, most notably: 
 Australian Dollar 
 British Pound 
 Chinese Yuan 
 Euro 
 Polish Zloty 
 As a result, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international operations are translated from local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. The majority of our revenue generated from international markets is denominated in U.S. dollars, while the operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are predominantly denominated in local currencies. Therefore, our operating expenses will increase when the U.S. dollar weakens against the local currency and decrease when the U.S. dollar strengthens against the local currency. Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency result in gains or losses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. Our foreign operations are subject to the same risks present when conducting business internationally, including, but not limited to, changes in economic conditions and geopolitical climate, differing tax structures, foreign exchange rate volatility and other regulations and restrictions. 
 We also enter into forward currency contracts exclusively designated as cash flow hedges, which have a maturity of thirteen months or less, to reduce the impact of currency volatility on U.S. dollar operating expenses. The gains and losses from the effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as a component of AOCI, until the hedged item is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, with the corresponding hedged item. Amounts reclassified are recorded to the same line item in the consolidated statements of operations as the impact of the hedge transaction, concurrently with the hedged costs. 
 The pre-tax gain attributed to the effective portion of cash flow hedges recognized in AOCI was 4.9 million in fiscal 2023. The pre-tax loss attributed to the effective portion of cash flow hedges recognized in AOCI was 2.6 million in fiscal 2022. 
 The pre-tax effective portion of the losses reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations was 0.7 million in fiscal 2023, and the pre-tax effective portion of the loss reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations was 2.1 million in fiscal 2022. 
 We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against assets and liabilities for which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure and selected anticipated expenses. The contracts hedging receivables and payables are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to other income/(expense), net, in our consolidated statements of operations. The contracts hedging foreign currency denominated operating expenses are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to other comprehensive income until the hedged expenses are reported in our consolidated statements of operations.

As of September 29, 2023, the outstanding derivative instruments had maturities of equal to or less than 12 months. As of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the total notional amounts of outstanding contracts were 134.8 million and 130.8 million, respectively. 
 For additional information related to our foreign currency forward contracts, see Note 2 " Summary of Significant Accounting Policies " to our consolidated financial statements. 
 A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign currency forward contracts as of September 29, 2023. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10 shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. For these forward contracts, duration modeling was used where hypothetical changes were made to the spot rates of the currency. A 10 increase in the value of the U.S. dollar would lead to a decrease in the fair value of our financial instruments by 7.0 million. Conversely, a 10 decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar would result in an increase in the fair value of these financial instruments by 7.0 million.

 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 Dolby Laboratories, Inc.: 
 Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dolby Laboratories, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 29, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 29, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 The Company acquired MPEG LA, L.L.C. during fiscal 2023. Management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2023, MPEG LA, L.L.C. s internal control over financial reporting which represented 12 of total assets and less than 1.5 of total revenue included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended September 29, 2023. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of MPEG LA, L.L.C.. 
 Basis for Opinions 
 The Company s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 48 

Table of Contents 

A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 Assessment of revenue estimate related to sales-based licensing arrangements 
 As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, revenue is derived principally from the licensing of technologies and patents to various types of licensees. The Company recognized total licensing revenue of 1.2 billion for the year ended September 29, 2023. The Company estimates and records sales-based licensing revenue from its licensees shipments in the same period in which those shipments occur. After receiving the royalty statements from the licensees, which is generally in the quarter after those shipments have occurred, the Company will record an adjustment based on the difference between the estimated and actual sales-based licensing revenue. 
 We identified the assessment of the revenue estimates related to the Company s sales-based licensing arrangements as a critical audit matter. Auditor judgement was required to evaluate the Company s estimation of sales-based licensing revenue, which included the use of historical data, industry estimates of expected shipments, market penetration, and average sales prices. 
 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company s sales-based licensing revenue estimation process. This included controls related to the review of (1) historical data, (2) third-party industry expectations for shipments of units, (3) the estimated percentage of market penetration, and (4) estimated average sales prices. We tested the Company s process to develop the sales-based licensing revenue estimate. Specifically, we evaluated the sources of the historical data and assumptions that the Company used by considering their relevance and reliability. We performed sensitivity analyses over certain assumptions to assess the impact on the sales-based licensing revenue estimate of reasonably possible changes to the assumptions. In addition, we compared the Company s historical sales-based licensing revenue estimates to actual sales-based licensing royalties received from licensees during the year, to assess the Company s ability to accurately estimate.

 of our total portfolio to any one issuer, except for the U.S. Treasury, and we believe no significant concentration risk exists with respect to these investments. We also mitigate counterparty risk through entering into derivative contracts with high-credit-quality financial institutions. Actual or potential defaults of one or more financial institutions could impact our results of operations or financial position, and make it challenging to find alternative qualified counterparties. 
 The majority of our licensing revenue is generated from customers outside of the U.S. We manage the credit risk posed by non-U.S. customers by performing regular evaluations of the creditworthiness of our licensing customers and recognize revenue in accordance with US GAAP.

 We also hold an investment in an equity security of a privately-held company without a readily determinable fair value. We elected to account for this investment using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. We perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. This equity security is included within long-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets.

 We may encounter scenarios where assets we acquire may deviate from the established standard useful life provided above. Such occurrences are evaluated on a case by case basis, and are assigned a useful life commensurate with the facts and circumstances associated with the specific PP E being acquired. We capitalize certain costs incurred during the construction phase of a project or asset into construction-in-progress until the construction process is complete. Once the related asset is placed into service, we transfer its carrying value into the appropriate fixed asset category and begin depreciating the value over its useful life. 
 Equipment Provided Under Operating Leases. In arrangements that we assess as operating leases, we recognize our equipment installed at third-party sites as PP E and depreciate the asset on a straight-line basis.

Foreign Currency Activities 
 Foreign Currency Translation. We maintain business operations in foreign countries. We translate the assets and liabilities of our international subsidiaries, the majority of which are denominated in non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses of these subsidiaries are translated using the average rates for the period. Gains and losses from these translations are included in AOCI within stockholders equity. 
 Foreign Currency Transactions. Certain of our foreign subsidiaries transact in currencies other than their functional currency. Therefore, we re-measure non-functional currency assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries using exchange rates at the end of each period. As a result, we recognize foreign currency transaction and re-measurement gains and losses, which are recorded within other income, net in our consolidated statements of operations. ) )

 Cash Flow Hedges. We also enter into forward currency contracts exclusively designated as cash flow hedges, which have a maturity of thirteen months or less, to reduce the impact of currency volatility on U.S. dollar operating expenses. As of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the outstanding derivative instruments had maturities of equal to or less than 12 months, and the total notional amounts of outstanding contracts were million and million, respectively. The gains and losses from the effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as a component of AOCI, until the hedged item is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, with the corresponding hedged item. Amounts reclassified are recorded to the same line item in the consolidated statements of operations as the impact of the hedge transaction, concurrently with the hedged costs. 
 The pre-tax gain attributed to the effective portion of cash flow hedges recognized in AOCI was million in fiscal 2023. The pre-tax loss attributed to the effective portion of cash flow hedges recognized in AOCI was million in fiscal 2022. The pre-tax effective portion of the losses reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations was million and million in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively.

or less. 
 D. Allocation of Transaction Price to Distinct Performance Obligations in a Contract 
 For our sales-based royalties where the license is the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we present all revenue as licensing. 
 For revenue arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, we determine the stand-alone selling price for each distinct performance obligation based on the actual selling prices made to customers. If the performance obligation is not sold separately, we estimate the stand-alone selling price. We do so by considering market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies, customer specific information and industry technology lifecycles, internal conditions such as cost and pricing practices, or applying the residual approach method when the selling price of the good, most commonly a license, is highly variable or uncertain. 
 Once the transaction price, including any variable consideration, has been determined, we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations identified in the contract and recognize revenue as or when control is transferred for each distinct performance obligation. 
 E. Revenue Recognition as Control is Transferred to a Customer 
 We generate our licensing revenue by licensing our technologies and patents to various types of licensees, such as chip manufacturers ("implementation licensees"), consumer product manufacturers, software vendors, and communications service providers. Our revenue recognition policies for each of these arrangements are summarized below. 
 Initial fees from implementation licensees. Implementation licensees incorporate our technologies into their chipsets that, once approved by Dolby, are available for purchase by OEMs for use in end-user products. Implementation licensees only pay us a nominal initial fee on contract execution as consideration for the ongoing services that we provide to assist in their implementation process. Revenue from these initial fees is recognized ratably over the contractual term as a component of licensing revenue. 
 Sales-based licensing fees. In our royalty bearing licensing agreements with OEMs, control is transferred upon the later of contract execution or the contract s effective date. We apply the royalty exception, which requires that we recognize sales-based royalties when the sales occur based on our estimates. These estimates involve the use of historical data and judgment for several key attributes including industry estimates of expected shipments, the percentage of markets using our technologies, and average sale prices. Generally, our estimates represent the current period s shipments to which we expect our licensees to submit royalty statements within the following two quarters. Upon receipt of royalty statements from the licensees with the actual reporting of sales-based royalties that we estimated previously, we record a favorable or unfavorable adjustment based on the difference, if any, between estimated and actual sales. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we recorded a favorable adjustment of approximately million, which was primarily related to shipments that occurred in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 (July through September) and largely based on actual royalty statements received from licensees. In the second quarter of fiscal 
 61 

Table of Contents 

million, and in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we recorded a favorable adjustment of million and million, respectively, each primarily related to shipments that occurred in the prior two quarters, and largely based on actual royalty statements received from licensees. 
 Fixed and guaranteed licensing fees. In certain cases, our arrangements require the licensee to pay fixed, non-refundable fees. In these cases, control is transferred and fees are recognized upon the later of contract execution or the effective date. Additionally and separate from initial fees from implementation licensees, our sales- and usage-based licensing agreements include a nominal fee, which is also recognized at a point in time in which control of the IP has been transferred. Revenue from these arrangements is included as a component of licensing revenue. 
 Recoveries. Through compliance efforts, we identify misreported licensed activity related to non-current periods. We may record a favorable or unfavorable revenue adjustment in connection with the findings from these compliance efforts generally upon resolution with the licensee through agreement of the findings, or upon receipt of the licensee s correction statement. Revenue from these arrangements is included as a component of licensing revenue. 
 We undertake activities aimed at identifying potential unauthorized uses of our technologies, which, when successful, result in the recognition of revenue. Recoveries stem from third parties who agree to remit payments to us based on past use of our technology. In these scenarios, a legally binding contract did not exist at the time of use of our technology, and therefore, we recognize revenue recoveries upon execution of the agreement as that is the point in time at which a contract exists and control is transferred. This revenue is classified as licensing revenue. 
 In general, we classify legal costs associated with activities aimed at identifying potential unauthorized uses of our technologies, auditing existing licensees, and on occasion, pursuing litigation as S M in our consolidated statements of operations. 
 We recognize licensing revenue gross of withholding taxes, which our licensees remit directly to their local tax authorities, and for which we receive a partial foreign tax credit in our income tax provision. 
 In addition to our licensing arrangements, we also enter into arrangements to deliver products and services. 
 Product Sales. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized when the customer obtains control of the promised good or service, which is generally upon shipment. Payments are generally made within 90 days of sale. 
 Services. We provide various services, such as engineering services related to movie soundtrack print mastering, equipment training and maintenance, mixing room alignment, equalization, and image calibration, which we bill on a fixed fee and time and materials basis. Most of these services are of a short duration and are recognized as control of the performance obligations are transferred which is when the related services are performed. 
 Cloud Services. We provide access to audio and video APIs through our developer platform as well as cloud encoding services, generally, on either a consumption or subscription basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis is recognized when the customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services. 
 Collaborative Arrangements. We collaborate with established cinema exhibitors to offer Dolby Cinema, a branded premium cinema offering for movie audiences. Under such collaborations, Dolby and the exhibitor are both active participants, and share the risks and rewards associated with the business. Accordingly, these collaborations are governed by revenue sharing arrangements under which Dolby receives revenue based on box office receipts, reported to Dolby by exhibitor partners on a monthly or quarterly basis, our proprietary designs and trademarks as well as for the use of our equipment at the exhibitor's venue. The use of our product solution meets the definition of a lease, and for the related portion of Dolby's share of revenue, we apply ASC 842, Leases , and recognize revenue based on monthly box office reports from exhibitors. Our revenue share is recognized as licensing revenue in our consolidated statements of operations. 
 In addition, we also enter into hybrid agreements where a portion of our revenue share involves guaranteed payments, which in some cases result in classifying the arrangement as a sales-type lease. In such arrangements, we consider control to transfer at the point in time to which we have installed and tested the equipment, at which point we record such guaranteed payments as product revenue.

Deferred revenue, which is a component of contract liabilities, represents amounts that are ultimately expected to be recognized as revenue, but for which we have yet to satisfy the performance obligation. On September 29, 2023, we had million of remaining performance obligations, of which we expect to recognize as revenue in fiscal 2024, in fiscal 2025, and the balance of in fiscal years beyond 2025.

 G. Contract Balances 
 Our contract assets represent rights to consideration from licensees for the use of our IP that we have estimated in a given period in the absence of receiving actual royalty statements from licensees. These estimates reflect our best judgment at that time, and are developed using a number of inputs, including historical data, industry estimates of expected shipments, anticipated sales price and performance, and third party data supporting the percentage of markets using our technologies. In the event that our estimates differ from actual amounts reported, we record an adjustment in the quarter in which the royalty statement is received, which is typically the quarter following our estimate. Actual amounts reported are typically paid within 60 days following the end of the quarter of shipment. The main drivers for change in the contract assets account are variances in quarterly estimates, and to a lesser degree,

 Fair Value Hierarchy. Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We minimize the use of unobservable inputs and use observable market data, if available, when determining fair value. We classify our inputs to measure fair value using the following three-level hierarchy: 
 Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets at the measurement date for identical assets and liabilities. We base the fair value of our Level 1 financial instruments, which are traded in active markets, using quoted market prices for identical instruments. 
 Level 2: Prices may be based upon quoted prices in active markets or inputs not quoted on active markets but are corroborated by market data. We obtain the fair value of our Level 2 financial instruments from a professional pricing service, which may use quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments, or model driven valuations using observable market data or inputs corroborated by observable market data. To validate the fair value determination provided by our primary pricing service, we perform quality controls over values received which include comparing our pricing service provider s assessment of the fair values of our investment securities against the fair values of our investment securities obtained from another independent source, reviewing the pricing movement in the context of overall market trends, and reviewing trading information from our investment managers.

 As Lessor 
 As a lessor, we lease our Dolby Cinema product solution to exhibitors. The terms of these leases are typically years. Lease components consist of fixed payments and/or variable lease payments based on contracted percentages of revenue. Generally, leases do not grant any right to the lessee to purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease term. Dolby Cinema lease arrangements have options to extend the lease term at expiration by increments ranging from to years. 
 Assets provided under an operating lease are carried at cost within property, plant, and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets, and depreciated over the useful life of the asset using the straight-line method. Fixed operating lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term to revenue. Variable lease payments received under our Dolby Cinema operating leases are computed as shares of lessees' box office revenue and recognized to revenue in the period that box office sales occur. Lease incentive payments we make to lessees are amortized as a reduction in revenue over the lease term. The components of lease income were as follows (in thousands):

Fixed operating lease income 
 If a lease is classified as a sales-type lease, the carrying amount of the asset is derecognized from property, plant, and equipment, net, and a net investment in the lease is recorded. The net investment in the lease is measured at commencement date as the sum of the lease receivable and the estimated residual value of the equipment. The unguaranteed residual value of the equipment is determined as the estimated carrying value of the asset at the end of the lease term had the asset been depreciated on a straight-line basis. The unguaranteed residual value of sales-type leases was million and million as of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Selling profit or loss arising from a sales-type lease is recorded at lease commencement and presented on a gross basis. We recognized million to revenue and million to cost of revenue associated with sales-type leases in fiscal 2023. Over the term of the lease, we recognize interest income on the net investment in the lease, and variable lease payments, which are not included in the net investment in the lease. The variable lease payments are not material.

 Class A shares and Class B shares. As of September 29, 2023, we had shares of Class A common stock and shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding. Holders of our Class A and Class B common stock have identical rights, except that holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of our Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share. Shares of Class B common stock can be converted to shares of Class A common stock at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale or transfer, except for certain transfers specified in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. 
 Stock Incentive Plans 
 Our 2020 Stock Plan originally was adopted by our Board of Directors and shareholders in 2005 (when the 2020 Stock Plan was called the 2005 Stock Plan). Our stockholders last approved amendments to the 2020 Stock Plan at our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders. Our 2020 Stock Plan, as amended and restated, provides for the ability to grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock units, performance units, performance bonus awards, and performance shares. A total of million shares of our Class A common stock have been authorized for issuance under the 2020 Stock Plan since inception of the plan. Any shares subject to an award with a per share price less than the fair market value of our Class A common stock on the date of grant and any shares subject to an outstanding RSU award will be counted against the authorized share reserve as shares for every one share subject to the award, and if returned to the 2020 Stock Plan, such shares will be counted as shares for every one share returned. 
 Stock Options. Stock options are granted at fair market value on the date of grant. Options generally vest over , with of the options becoming exercisable on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant and the balance of the shares vesting in equal monthly installments over the following months. These options expire on the earlier of ten years after the date of grant or three months after termination of service. All options granted vest over the requisite service period and upon the exercise of stock options, we issue new shares of Class A common stock under the 2020 Stock Plan. Our 2020 Stock Plan also allows us to grant stock awards which vest based on the satisfaction of specific performance criteria. 
 Performance-Based Stock Options. From fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2019, we granted PSOs to certain officers with shares of our Class A common stock underlying such options. The contractual term for the PSOs was seven years, with vesting contingent upon market-based performance conditions, representing the achievement of specified

to of the shares subject to a PSO vested based on achievement of the performance conditions at the end of the performance period. 
 In valuing the PSOs, which will be recognized as compensation cost, we used a Monte Carlo valuation model. Aside from the use of an expected term for the PSOs commensurate with their shorter contractual term, the nature of the valuation inputs used in the Monte Carlo valuation model were consistent with those used to value our non-performance based options granted under the 2020 Stock Plan. Compensation cost is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.

 Restricted Stock Units. In fiscal 2008, we began granting RSUs to certain directors, officers and employees. RSU awards granted to employees and officers generally vest over , with cliff-vesting. Awards granted to ongoing non-employee directors generally vest over approximately . Awards granted to new non-employee directors from fiscal 2014 onward vest on the earlier of the first anniversary of the award s date of grant, or the day immediately preceding the date of the next annual meeting of stockholders that occurs after the award s date of grant. At each vesting date, the holder of the award is issued shares of our Class A common stock. Compensation expense from these awards is equal to the adjusted fair market value of our Class A common stock on the date of grant, discounted to account for dividend payments forgone during the vesting period, and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Certain grants may have other vesting conditions or other award terms as approved by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Our 2020 Stock Plan also allows us to grant RSUs that vest based on the satisfaction of specific performance criteria. 
 Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units. In fiscal 2020, we began granting PSUs to certain officers with shares of our Class A common stock underlying such awards. The terms of the PSU Agreement adopted in the first quarter fiscal 2020 provide for the grant of PSUs to certain officers contingent on Dolby's achievement of annualized TSR targets measured against a comparator index over a three-year performance period following the date of grant. Anywhere from to of eligible restricted stock units may vest based on achievement of the performance conditions at the end of the three-year performance period. The value of the PSUs, which is recognized as compensation cost, is calculated using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.

 Employee Stock Purchase Plan . Our ESPP originally was adopted by our Board of Directors and shareholders in 2005. Our stockholders last approved amendments to the ESPP at our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders. The ESPP allows eligible employees to have up to percent of their eligible compensation withheld and used to purchase Class A common stock, subject to a maximum of worth of stock purchased in a calendar year or no more than shares in an offering period, whichever is less. An offering period consists of successive purchase periods, with a look back feature to our stock price at the commencement of a offering period. The plan provides for a discount equal to percent of the lower of the closing price of our Class A common stock on the NYSE on the first day of the offering period and the last day of the purchase period. The plan also includes an automatic reset feature that provides for an offering period to be reset and recommenced to a new lower-priced offering if the offering price of a new offering period is less than that of the immediately preceding offering period. A total of million shares of our Class A common stock have been authorized for issuance under the ESPP since inception of the plan. 
 Stock Option Valuation Assumptions 
 We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of employee stock options at the date of the grant. The Black-Scholes model includes inputs that require us to make certain estimates and assumptions regarding the expected term of the award, as well as the future risk-free interest rate, and the volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the award. 
 Expected Term. The expected term of an award represents the estimated period of time that options granted will remain outstanding, and is measured from the grant date to the date at which the option is either exercised or canceled. Our determination of the expected term involves an evaluation of historical terms and other factors such as the exercise and termination patterns of our employees who hold options to acquire our Class A common stock, and is based on certain assumptions made regarding the future exercise and termination behavior. 
 Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield curve of U.S. Treasury instruments in effect on the date of grant. In determining an estimate for the risk-free interest rate, we use average interest rates based on these instruments constant maturities with a term that approximates and corresponds with the expected term of our awards.

 Stock-Based Compensation Expense 
 Stock-based compensation expense for equity awards granted to employees is determined by estimating their fair value on the date of grant, and recognizing that value as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period in which our employees earn the awards. Compensation expense related to these equity awards is recognized net of estimated forfeitures, which reduce the expense recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. The selection of applicable estimated forfeiture rates is based on an evaluation of trends in our historical forfeiture data with consideration for other potential driving factors. If in subsequent periods actual forfeitures significantly differ from our initial estimates, we will revise such estimates accordingly. The estimated annual forfeiture rates used for awards granted were , , and in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

 Common Stock Repurchase Program 
 In November 2009, we announced a stock repurchase program, providing for the repurchase of our Class A common stock. Fiscal 2010: July 2010 Fiscal 2011: July 2011 Fiscal 2012: February 2012 Fiscal 2015: October 2014 Fiscal 2017: January 2017 Fiscal 2018: July 2018 Fiscal 2019: July 2019 Fiscal 2021: July 2021 Fiscal 2022: February 2022 Fiscal 2022: August 2022 Total 
 Stock repurchases under the program may be made through open market transactions, negotiated purchases, or otherwise, at times and in amounts that we consider appropriate. The timing of repurchases and the number of shares repurchased depend upon a variety of factors, including price, regulatory requirements, the rate of dilution from our equity compensation plans, and other market conditions. The program does not have a specified expiration date, and can be limited, suspended, or terminated at our discretion at any time without prior notice. Shares repurchased under the program will be returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Class A common stock. As of September 29, 2023, the remaining authorization to purchase additional shares was million.

 Our effective tax rate was in fiscal 2023, compared with our federal statutory rate of , and with our effective tax rate in fiscal 2022 of . The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to lower tax benefits related to settlement of stock-based awards and reduced benefit from less research and development tax credits. 
 Our effective tax rate was 14.6 in fiscal 2022, compared with our effective tax rate in fiscal 2021 of 10.3 . The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a shift in the mix of earnings to jurisdictions with higher tax rates and lower tax benefits related to settlement of stock-based awards partially offset by benefit from additional research and development tax credits.

 We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing income tax controversies and the impact, if any, of the expected tolling of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions. We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal, states, and foreign jurisdictions. Our major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal, California, New York, and Ireland. 
 Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for fiscal 2015 to 2022, some of which are currently under audit or review. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If resolution of any tax issues addressed in our current audits are inconsistent with management s expectations, we may be required to adjust our tax provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. 
 The final U.S. foreign tax credit regulations, issued January 4, 2022, introduced significant changes to foreign tax credit utilization. However, a one year relief delayed the effective date of the final U.S. foreign tax credit regulations until our fiscal 2024. These provisions are expected to have a material adverse effect on our fiscal 2024 and future tax provisions unless postponed or modified.

Cash payment of the severance and other termination benefits is expected to be completed by the second half of fiscal 2024. 
 In June 2023, we implemented a focused restructuring plan, primarily consisting of workforce reductions and facility consolidations to improve execution in alignment with our strategy and to reduce our cost structure through improved utilization of our global infrastructure. As a result of these events, we recorded expense of million in severance and other related benefits offered to approximately 130 impacted employees, and we recorded expense of million related to a facility consolidation in New York, NY.

The term of this agreement is years, over which we will make payments on a semi-annual basis until fiscal 2032. Our ongoing annual payment obligations are conditioned in part on the Academy Awards being held and broadcast from the Dolby Theatre. Our payment obligations may be suspended or reduced in certain circumstances, including the protracted closure of the Dolby Theatre. We also hold the naming rights to Dolby Live at the Park MGM in Las Vegas, Nevada. Dolby Live is a fully integrated performance venue offering live concerts in Dolby Atmos. 
 Purchase Obligations. Purchase obligations primarily consist of our commitments made under agreements to purchase goods and services related to Dolby Cinema and for purposes that include information technology and telecommunications, marketing and professional services, and other R D activities. Also included in purchase obligations are non-cancelable commitments to contract manufacturers, including potentially variable obligations related to inventory based on demand forecasts we provide to the contract manufacturers. 
 Donation Commitments. Our donation commitments relate to non-cancelable obligations that consist of maintenance services and installation of imaging and audio products in exchange for various marketing, branding, and publicity benefits. These donation agreements either transfer title of our audio and imaging products to the donee or offer use of the products free of charge for a specified period of time via a leasing arrangement. The recipients of these donations participate in or promote the cinema and entertainment industry and our commitments vary in length, lasting up to years.

 The noncontrolling interest in Via LA includes million of cash held in escrow that will be fully remitted to Dolby in exchange for Via LA common equity units after 18 months from the transaction close date. The fair value of the noncontrolling interest was determined through the issuance of equity in lieu of cash. The assumed settlement of pre-existing relationships was determined based on the contractual amounts of payables and receivables between the parties as such amounts approximate fair value. 
 We have accounted for the taxable transaction under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, and the results of operations of MPEG LA have been included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition and were not material. Additionally, we have estimated the fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, with any amounts paid in excess of the net assets recorded as goodwill. The fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management s estimates and assumptions and may be subject to change as additional information is received and certain tax returns are finalized, including potential changes to income tax-related accounts. We expect to finalize the valuation within the one year measurement period.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES 
 None. 

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain "disclosure controls and procedures," as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as amended, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
 Subject to the limitations noted above, our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to meet the objective for which they were designed and operate at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Our management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2023 using the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Based on this assessment and those criteria, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 29, 2023. The Company acquired MPEG LA during fiscal 2023. Management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2023, MPEG LA's internal control over financial reporting which represented 12 of total assets and less than 1.5 of total revenue included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended September 29, 2023. 
 Our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Other than the impact of the acquisition of MPEG LA, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 29, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
