 Summary of Risk Factors The following list summarizes what we believe to be the principal risks relevant to our company. The following summary is further elaborated on by the full text of the risk factors provided in the Risk Factors section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2023. All capitalized terms in this section not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them elsewhere in this Annual Report. Material risks that may affect our business, operating results and financial condition include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: Risks Related to Our Business and Financial Position We have incurred losses since our inception and may incur continued losses in the future. We may never achieve or maintain profitability, and we may require additional capital to fund our operations. Our failure to comply with the covenants or other terms of the loan and security agreement with Avenue Capital and our secured revolving loans with Eclipse could result in a default under those agreements that could materially and adversely affect the ongoing viability of our business. Our credit facility agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business. We have indefinitely suspended development of our AR101 (enzastaurin) clinical development program and shifted our strategic focus towards accelerating the growth of our commercial business. Risks Related to Commercialization If we are unable to successfully commercialize our commercial prescription products, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected, and the price of our common stock may decline. The commercial success of our commercial prescription products will depend upon their acceptance by multiple stakeholders, including physicians, patients, and healthcare payors. If we are unable to differentiate our commercial prescription products from current and future products or existing methods of treatments or if the market opportunities for our commercial prescription products are smaller than we believe, our ability to successfully commercialize our commercial prescription products would be adversely affected and our revenue may be adversely affected. If we or our contract manufacturing organizations CMOs fail to manufacture sufficient quantities of our attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder ADHD prescription products, we may be unable to meet market demand and our ability to generate revenues could be affected. We may encounter manufacturing problems resulting in insufficient quantities being produced or not having access to the requisite supplies. If we do not secure collaborations with strategic partners to test, commercialize and manufacture product candidates, we may not be able to successfully develop products and generate meaningful revenues. If third-party payors do not reimburse pharmacies or patients for our commercial prescription products or if reimbursement levels are set too low for us to sell our commercial prescription products at a profit, our ability to successfully commercialize our commercial prescription products and our results of operations will be harmed. If we cannot implement and maintain effective patient affordability programs or improve formulary access for our commercial prescription products in the face of increasing payor pressures, the adoption of our commercial prescription products by physicians and patients may decline.

 If the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities approve generic or similar products that compete with our commercial prescription products, or if the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities change or create new pathways that may expedite approval of such products, it could decrease our expected sales of our commercial prescription products. Even though we have obtained regulatory approval for our commercial prescription products, we still face extensive FDA regulatory requirements and may face future regulatory difficulties. Our relationships with physicians, patients, payors, and pharmacies in the U.S. are subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws could expose us to criminal, civil and administrative sanctions, reputational harm, and could harm our results of operations and financial conditions. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights are inadequate to protect our technology, our commercial prescription products or our other product candidates, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology similar to ours, and our competitive position could be harmed. We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful. Third parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which could be uncertain and could harm our business. Risks Related to Our Organization, Structure and Operations Our efforts to expand and transform our business may require significant investments and may be unsuccessful. We may have difficulties integrating acquired businesses and as a result, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Product liability and other lawsuits could divert our resources, result in substantial liabilities and reduce the commercial potential of our product candidates. Risks Related to Securities Markets and Investment in Our Securities Our failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock. The price of our common stock may be volatile, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Future issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall. Some provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others. General Risk Factors Our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures or security breaches whether such failure or breach was physically affected or affected via a cybersecurity failure.

 Our sales force and other employees, third party logistics partners, CMOs, contract research organizations CROs ), principal investigators, collaborators, independent contractors, consultants and other vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements. Investing in our securities includes a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the specific factors discussed below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. This could cause the market price of our securities to decline and could cause you to lose all or part of your investment.

 AYTU BIOPHARMA, INC. PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS COMPANY OVERVIEW Aytu BioPharma, Inc. Aytu, the Company , we is a pharmaceutical company focused on commercializing novel therapeutics and consumer healthcare products. The Company operates through two business segments (i) the Rx Segment, consisting of prescription pharmaceutical products and (ii) the Consumer Health Segment, which consists of various consumer healthcare products (the Consumer Health Portfolio ). We were originally incorporated as Rosewind Corporation on August 9, 2002 in the State of Colorado and were re-incorporated as Aytu BioScience, Inc in the state of Delaware on June 8, 2015. Following the acquisition of Neos Therapeutics, Inc. Neos in March 2021 (the Neos Acquisition ), we changed our name to Aytu BioPharma, Inc. We have incurred significant losses in each year since inception. Our net loss was 17.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2023, and as of June 30, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of 304.1 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses in connection with our ongoing activities, including the integration of our acquisitions, although we do expect to become profitable following that integration and through continued growth of our commercial business. Effective January 6, 2023, we effected a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock. Unless specifically provided otherwise herein, the share and per share information that follows in this Annual Report, other than in the historical financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, assumes the effect of the reverse stock split. RECENT BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT As part of our ongoing strategic evaluation and go-forward operating plan, we are prioritizing growing our Rx Segment given the encouraging prescription trends for both our attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD Portfolio and Pediatric Portfolio, and the current market trends supporting our products growth. We believe focusing resources on our most profitable, rapidly growing products and business segments provides the most effective pathway to achieve near-term companywide profitability and continued growth. As part of our plan, we expect to monetize, divest, or otherwise discontinue the Consumer Health Segment in order to maximize profitability and, if a divestiture is made, provide us with non-dilutive capital. In fiscal year 2023, we recorded net revenue of 73.8 million in our Rx Segment, the highest revenue achieved in our history. During the year, the ADHD market encountered several supply chain interruptions, causing a shortage of medications for these patients. We were able to increase the production of our ADHD medications, Adzenys XR-ODT Adzenys ), and Cotempla XR-ODT Cotempla to provide patients with alternative solutions to products that have experienced supply chain interruptions. As a result, we recorded the highest prescription levels for both Adzenys and Cotempla in 2023. Our Pediatric Portfolio products, Poly-VI-Flor, Tri-Vi-Flor and Karbinal, also recorded record prescriptions in our fiscal 2023, which was largely attributable to sales force execution and our Aytu Rx Connect program. We currently manufacture both Adzenys and Cotempla in our facility in Grand Prairie, Texas. In an effort to reduce costs, we are in the process of transferring the manufacture of these products to a third-party manufacturer. In April 2023, we received approval from the U.S. Food Drug Administration FDA of the Adzenys Prior Approval Supplement PAS ), which enables the transfer of manufacturing of Adzenys to a third-party manufacturer. In June 2023, we submitted the Cotempla PAS to the FDA. We expect to have a six-month review process for the Cotempla PAS.

 AR101 (enzastaurin) is a development-stage asset we had been developing as an investigational treatment for Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome VEDS ), a rare connective tissue disorder for which there are no approved treatments. AR101 has received Orphan Drug Designation from both the FDA and from the European Commission, thus making AR101 eligible for market exclusivity upon product approval. AR101 also received Fast Track Designation from the FDA given the urgent, unmet need in VEDS. We do not expect the development of AR101 to advance until we are able to either fund development through operating cash flows, or through an out-license or sale to a strategic partner as we focus our resources to commercial operations. In April 2020, we entered into a licensing agreement with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Cedars-Sinai to secure worldwide rights to various potential esophageal and nasopharyngeal uses of Healight, an investigational ultraviolet light-based medical device platform being investigated as a prospective treatment for severe respiratory infections. The licensing agreement with Cedars-Sinai grants us a license to all patent and development related technology rights for the intra-corporeal therapeutic use of ultraviolet light in the field of endotracheal and nasopharyngeal applications. We terminated the Healight license on May 9, 2023 and are in the process of returning materials and transferring all intellectual property to Cedars-Sinai as we shift our resources to commercial purposes. In October 2018, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement NeuRx License with NeuRx Pharmaceuticals LLC NeuRx ), pursuant to which NeuRx granted Neos an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to research, develop, manufacture, and commercialize certain pharmaceutical products containing NeuRx s proprietary compound designated as NRX 101, subsequently referred to as NT0502. NT0502 is a new chemical entity that was being developed for the treatment of sialorrhea, which is excessive salivation or drooling. In April 2023, and in order to focus our resources on commercial operations, we returned the NT0502 rights to NeuRx in exchange for royalties and milestone payments on monies received by NeuRx from future licensing agreements, asset sales or revenue generated on NT0502. Debt and Equity Financings Avenue Capital Agreement On January 26, 2022, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the Avenue Capital Agreement with Avenue Venture Opportunities Fund II, L.P. and Avenue Venture Opportunities Fund II, L.P. (the Avenue Capital Lenders ), collectively Avenue Capital ), pursuant to which the Avenue Capital Lenders provided the Company and certain of its subsidiaries with a secured 15.0 million loan. The interest rate on the loan is the greater of the prime rate and 3.25 , plus 7.4 , payable monthly in arrears. The maturity date of the loan is January 26, 2025. The proceeds from the Avenue Capital Agreement were used towards the repayment of existing debt, which was assumed through the acquisition of Neos Therapeutics. On June 13, 2023, in conjunction with the equity financing described below, we announced that the interest-only period of the Avenue Capital Agreement was extended further upon the achievement of both the revenue-based milestone and equity raise-based milestone stipulated in the Avenue Capital Agreement. The interest-only period now extends to the January 26, 2025 maturity date. Eclipse Loan Agreement In connection with the Avenue Capital Agreement, we entered into a Consent, Waiver and Second Amendment to Eclipse Loan Agreement with Eclipse Business Capital LLC (f/k/a Encina Business Credit, LLC) Eclipse ), dated as of January 26, 2022 (the Eclipse Loan Agreement ). Pursuant to the Eclipse Loan Agreement, we, among other things, extended the maturity date of the Eclipse Loan Agreement to January 26, 2025 and reduced the maximum availability under the Eclipse Loan Agreement from 25.0 million to 12.5 million minus a 3.5 million availability block. On March 24, 2023, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into Amendment No. 4 (the Eclipse Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement dated October 2, 2019. The Eclipse Amendment, among other things, increased the maximum amount available under the revolving credit facility provided under the Eclipse Loan

 Agreement to 14.5 million. The ability to make borrowings and obtain advances of revolving loans under the Eclipse Loan Agreement remains subject to a borrowing base and reserve, and availability blockage requirements. Equity Financings In August 2022, we raised gross proceeds of 10.0 million from the issuance of (i) 1,075,290 shares of our common stock, and in lieu of common stock to certain investors that so chose, pre-funded warrants to purchase 87,500 shares of its common stock (the Pre-Funded Warrants ), and (ii) accompanying warrants (the Common Warrants to purchase 1,265,547 shares, as adjusted, of our common stock. We received 9.1 million in proceeds net of underwriting fees and other expenses. In August 2022, the Pre-Funded Warrants were exercised in full. In June 2023, we raised gross proceeds of 4.0 million from the issuance of (i) 1,743,695 shares of our common stock, and (ii) in lieu of common stock to certain investors that so chose, pre-funded warrants to purchase 430,217 shares of common stock and (iii), accompanying Tranche A warrants to purchase 2,173,912 shares of common stock, (iv) and accompanying Tranche B warrants to purchase 2,173,912 shares of common stock. We received approximately 3.4 million in proceeds net of underwriting fees and other expenses. COMMERCIAL BUSINESS OVERVIEW We operate through two business segments (i) the Rx Segment, consisting of various prescription pharmaceutical products sold through third parties, and (ii) the Consumer Health Segment, which consists of various consumer health products sold directly to consumers. We generate revenue by selling our products through third party intermediaries in our marketing channels as well as directly to our customers. We currently manufacture our ADHD products at our facility in Grand Prairie, Texas, and use third party manufacturers for our other prescription and consumer health products. Rx Segment Our Rx Segment consists of our ADHD Portfolio and our Pediatric Portfolio. Our prescription products are sold solely in the United States and are distributed through multiple channels, including sales to pharmaceutical wholesalers and pharmacies, using third-party logistics enterprises. We acquired our ADHD Portfolio in March 2021 with the acquisition of Neos Therapeutics. These commercial ADHD products are extended-release XR medications formulated in patient-friendly, orally disintegrating tablets ODT that utilize the Neos-developed microparticle modified-release drug delivery technology platform. Products containing amphetamine or methylphenidate are the most commonly prescribed medications in the United States for the treatment of ADHD. Adzenys (for patients six years of age and above) and Cotempla (for patients six to seventeen years of age) are the first and only FDA-approved amphetamine and methylphenidate extended-release, orally disintegrating tablets, respectively, for the treatment of ADHD. Our prescription Pediatric Portfolio includes Karbinal ER, an extended-release carbinoxamine (antihistamine) suspension indicated to treat numerous allergic conditions for patients two years and above and Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor , two complementary prescription fluoride-based multi-vitamin product lines containing combinations of fluoride and vitamins in liquid and chewable tablet form for infants and children with fluoride deficiency (Karbinal ER, Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor are collectively the Pediatric Portfolio ). These products serve established pediatric markets and offer distinct clinical features and patient benefits. We commercialize our Rx Portfolio through our internal commercial organization that includes approximately forty sales territories for our ADHD Portfolio and approximately six sales territories for our Pediatric Portfolio. Our Aytu RxConnect patient support program operates through a network of approximately 1,000 pharmacies to offer affordable, predictable copays and hassle-free availability to all commercially insured patients, regardless of their individual insurance plan. In addition, RxConnect seeks to significantly reduce the challenges and

 frustrations that health care professionals and their office staff can face when prescribing branded medications, including our medications, for their patients. In July 2023, we entered into an exclusive collaboration, distribution and supply agreement with Medomie Pharma Ltd, Medomie a privately owned pharmaceutical company, for Medomie to sell Adzenys and Cotempla in Israel and the Palestinian Authority. We will supply Adzenys and Cotempla to Medomie and Medomie will seek local regulatory approvals and marketing authorizations for each. This agreement represents Aytu s first international commercial agreement for Adzenys and Cotempla. Consumer Health Segment Our Consumer Health Segment is dedicated to commercializing safe and effective over-the-counter OTC medicines, personal care products, and dietary supplements to improve health and vitality. Our core products compete in categories such as hair loss, digestive health, urological health, diabetes management, and allergy. All products are intended to be used by consumers on a regular basis, and as such, we offer a monthly subscription program to allow for ongoing use and to simplify product ordering and use by patients. We acquired our Consumer Health Segment, previously known as Innovus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in February 2020 (the Innovus Acquisition ). The Consumer Health Segment currently sells directly to consumers primarily in the United States through e-commerce platforms, including branded websites and Amazon.com which utilize marketing strategies focused on search engine optimization, search marketing and affiliate marketing. Additionally, the segment sells products through direct mail solicitations and advertisements, allowing consumers to purchase directly through business reply mail, through call centers, or online with shipment directly to their homes. We expect to monetize, divest, or otherwise discontinue the Consumer Health Segment in order to maximize profitability and, if a divestiture is made, provide us with non-dilutive capital. Development Portfolio AR101 On April 12, 2021, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Rumpus VEDS, LLC, Rumpus Therapeutics, LLC, and Rumpus Vascular, LLC (together Rumpus pursuant to which we acquired commercial global licenses, relating primarily to the pediatric-onset rare disease development asset enzastaurin, or AR101. AR101 is initially being studied for the treatment of VEDS. AR101 is an orally available investigational first-in-class small molecule, serine/threonine kinase inhibitor of the PKC beta, PI3K and AKT pathways. AR101 has been studied in more than 3,300 patients across a range of solid and hematological tumor types in trials previously conducted by Eli Lilly Company. Harry Hal C. Dietz III, M.D. developed the first preclinical model that mimics the human condition and recapitulates VEDS, and this model serves as the basis for the plausible clinical benefit and rationale for conducting a clinical trial with AR101 in VEDS. This novel knock-in mouse model has the same genetic mutation most prevalent in VEDS patients and is representative of the human condition in both the timing and location of VEDS-related vascular events. The model has generated identical structural histology and mechanical characteristics, and unbiased findings demonstrated that vascular structure alone does not lead to vascular events. Objective comparative transcriptional profiling by high-throughput RNA sequencing of the aorta displayed a molecular signature for excessive PKC/ERK cell signaling that is the purported driver of disease. PKC inhibitors proved efficacious in multiple pre-clinical and murine (mice) models and indeed prevented death due to vascular rupture. We have secured exclusive global rights to AR101 in the fields of rare genetic pediatric onset or congenital disorders outside of oncology. AR101 is protected by a suite of pending patents being pursued in major markets globally which have been licensed from The Johns Hopkins University Johns Hopkins and have an earliest priority date of March 2017. In December 2021, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation ODD to AR101 for the treatment of EDS, inclusive of VEDS, allowing for seven years of marketing exclusivity in the United States. The FDA has cleared the IND application for AR101, although, we do not expect to advance development of AR101 until we are able to either fund development through operating cash flows or through an out-license or sale to a strategic partner.

 OUR STRATEGY Our goal is to become a leading pharmaceutical company that improves the lives of patients and healthcare consumers. We will do this by employing a focused approach of in-licensing, acquiring, developing, and commercializing novel prescription therapeutics and consumer health products. Our primary focus is on commercializing innovative prescription products that address conditions frequently developed or diagnosed in childhood, including ADHD. We also commercialize consumer healthcare products through efficient e-commerce and direct-to-patient platforms, although we expect to monetize, divest, or discontinue the Consumer Health Segment in favor of focusing on the Rx Segment and attaining profitability. Our strategic priorities are to continue to increase revenues from our Rx Segment and enhance our financial performance through operational and manufacturing efficiencies and portfolio prioritization. Specifically, we intend to: continue to grow our commercial branded, revenue-generating products, by increasing product sales and improving patient access. Our primary commercial objective is to drive revenue growth of our ADHD and pediatric brands, which consists of Adzenys, Cotempla, Poly-Vi-Flor, Tri-Vi-Flor, and Karbinal ER. We expect to increase market share using our internal commercial organization and leveraging our advanced analytics platform to optimize sales force performance and increase both the breadth, or number of healthcare professionals HCPs prescribing our medicines, and the depth, or the number of appropriate patients per HCP for our products; leverage our novel Aytu RxConnect patient support platform, which is designed to reduce access barriers to medicines facing patients and HCPs by providing coverage for all commercially insured patients, regardless of their individual insurance plan, thus establishing an affordable and predictable monthly co-pay for patients, and eliminating many of the hassles facing HCPs and their staffs by improving availability of Aytu products at participating pharmacies; improve gross margins for our ADHD product franchise through the manufacturing transfer of Adzenys and Cotempla to a contract manufacturing organization, a transition that is expected to occur in early calendar 2024; 
 We believe our history of acquiring companies and in-licensing and acquiring products and pipeline assets, along with our success in building out commercial organizations and executing product launch and growth strategies, is a distinct competitive advantage. Our transactional adeptness and execution orientation enable us to continue to seek growth opportunities through both organic growth and opportunistic in-licensing or strategic acquisitions. Further, our commercial infrastructure and distribution capability is scalable and lends itself to additional on-market assets and future product candidates that fit within our core therapeutic focus or within our commercial capabilities and infrastructure. As such, in the near term, we may seek to leverage our commercial model and infrastructure by expanding our commercial portfolio with external product opportunities as we have done since our inception. OUR PRODUCTS AND MARKETS Prescription Products ADHD Portfolio ADHD Market and Treatment Options ADHD is a neurobehavioral disorder characterized by a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity that interferes with functioning and/or development. ADHD can have a profound impact on an individual s life, causing disruption at school, work, home and in relationships. It is one of the most common developmental disorders in children and often persists into adulthood. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC reported that six million children in the United States ages 3 to 17 had previously received an ADHD diagnosis

 between 2016-2019, up 36 since 2003. Current ADHD treatment guidelines recommend a multi-faceted approach that uses medications in conjunction with behavioral interventions. In 2022, approximately 83.5 million prescriptions for medications with ADHD labeling were written in the United States generating 21.2 billion in sales. Approximately 91 of these prescriptions were for stimulant medications, such as amphetamine and methylphenidate, which are and have remained the standard of care for several decades. The market for ADHD medications outside of the United States is less developed, but we believe it will continue to grow as recognition and awareness of the disorder increase. Extended-release, or long-acting, dosage forms of stimulant medications are the standard of care for treating ADHD, making up approximately 43 of ADHD prescriptions. The most prescribed extended-release medications for ADHD, Adderall XR and Concerta (and each of their generic equivalents), are long-acting versions of previously short-acting amphetamine and methylphenidate medications, respectively. Most of these extended-release dosage forms allow for once-daily dosing in the morning, which eliminates the need to re-dose during the day. Our products, Adzenys XR-ODT and Cotempla XR-ODT, are extended-release orally disintegrating tablets that allow for once-daily dosing based upon our internally developed proprietary microparticle delivery technology and are the only approved extended-release orally disintegrating tablet formulations of amphetamine and methylphenidate for the treatment of ADHD. There is significant competition in the ADHD market, including from well-established companies, many of whom have substantially greater financial, technical and commercial resources than we do, and entrenched existing ADHD products. For example: Extended-release amphetamine products are currently marketed in the United States by (i) Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited under the brand names Adderall XR , Vyvanse and Mydayis and (ii) Tris Pharma, Inc. Tris ), under the brand names Dyanavel XR, Dyanavel XR tablets; Extended-release methylphenidate products are marketed in the United States by (i) Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. under the brand name Concerta , (ii) Tris under the brand names Quillivant XR and QuilliChew ER , (iii) Rhodes Pharmaceuticals LP under the brand name Aptensio XR , (iv) Ironshore Pharmaceuticals Inc. under the brand name Jornay PM , (v) Alora Pharmaceuticals under the name Methylphenidate HCl ER 72 mg Tablets, (vi) Novartis under the brand names Focalin XR and Ritalin LA and (vii) Azstarys , a product developed by KemPharm (now Zevra Therapeutics) and sold by Corium; and a non-stimulant treatment for ADHD was approved by the FDA and commercially launched by Supernus in the U.S in 2021 is being sold under the brand name Qelbree . 
 Further, makers of branded drugs could also enhance their own formulations in a manner that competes with our enhancements of these drugs. We are also aware of efforts by several pharmaceutical companies with ADHD medications in clinical development, including Cingulate Therapeutics, NLS Pharma and Neurovance, a subsidiary of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Our ADHD Product Portfolio Our modified-release drug delivery technology platform has enabled us to create extended-release ODT formulations of amphetamine and methylphenidate. This was achieved by developing an extended-release profile that allows for once daily dosing and an ODT formulation that allows for easier administration and ingestion and twelve-hour duration of action. Adzenys XR-ODT and Cotempla XR-ODT are the first and only XR-ODT products for the treatment of ADHD. These XR-ODT products offer unique attributes to ADHD patients and caregivers, including: ease of administration and ingestion because they disintegrate rapidly in the mouth and may be taken without water;

 taste-masking of bitter ADHD medications, with pleasant-tasting flavor; prevention of cheeking, the practice of hiding medication in the mouth and later spitting it out rather than swallowing it; and 
 Adzenys XR-ODT: Amphetamine XR-ODT for the treatment of ADHD Adzenys XR-ODT is approved by the FDA for the treatment of ADHD in patients six years and older and is the first FDA-approved amphetamine XR-ODT for the treatment of ADHD. The New Drug Application NDA for Adzenys XR-ODT relies on the efficacy and safety data that formed the basis of FDA approval for the reference listed drug, Adderall XR, 30 mg, together with bioequivalence, bioavailability, and aggregate safety data from the Adzenys XR-ODT clinical program. Adzenys XR-ODT contains amphetamine loaded onto a mixture of immediate-release and polymer-coated delayed-release resin particles, which are formulated and compressed into an ODT along with other tableting excipients using our patented Rapidly Disintegrating Ionic Masking RDIM technology. The result is amphetamine with an in vivo extended-release profile delivered through a tablet that quickly disintegrates in the mouth without the need for water. Adzenys XR-ODT is available in 30-day supply, child-resistant blister packs. The suite of composition-of-matter patents for Adzenys XR-ODT are scheduled to expire in 2026 and 2032. These patents are listed in the FDA s publication of approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations (the Orange Book ). In addition, we entered into a settlement agreement with Actavis Laboratories FL, Inc. Actavis (acquired by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries), which resolved all ongoing litigation involving Adzenys XR-ODT patents and Actavis ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of Adzenys XR-ODT. Under the agreement with Actavis, Actavis has the right to manufacture and market its approved generic version of Adzenys XR-ODT under the ANDA beginning on September 1, 2025, or earlier under certain circumstances. In conjunction with the approval of the Adzenys XR-ODT NDA, the FDA has required us to conduct certain clinical studies in preschool (age four to five years) children with ADHD as a post-marketing requirement. A pharmacokinetic study in this population was completed in 2018, and we are in discussions with the FDA to further clarify the design protocols required to conduct the remaining studies. Cotempla XR-ODT: Methylphenidate XR-ODT for the treatment of ADHD The FDA approved Cotempla XR-ODT for the treatment of ADHD in patients six to seventeen years old. The Cotempla XR-ODT NDA relies on the efficacy and safety data that formed the basis of FDA approval for the reference listed drug, Metadate CD , together with bioavailability/bioequivalence data and efficacy/safety data from the Cotempla XR-ODT clinical program. The results of the Cotempla XR-ODT Phase 3 clinical efficacy and safety trial showed a statistically significant improvement in ADHD symptom control compared to placebo across the school day. Onset of effect was observed within one hour post-dose and persisted through 12 hours. No serious adverse events were reported during the study, and the adverse event profile was consistent with the drug s mechanism of action. Cotempla XR-ODT contains methylphenidate loaded onto a mixture of immediate-release and polymer-coated delayed-release resin particles, which are formulated and compressed into an ODT along with other tableting excipients using our RDIM technology. The result is methylphenidate with an in vivo extended-release profile delivered through a tablet that quickly disintegrates in the mouth. Cotempla XR-ODT is available in 30-day supply, child-resistant blister packs. Cotempla XR-ODT is the first FDA-approved methylphenidate XR-ODT for the treatment of ADHD. We hold composition-of-matter patents in the U.S. which we expect will provide Cotempla XR-ODT intellectual property protection until 2032, and a method-of-use patent was issued which will extend protection until 2038. These patents are listed in the Orange Book. In addition, Neos entered into a settlement agreement with Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. Teva ), which resolved all ongoing litigation involving the Cotempla XR-ODT patents and Teva s ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of Cotempla XR-ODT. Under the agreement with Teva, Neos granted Teva the right to manufacture and market its approved generic version of Cotempla XR-ODT under the ANDA beginning on July 1, 2026, or earlier under certain circumstances.

 In conjunction with the approval of the Cotempla XR-ODT NDA, the FDA required us to perform additional clinical studies in preschool (age four to five years) children with ADHD as a post-marketing requirement. A pharmacokinetic study in this population was completed in 2019. In light of a new draft guidance for industry that was published in May 2019, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: Developing Stimulant Drugs for Treatment Guidance for Industry, we remain in discussions with the FDA to gain concurrence on the design of the protocols required to meet the remaining post-marketing requirements. Pediatric Portfolio Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor: Our fluoride-based multivitamin prescription supplement product line for infants and children Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor are two complementary prescription fluoride-based supplement product lines containing combinations of vitamins and sodium fluoride in various oral formulations. These prescription supplements are prescribed for infants and children to treat or prevent fluoride deficiency due to poor diet or low levels of fluoride in drinking water and other sources while also providing multi-vitamin support and folic acid supplementation. Because these products contain at least .25 mg of sodium fluoride, Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor are classified as products that should be administered under the supervision of a licensed prescriber. Fluoride supplementation has been proven to protect teeth from decay. Community water fluoridation prevents tooth decay by providing frequent and consistent contact with low levels of fluoride. By keeping the teeth strong and solid, fluoride stops cavities from forming and can rebuild the tooth s surface. Community water fluoridation began in the United States in 1945 and is the process of adjusting the amount of fluoride in drinking water to a level recommended for preventing tooth decay. As of 2016, more than 200 million people, or nearly 3 in 4 Americans who use public water supplies, drank water with enough fluoride to prevent tooth decay. However, Americans living in municipalities that do not fluoridate the water supply or in rural areas that rely on well water supplies do not receive recommended levels of fluoride through fluoridation. Therefore, many children living in these areas often require daily fluoride supplementation as part of their mineral and vitamin intake. In many instances, physicians prescribe fluoride-based multi-vitamins (Vitamins A, B, C, D and folic acid) regularly to supplement their fluoride intake and enable convenient supplementation. Infants are prescribed easier-to-take multi-vitamin drops while older children are prescribed tablet formulations. In 2022, 8 million multi-vitamin prescriptions were written in the U.S. Of those prescriptions, multi-vitamins containing sodium fluoride accounted for 1.1 million total prescriptions. Common multi-vitamin combinations contain vitamins A, B, C, D and E, but no other prescription pediatric multi-vitamin products contain Metafolin, which makes the Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor product lines distinct, single-source brands. Other brands include Tri-Vite (marketed by Method Pharmaceuticals), Floriva (marketed by BonGeo Pharmaceuticals) and Quflora (marketed by Carwin Pharmaceutical Associates). Poly-Vi-Flor is available in both chewable tablet and oral liquid suspension multivitamin formulations in six different product presentations: Poly-Vi-Flor Chewable Tablets .25 mg, .50 mg, and 1 mg tablets, Poly-Vi-Flor Chewable Tablets with Iron, Poly-Vi-Flor Oral Suspension and Poly-Vi-Flor Oral Suspension with Iron. Poly-Vi-Flor contains Vitamin A, Vitamins B1, B2, B3, and B6, Vitamin C, Sodium Fluoride in various doses and Metafolin, a proprietary, trademarked L-methylfolate form of folic acid developed by and licensed from Merck Cie Merck ). Beginning in the second half of fiscal 2023, we introduced Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor containing Arcofolin, Arcofolin offers an improved profile over Metafolin as a body ready L-methylfolate. Arcofolin s low water content and low molecular weight of the counterion yield higher levels of assayed folate than other forms of L-methylfolate currently available on the market. It also has an improved purity profile, enhanced water solubility and an excellent overall stability profile. The addition of Arcofolin also broadens the brands IP protection and extends the patent life and provides further differentiation with this novel ingredient. Tri-Vi-Flor is available as an oral liquid suspension in two different strengths (.25 mg and .50 mg fluoride) containing Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin D3, Sodium Fluoride, Sodium Benzoate and L-methylfolate. By virtue of its

Table of Contents 
 L-methylfolate content, Tri-Vi-Flor offers a similar clinical profile: a fluoride-based multivitamin containing a proprietary, body-ready L-methylfolate. Arcofolin , which we also licensed exclusively in our field of use, is Merck s manufactured calcium salt of L-5-methyltetrahydrofolic or L-methylfolate. It is a body ready alternative to folic acid and offers good stability, solubility, and bioavailability. Folic acid supplementation is recommended in various patient groups, but a significant number of patients have difficulty metabolizing folate due to an enzymatic deficiency caused by a genetic mutation affecting the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, or MTHFR. MTHFR converts ingested folate (such as supplemented folic acid) into L-methylfolate, the body s usable form. Clinical studies have demonstrated that 75 of patients may have at least one MTHFR genetic mutation while 40 may have two mutations. These mutations lead to impaired function of the enzyme and result in folate deficiency. Both Arcofolin and Metafolin are unaffected by the MTHFR mutation, thereby directly delivering bioavailable L-methylfolate, and offering a distinct clinical advantage over other folic acid supplements. The core family of patent covering Arcofolin has a priority date of March 31, 2017 and describes a crystalline sodium salt of 5-methyl-(6S)- tetrahydrofolic acid wherein the molar ratio of 5-methyl-(6S)-tetrahydrofolic acid to sodium is from 1:0.5 to 1:1.5 (in mol/mol) and/or hydrates and/or solvates thereof, as well as a process of obtaining the same. Upon issuance, the standard 20-year exclusivity for this patent would expire in 2037. The prescription multi-vitamin market is dominated by generic products, with brands accounting for 9.5 of the multivitamin plus fluoride market for the year ending December 31, 2022. Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor primarily compete in the generic prescription multi-vitamin fluoride market and with the branded products FLORIVA and QFLORA. Karbinal ER: Extended release carbinoxamine oral suspension for the treatment of seasonal and perennial allergies Karbinal ER (carbinoxamine maleate extended-release oral suspension) is an H1 receptor antagonist (antihistamine) indicated to treat seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis due to inhalant allergens and food, mild, uncomplicated allergic skin manifestations of urticaria and angioedema, dermatographism, as therapy for anaphylactic reactions adjunctive to epinephrine and other standard measures after the acute manifestations have been controlled, and amelioration of the severity of allergic reactions to blood or plasma for patients two years of age and above. Over 50 million Americans suffer from allergies in any given year, and allergies are the sixth leading cause of chronic illness in the U.S. Numerous allergy treatments exist to address allergies and allergic symptoms depending upon the symptom(s). Oral antihistamines are considered a mainstay of allergy treatment, and the prescription antihistamine market is a large category with approximately 52 million prescriptions written in 2021. The prescription antihistamine category is dominated by generic products and consists of first generation and second-generation molecules. Generally, first-generation antihistamines block both histaminic and muscarinic receptors and pass the blood-brain barrier. Second-generation antihistamines mainly block histaminic receptors, but they do not pass the blood-brain barrier. First generation antihistamines, which are generally characterized as more sedating, accounted for 6 of 2021 total prescriptions, while non-sedating, second generation antihistamines accounted for 94 of total prescriptions. The most widely prescribed oral, second-generation antihistamines are cetirizine (brand name Zyrtec and loratadine (brand name Claritin ). Diphenhydramine (brand name Benadryl is the most widely prescribed first-generation molecule. Karbinal ER is the only FDA-approved, 12-hour carbinoxamine oral suspension and is an effective antihistamine with a broad range of indications. Karbinal ER is positioned as a second-line allergy treatment for patients who continue to suffer from allergic symptoms following initial treatment with a second-generation, non-sedating antihistamine. Further, as Karbinal ER is an oral suspension formulation, children are the primary target patient given their preference for liquid treatments and, in many cases, their inability to swallow tablets or capsules. Karbinal ER is indicated for children as young as two years of age. Karbinal has a pleasant strawberry-banana taste and is available in 480 mL bottles.

 Through a supply and distribution agreement with Tris, we own exclusive rights to distribute Karbinal ER in the U.S. through August 2032, unless the agreement is terminated earlier pursuant to the termination provisions in the agreement. As part of the agreement, we pay sales-based royalties based on net revenue. Additionally, we are committed to make annual minimum payments to Tris through 2025. Two core patents protect Karbinal ER in the U.S., and both parents are listed in the FDA s Orange Book. The first patent describes a coated drug-ion exchange resin complex comprising a core composed of a drug complexed with a pharmaceutically acceptable ion-exchange resin. The priority date for this family is March 29, 2009, so the standard 20-year exclusivity for this patent will expire in 2029. The second patent describes an aqueous liquid suspension containing a coated drug-ion exchange resin complex comprising a core molecule complexed with a pharmaceutically acceptable ion-exchange resin and an uncoated ion exchange resin complex. The priority date for this family is June 15, 2007, so the standard 20-year exclusivity for this patent will expire in 2027. Karbinal ER faces competition from OTC products such as non-sedating antihistamines, sedating antihistamines as well as nasal steroids, nasal antihistamines, and anticholinergics. Consumer Health Segment We acquired our consumer health business through the acquisition of Innovus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in February 2020. The consumer health business is focused on OTC medicines and consumer health products designed to address common conditions. Now doing business as Aytu Consumer Health, we commercialize numerous products in the U.S. and Canada through two distinct marketing channels: e-commerce platforms including our websites and Amazon.com and via direct mail campaigns. We classify our products into three categories: ANDA/Medical Device OTC products, which compete in large consumer health categories and are marketed primarily through Amazon.com; OTC monograph products, which compete in large consumer health categories; and Dietary supplements and personal care products, which are proprietary products with strong scientific evidence and clinical support. 
 The following represents the core Aytu Consumer Health OTC medicines, which are expected to be the Consumer Health Segment s primary profit drivers: Regoxidine - for Men Women proprietary over-the-counter aerosol foam that works to treat hair loss in both men and women. OmepraCareDR - acid reducer to treat frequent heartburn. EsomepraCareDR - acid reducer to treat frequent heartburn. 
 Given the company s shift in focus and objective of generating near-term profitability, we expect to divest, monetize, or discontinue the Consumer Health operations by the end of fiscal 2024 or shortly thereafter. We own over 200 trademarks for products in our Consumer Health Portfolio and own or license patents covering 9 of these products, some of which we plan to either license, sell, or discontinue as part of the planned divestiture, sale, or discontinuation of the Consumer Health Segment.

 MANUFACTURING ADHD Product Portfolio For the production of our ADHD products, we lease a manufacturing site in Grand Prairie, Texas. This facility has 77,112 square feet of manufacturing and laboratory space and contains dedicated current Good Manufacturing Practices cGMP manufacturing suites for both Adzenys XR-ODT and Cotempla XR-ODT. We hold U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration DEA manufacturing and analytical licenses and maintain storage and use of Schedule II through IV controlled substances. The manufacture of our products is subject to extensive cGMP regulations, which impose various procedural and documentation requirements and govern all areas of record keeping, production processes and controls, personnel and quality control. We are in the process of transferring the manufacturing of our ADHD products to a contract manufacturing organization CMO ). The transfer of the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products requires several steps including knowledge and method transfer, manufacturing of materials for feasibility studies and confirmation batch materials, bioequivalence studies, inspections from regulatory agencies, and regulatory filings. We have completed the required activities, including the successful completion of bioequivalence studies, which are required in order to enable the transfer of both Adzenys XR-ODT and Cotempla XR-ODT. The Adzenys XR-ODT Prior Approval Supplement PAS was approved by the FDA in April 2023, and the Cotempla XR-ODT PAS was submitted to the FDA in June 2023. We expect to receive approval for the Cotempla XR-ODT PAS by early calendar 2024. Thus, we expect the CMO to begin manufacturing both ADHD products in early calendar 2024. In conjunction with transferring the manufacturing of our ADHD products to a CMO, we entered into an agreement with AMT Manufacturing Solutions, LLC, a newly established, full service CMO, to sublease 22,909 square feet of our Grand Prairie, Texas manufacturing facility. This sublease represents over 30 of our facility. In addition, commencing as early as April 1, 2024, but no later than December 31, 2024, the sublease will be expanded to include the remaining portion of the manufacturing facility. This agreement enables us to reduce costs associated with exiting the facility and allows for increased supply chain flexibility. Pediatric Product Portfolio We contract with CMOs for the manufacture and testing of our Pediatric Portfolio products. We have entered into the following key supply agreements for the commercial manufacture and supply of certain of these products: Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor drops are purchased through a supply agreement with a CMO based in the U.S., and we expect to add our multivitamin chewable tables to this supply agreement. Until that time, the chewable tablets are being produced and purchased without a supply agreement specifically covering those purchases. Merck Cie is responsible for providing Metafolin and Arcofolin to our designated CMO. A supply agreement with Tris Pharma for the supply of Karbinal. This agreement terminates in August 2033, subject to earlier termination or extension in accordance with the terms of the agreement. 
 We believe the third-party manufacturers of our Pediatric Portfolio products have adequate capacity to manufacture sufficient quantities of these products to meet anticipated commercial demands. As we rely on CMOs, we employ personnel with extensive technical, manufacturing, supply chain management, and analytical and quality experience to oversee contract manufacturing and testing activities, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions. Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, and which govern record-keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among other activities. Our systems and our contractors are required to comply with these regulations, and we assess this compliance regularly through monitoring of performance and a formal audit program.

 Consumer Health Segment The Consumer Health Segment maintains relationships with a number of manufacturers and brokers from which it obtains its products. We attempt to work with a variety of manufacturers to broaden our supplier base and to optimize product acquisition costs and delivery schedules. For our OTC medicines we have relationships with three primary suppliers and one broker through which we source our consumer health products. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT We have indefinitely suspended product candidate research and development activities in favor of focusing our resources on our commercialization efforts. With this re-focusing on commercial operations, development of our lead product candidate, AR101, is on indefinite hold. We are pursuing strategic partnerships in order to advance this program but have no assurance that a partnership will be consummated. Our Development Pipeline: AR101 (enzastaurin for the treatment of Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (VEDS)) AR101 (enzastaurin) is an orally available investigational first-in-class small molecule, serine/threonine kinase inhibitor of the protein kinase C PKC beta, PI3K and AKT pathways. AR101 has been studied in more than 3,300 patients across a range of solid and hematological tumor types. AR101 was originally developed by Eli Lilly and Company Lilly ), and worldwide rights were acquired by Denovo Biopharma in September 2014 following Lilly s discontinuation of the enzastaurin development program. VEDS is a rare genetic disorder typically diagnosed in childhood and characterized by arterial aneurysm, dissection and rupture, bowel rupture and rupture of the gravid uterus. VEDS is the severe subtype of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, affecting 1 in 50,000 people worldwide. VEDS results from pathogenic variants in the COL3A1 gene, which encodes the chains of type III procollagen, a major protein in vessel walls and hollow organs. Twenty-five percent of VEDS patients have a first complication by the age of 20 years, and more than 80 percent have at least one complication by the age of 40. VEDS patients have a median lifespan of 51 years. There are currently no FDA approved treatments for VEDS. The research underpinning the application of enzastaurin for the treatment of VEDS has been conducted by Dr. Harry (Hal) Dietz and his research colleagues. Dr. Dietz is the Victor A. McKusick Professor of Genetics in the departments of medicine, pediatrics, and molecular biology and genetics at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and director of the William S. Smilow Center for Marfan Syndrome Research. He has also been an investigator at Howard Hughes Medical Institute since 1997. Dr. Dietz is a leading scientist in the field of genetic connective tissue disorders and developed the first preclinical model that mimics the human condition and recapitulates VEDS. His group s research findings were published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation in February 2020. The VEDS knock-in murine (mouse) preclinical model from Dr. Dietz has the same genetic mutation most prevalent in VEDS patients and is representative of the human condition in both the timing and location of vascular events. The model has generated identical structural histology and mechanical characteristics, and unbiased findings demonstrated that structure alone does not lead to vascular events. Objective comparative transcriptional profiling by high-throughput RNA sequencing of the aorta displayed a consistent molecular signature for excessive PKC/ERK cell signaling that is now known to be the driver of disease. Based on the scientific rationale for intervention along the PKC/ERK pathway, PKC inhibition and treatment with PKC inhibitors proved efficacious in multiple pre-clinical and murine studies and indeed prevented death due to vascular rupture. In fiscal 2022 we received Orphan Drug Designation for AR101 in Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome including VEDS and in Europe, allowing for seven years marketing exclusivity in the United States and ten years in Europe. We also received Fast Track designation for AR101 in VEDS by the FDA, allowing for an accelerated review timeline upon submission of the New Drug Application NDA and more frequent interaction with the FDA during the development process. AR101 is protected by a suite of five pending patents being pursued in major markets globally which have been licensed from Johns Hopkins and have an earliest priority date of March 2017. The cornerstone of the intellectual

This pending patent provides compositions and methods for treating VEDS and associated connective tissue disorders and has a priority date of October 2018. The second pending patent provides methods and compositions for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Marfan syndrome and related diseases, disorders and conditions and has a priority date of March 2017, in select geographies. The third pending patent, titled Targeted Epigenetic Therapy for Inherited Aortic Aneurysm Conditions, broadens the coverage of the potential therapeutic application of AR101/Enzastaurin and has a priority date of September 2017. The fourth pending patent, titled Pathway Targets for the Treatment of Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome , and the fifth pending patent, titled Endothelin-1 Signaling Contributes to Vascular Rupture Risk , deepens the scientific evidence of the pathophysiology of Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and are highly confirmatory of the therapeutic approach for AR101/Enzastaurin. These pending patents have priority dates of September 2020 and February 2022 respectively. Additional molecule intellectual property is afforded through the license with Denovo whose pending patent provides methods and compositions for the prediction of the activity of enzastaurin and has a priority date of September 1, 2016. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY We seek trademark protection in the United States when appropriate. We currently own or license registered trademarks for Aytu, Aytu Biopharma, Neos Therapeutics, Innovus Pharma, Healight, Poly-Vi-Flor, Adzenys, Adzenys XR-ODT, Adzenys ER and Cotempla XR-ODT in the United States, as well as trademarks related to our DTRS technology. From time to time, we may find it necessary or prudent to obtain licenses from third party intellectual property holders. GOVERNMENT REGULATION We are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. The FDCA and the FDA s implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record-keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, sale, advertising and promotion of our products and product candidates. We may seek approval for, and market, our products in other countries in the future. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the U.S., although there can be important differences. Development and Approval Under the FDCA, FDA approval of an NDA is required before any new drug can be marketed in the U.S. NDAs in the case of new drugs, or PMAs or 510(k)s in the case of medical devices, may require extensive studies and submission of a large amount of data by the applicant, including the following: Preclinical Testing . Preclinical testing generally includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in several animal species to assess the toxicity and dosing of the product. Clinical Trials . Clinical trials involve the administration of a drug to healthy human volunteers or to patients, under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Phase 1 clinical trials involve the initial administration of the investigational drug to humans, typically to a small group of healthy human subjects, but occasionally to a group of patients with the targeted disease or disorder. Phase 1 clinical trials generally are intended to evaluate the safety, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. 
 19 

Table of Contents 
 Phase 2 clinical trials generally are controlled studies that involve a relatively small sample of the intended patient population and are designed to develop initial data regarding the product s effectiveness, to determine dose response and the optimal dose range, and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential AEs. Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted after preliminary evidence of effectiveness has been obtained and are intended to gather the additional information about safety and effectiveness necessary to evaluate the drug s overall risk-benefit profile, and to provide a basis for physician labeling. Generally, Phase 3 clinical development programs consist of expanded, multi-site, large-scale studies of patients with the target disease or disorder to obtain statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the drug at the proposed dosing regimen. Phase 3 data often form the core basis on which the FDA evaluates a drug s safety and effectiveness when considering the product application. 
 Post-Approval Regulation Once approved, drug products are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA. If ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety or manufacturing problems occur after the product reaches the market, the FDA may at any time withdraw product approval or take actions that would limit or suspend marketing. Additionally, the FDA may require post-marketing studies or clinical trials, changes to a product s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, or the implementation of other risk management measures, including distribution-related restrictions, if there are new safety information developments. DEA Regulation Our ADHD products are considered a controlled substance as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, because Adzenys XR-ODT contains amphetamine and Cotempla XR-ODT contains methylphenidate. Because amphetamine and methylphenidate are Schedule II controlled substances, the DEA has Adzenys XR-ODT and Cotempla XR-ODT listed and regulated as Schedule II controlled substances. None of our pediatric products (Poly-Vi-Flor, Tri-Vi-Flor and Karbinal ER) are considered controlled substances. Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much of a controlled substance may be produced in and/or imported into the U.S. based on the DEA s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. Our or our manufacturers quotas of an active ingredient may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. Any delay, limitation or refusal by the DEA in establishing our or our manufacturers quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Individual states also independently regulate controlled substances. We and our manufacturers will be subject to state regulation on distribution of these products, including, for example, state requirements for licensures or registration. Additionally, we use third-party logistics firms to inventory and fill sales orders for our commercial portfolio. We contract with third parties for the manufacture and testing of Karbinal, Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor. Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor are not supplied under any contract. We have entered into the following key supply agreements for the commercial manufacture and supply of certain of these products: A supply agreement with Tris for the supply of Karbinal. This agreement terminates in August 2033, subject to earlier termination or extension in accordance with the terms of the agreement.

 Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor drops are produced under a supply agreement with a CMO based in the U.S., and we expect to expand that agreement to include the chewable tablet formations. Until that time, the Ploy-Vi-Flor chewable tablets are produced by the same CMO on a purchase order-to-purchase order basis, Merck Cie is responsible for providing Metafolin and Arcofolin to our designated CMO. 
 We believe our third-party manufacturers have adequate capacity to manufacture sufficient quantities of these products to meet anticipated commercial demands. Because we rely on CMOs, we employ personnel with extensive technical, manufacturing, supply chain management, and analytical and quality experience to oversee contract manufacturing and testing activities, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions. Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, and which govern record-keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among other activities. Our systems and our contractors are required to comply with these regulations, and we assess this compliance regularly through monitoring of performance and a formal audit program. For the production of our ADHD products, we lease one manufacturing site in Grand Prairie, Texas. This facility has 77,112 square feet of manufacturing and laboratory space, and contains dedicated cGMP manufacturing suites for both Adzenys XR-ODT and Cotempla XR-ODT. We hold DEA manufacturing and analytical licenses, and maintain storage and use of Schedule II through IV controlled substances. The manufacture of our products is subject to extensive cGMP regulations, which impose various procedural and documentation requirements and govern all areas of record keeping, production processes and controls, personnel, and quality control. We are in the process of a technology transfer to outsource the manufacturing of our ADHD products to a CMO. The transfer of the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products requires several steps including knowledge and method transfer, manufacturing of materials for feasibility study and confirmation batch materials, bioequivalence studies and regulatory filings. We have completed the required activities, including the successful completion of bioequivalence studies, which are required in order to enable the transfer of both Adzenys XR-ODT and Cotempla XR-ODT. The Adzenys XR-ODT Prior Approval Supplement PAS was approved by the FDA in April 2023, and the Cotempla XR-ODT PAS was submitted to the FDA in June 2023. We expect to receive approval for the Cotempla XR-ODT PAS by early calendar 2024. We expect the CMO to begin manufacturing both ADHD products in early calendar 2024. HUMAN CAPITAL As of June 30, 2023, we employed 150 full-time employees, including 53 who are involved in operations, 5 who are directly involved in research and development, 60 who are involved in commercialization and 32 who are involved in general and administrative activities. All of our colleagues are located in the U.S. Of these colleagues, 45 are female and 55 are male. Our colleagues are not represented by a labor union. Our values team-oriented, hard-working, relentlessly determined, integrity, visionary, entrepreneurial, and servant-minded - are built on the foundation that the colleagues we hire and the way we treat one another promote creativity, innovation, and productivity, which spur our success. This culture depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain and develop a diverse population of talents and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization. Providing market competitive pay and benefit programs, opportunities to participate in the success they help create, while engaging colleagues in important dialogue regarding organization performance, we create a culture of inclusion in which all colleagues have the opportunity to thrive.

CODE OF ETHICS We have adopted a written code of ethics that applies to our officers, directors, and employees, including our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer. We intend to disclose any amendments to, or waivers from, our code of ethics that are required to be publicly disclosed pursuant to rules of the SEC by filing such amendment or waiver with the SEC. This code of ethics and business conduct can be found in the corporate governance section of our website, https://investors.aytubio.com/corporate-governance#CorporateGovernance . ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Investing in our securities includes a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the specific factors discussed below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. This could cause the market price of our securities to decline and could cause you to lose all or part of your investment. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL POSITION We have incurred losses to date and can give no assurance of profitability. We have incurred losses in each year since our inception. As of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there is a substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our net loss for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was 17.1 million and 108.8 million, respectively. We have not demonstrated the ability to be a profit-generating enterprise to date. Even though we expect to have revenue growth in the next several fiscal years, it is uncertain that the revenue growth will be significant enough to offset our expenses and generate a profit in the future. Potential investors should evaluate us in light of the expenses, delays, uncertainties, and complications typically encountered by healthcare businesses, many of which will be beyond our control. These risks include the following: uncertain market acceptance of our products; difficulties in maintaining coverage and reimbursement for our products; lack of sufficient capital; U.S. and foreign regulatory approval of our products; unanticipated problems, delays, and expense relating to product development and implementation; lack of sufficient intellectual property; the ability to attract and retain qualified employees; competition; and technological changes. As a result of the increasingly competitive nature of the markets in which we compete, our historical financial data is of limited value in anticipating future operating expenses. Our planned expense levels will be based in part on our 
 22 

Table of Contents 
 expectations concerning future operations, which is difficult to forecast accurately based on our historical strategy of product and/or business acquisition to develop our product and business portfolio. We may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected budgetary shortfall. To obtain revenues from our products, we must succeed, either alone or with others, in a range of challenging activities, including expanding markets for our existing products, manufacturing, marketing and selling our existing products, satisfying any post-marketing requirements, and obtaining reimbursement for our products from private insurance or government payors. We, and our collaborators, as applicable, may not be successful in these activities and, even if we or our collaborators do, we may never generate revenues that are sufficient to achieve profitability. We have not established sources of ongoing revenue sufficient to cover operating costs and allow us to continue as a going concern. Since our inception, we have had significant operating losses. As of June 30, 2023, we had accumulated deficit of 304.1 million. Even though we plan to mitigate the conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, we may continue to incur net losses, and our ability to generate positive cash flows from operating activities is uncertain for the foreseeable future. We have not established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover operating costs. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our continued operational improvements, refinancing, or obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until we become profitable. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain adequate capital, we may be unable to develop and commercialize our product offerings and we could be forced to cease operations. We may need to raise additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product expansion efforts or other operations. Further, future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock will result in dilution of the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall. We are expending resources to commercialize our prescription products and to service our debt obligations. We may require additional funding through public or private equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or a combination of these approaches. As of June 30, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents totaled 23.0 million. During the year ended June 30, 2023, we raised approximately 15.6 million, net of fees, from a combination of common stock offerings. Our operating plans may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we could need additional capital in the future to continue our operations and may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. Raising funds in the current economic environment may present additional challenges. Even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital if market conditions are favorable or if we have specific strategic considerations. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, any such sales may result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of our existing common stockholders. Further, any future sales of our common stock by us or resales of our common stock by our existing stockholders could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Any future grants of securities exercisable or convertible into our common stock, or the exercise or conversion of such shares, and any sales of such shares in the market, could also have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and we may be required to agree to additional restrictive covenants, such as further limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, additional limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. We could also be required to seek 
 23 

Table of Contents 
 funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or products or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be unable to expand the market for our products or expand our operations generally or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not have cash available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make interest or principal payments on our indebtedness when due. We have a 15.0 million term loan with Avenue Capital and up to 14.5 million of secured revolving loans with Eclipse. As of June 30, 2023, 1.6 million was outstanding under the secured revolving loan. All obligations under our loans are secured by substantially all of our existing property and assets subject to certain exceptions. These debt financings and any future debt financings may create additional financial risk for us, particularly if our business or prevailing financial market conditions are not conducive to paying off or refinancing our outstanding debt obligations at maturity. As a result, we may not have sufficient funds, or may be unable to arrange for additional financing, to pay the amounts due on our outstanding indebtedness under our debt agreements. Further, funds from external sources may not be available on economically acceptable terms, if at all. For example, if we raise additional funds through collaboration, licensing or other similar arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our products or technologies, or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If adequate funds are not available when and if needed, our ability to make interest or principal payments on our debt obligations, and finance our operations and other general corporate activities would be significantly limited and we may be required to delay, significantly curtail, or eliminate one or more of our programs. Failure to satisfy our current and future debt obligations under our loan agreements with Avenue Capital or Eclipse could result in an event of default and, as a result, our lenders could accelerate all of the amounts due. In the event of an acceleration of amounts due under one or both of our debt agreements as a result of an event of default, we may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to repay our indebtedness. In addition, our lenders could seek to enforce their security interests in any collateral securing such indebtedness. The terms of our loan agreement place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, the terms of any new debt could further restrict our operating and financial flexibility. The loan agreements with Avenue Capital and Eclipse subject us to financial covenants and restrictions on our ability to incur liens, incur additional indebtedness, make certain dividends and distributions with respect to equity securities, engage in mergers and acquisitions or make asset sales without the prior written consent of the lender. Failure to comply with such covenants could permit the lenders to declare our obligations under the loan agreements, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable, plus any applicable additional amounts relating to a prepayment or termination. These restrictive covenants could limit our flexibility in operating our business and our ability to pursue business opportunities that we or our stockholders may consider beneficial. Any declaration by the lender of an event of default could significantly harm our business and prospects and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. We may not have enough available cash or be able to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings to repay these outstanding obligations at the time any event of default occurs. Further, if we raise any additional capital through debt financing, the terms of such additional debt could further restrict our operating and financial flexibility.

 We recently announced that we have been engaged in discussions with various parties regarding potential strategic transactions and potential financing options. There can be no assurance that this process will result in the pursuit or consummation of any potential transaction, or that any such potential transaction, if implemented, will provide sufficient funding to continue our operations. We recently announced that we are engaged in discussions with various parties regarding potential strategic transactions and potential financing, which could include a financing, sale or licensing of assets, acquisition, merger, business combination, and/or other strategic transaction or series of related transactions. This process, including any uncertainty created by this process, involves a number of risks which could impact our business and our stockholders, including the following: significant fluctuations in our stock price could occur in response to developments relating to the process or market speculation regarding any such developments; we may encounter difficulties in hiring, retaining and motivating key personnel during this process or as a result of uncertainties generated by this process or any developments or actions relating to it; we may incur substantial increases in general and administrative expense associated with increased legal fees and the need to retain and compensate third-party advisors; and we may experience difficulties in preserving the commercially sensitive information that may need to be disclosed to third parties during this process or in connection with an assessment of our strategic options. The review process also requires significant time and attention from management, which could distract them from other tasks in operating our business or otherwise disrupt our business. Such disruptions could cause concern to our suppliers, strategic partners or other constituencies and may have a material impact on our business and operating results and volatility in our share price. There can be no assurance that this process will result in the pursuit or consummation of any potential transaction or strategy, or that any such potential transaction or strategy, if implemented, will provide sufficient funding to conduct our operations. Any outcome of this process would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other things, market conditions, industry trends, regulatory approvals, and the availability of financing on reasonable terms. The occurrence of any one or more of the above risks could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have indefinitely suspended development of our AR101 (enzastaurin) clinical development program and shifted our strategic focus towards accelerating the growth of our commercial business. If we fail to execute successfully on this reprioritized strategic focus, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. We have indefinitely suspended our AR101 (enzastaurin) clinical development program and shifted our focus towards accelerating the growth of our commercial business and achieving operating cash flows. Though we expect that the suspension of this program will save over 20 million in projected future study costs over the next three fiscal years, the process of reorienting our business strategy may be costly, time consuming and complex, and we have incurred, and may in the future incur, costs related to this strategic shift. Our strategic reprioritization may result in unexpected expenses or liabilities and/or write-offs. There is no assurance that we will be successful at executing on our revised strategy or that any particular course of action, business arrangement or transaction, or series of transactions, will be pursued, successfully consummated, lead to increased stockholder value, or achieve the anticipated results. If we are unable to execute successfully on our reprioritized strategic focus, our cash resources may not last as long as estimated and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.

 Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. As of June 30, 2023, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 504.0 million. The available net operating losses, if not utilized to offset taxable income in future periods, will begin to expire in 2024 and, except for certain indefinite-lived net operating loss carryforwards, will completely expire in 2037. Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, including, without limitation, the consolidated income tax return regulations, various corporate ownership changes could limit our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset our income. An ownership change (generally a 50 change in equity ownership over a three-year period) under Section 382 of the Code could limit our ability to offset, post-change, our U.S. federal taxable income. Section 382 of the Code imposes an annual limitation on the amount of post-ownership change taxable income a corporation may offset with pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and certain recognized built-in losses. We believe that the June 2021 acquisition of Neos caused an ownership change of Neos, resulting in a limitation in our ability to use their pre-acquisition net operating loss carryovers. We also believe that the financing transactions in fiscal 2022 and 2023 may have caused, together with equity ownership changes in the past three years, an ownership change resulting in a limitation of our ability to use our pre-acquisition net operating loss carryovers. The ownership change scenario could result in an increased future tax liability to us. If we fail to establish and maintain proper internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, and concluded that a certain control was not effective. We concluded that we had a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to accounting for complex warrant issuances and the classification of these issued warrants. In addition, we concluded that we had a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting for the year ended June 30, 2023 related to our analysis for the accounting for valuation of our inventory. Our Audit Committee conducted an internal investigation to identify and determine plans to remediate the material weaknesses and to enhance our overall control environment. We will not consider the material weaknesses remediated until our enhanced control is operational for a sufficient period of time and tested, enabling management to conclude that the enhanced controls are operating effectively. Our remediation plan includes the implementation of controls over the process of reviewing significant and complex contracts and agreements and we believe that the issues have been remediated. If in the future we were to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective, we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing and remediation actions or their effect on our operations because there is presently no precedent available by which to measure compliance adequacy. As a consequence, we may not be able to complete any necessary remediation process in time to meet our deadline for compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Also, there can be no assurance that we will not identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal controls in connection with evaluating our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The presence of material weaknesses could result in financial statement errors which, in turn, could require us to restate our operating results. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting or if our independent auditors are unwilling or unable to provide us, when required, with an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, investors may lose confidence in our operating results, our stock price could decline and we may be subject to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. In addition, if we are unable to meet the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to maintain listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market. Due to our current filing status, we are not required to have our independent registered public accounting firm deliver an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

 We have been and in the future may become a defendant in one or more stockholder derivative, class-action, and other litigation, and any such lawsuits may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We and certain of our officers and directors have been and may in the future become defendants in one or more stockholder derivative actions or other class-action lawsuits. For example: Two putative class action lawsuits were filed on February 9, 2022 and March 7, 2022 derivatively and on behalf of all Aytu stockholders, challenging the grant in 2021 of certain stock option awards to directors and officers, and seeking rescission of the awards, unspecified damages to stockholders as a result of the awards, and attorneys fees. A shareholder derivative suit was filed on September 12, 2022, derivatively and on behalf of all Aytu stockholders, against certain of our current and former directors and stockholders, alleging breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with certain acquisitions, and seeking unspecified damages, equitable relief, restitution, disgorgement of profits, enhanced governance and internal procedures, and attorneys fees. 
 See Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings for more information on these lawsuits. These lawsuits can divert our management s attention and resources from our ordinary business operations, and we would likely incur significant expenses associated with their defense (including, without limitation, substantial attorneys fees and other fees of professional advisors and potential obligations to indemnify current and former officers and directors who are or may become parties to such actions). In connection with these lawsuits, we may be required to pay material damages, consent to injunctions on future conduct and/or suffer other penalties, remedies or sanctions, or issue additional shares upon the exercise of certain warrants, which may cause additional dilution. In addition, any such future lawsuits could adversely impact our reputation and/or ability to launch and commercialize our products, thereby harming our ability to generate revenue. Accordingly, the ultimate resolution of these matters and any future matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flow and, consequently, could negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. RISKS RELATED TO COMMERCIALIZATION We are heavily dependent on the commercial success of our commercial products. To date, we have not generated sufficient revenues from the sales of these products to achieve profitability and we may never achieve or maintain profitability. Our ability to become profitable depends upon our ability to generate increased revenues from sales of our prescription and consumer health product portfolios. While we have been selling pharmaceutical products for several years, we have limited commercial experience selling our current lineup of pharmaceutical products, having only generated revenues from the sale of our pediatric products since acquiring that portfolio in November 2019 and from our ADHD products since acquiring that portfolio in March 2021. None of our marketed prescription or consumer health products have thus far generated product sales revenues at levels sufficient for us to attain profitability. We have not generated any revenues from product sales of any other product candidates and, to date, have incurred significant operating losses. We have incurred, and anticipate continuing to incur, significant costs associated with commercialization of our approved products and, if approved, any other product candidates that we may develop. It is possible that we will never attain sufficient product sales revenues to achieve profitability.

 If we are unable to differentiate our products from branded drugs or existing generic therapies for similar treatments, or if the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities approve additional generic products that compete with any of our products, our ability to successfully commercialize such products would be adversely affected. We expect to compete against branded drugs with distinct clinical attributes and to compete with their generic counterparts that will be sold for a lower price. Although we believe that our Rx Portfolio is or will be differentiated from branded drugs and their generic counterparts, if any, including through clinical efficacy or through improved patient compliance, ease of administration, and our patient support programs, it is possible that such differentiation will not impact our market position. If we are unable to achieve significant differentiation for our products and accompanying support services against other drugs, the opportunity for our products to achieve premium pricing and be commercialized successfully would be adversely affected. After a New Drug Application NDA ), including a 505(b)(2) application, is approved, the covered product becomes a listed drug that, in turn, can be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. The FDCA, implementing regulations and other applicable laws provide incentives to manufacturers to create modified, non-infringing versions of a drug to facilitate the approval of an ANDA or other application for generic substitutes. These manufacturers might only be required to conduct a relatively inexpensive study to show that their product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration, and conditions of use, or labeling as our product candidate and that the generic product is bioequivalent to ours, meaning it is absorbed in the body at the same rate and to the same extent as our product candidate. These generic equivalents, which must meet the same quality standards as the listed drugs, would be significantly less costly than ours to bring to market and companies that produce generic equivalents are generally able to offer their products at lower prices. Thus, after the introduction of a generic competitor, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product, such as our Rx Portfolio products, can be lost to the generic version. Accordingly, competition from generic equivalents to our products could materially adversely impact our revenues, profitability and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on the investments we have made in our products. For example, on July 25, 2016, Neos received a paragraph IV certification from Actavis advising them that Actavis filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of Adzenys XR-ODT. On October 17, 2017, Neos entered into a Settlement Agreement and a Licensing Agreement with Actavis (which is now owned by Teva), pursuant to which Neos granted Actavis the right to manufacture and market its now approved generic version of Adzenys XR-ODT under the ANDA beginning on September 1, 2025, or earlier under certain circumstances. On October 31, 2017, Neos received a paragraph IV certification from Teva advising them that Teva filed an ANDA with the FDA for a generic version of Cotempla XR-ODT. On December 21, 2018, Neos entered into a Settlement Agreement and a Licensing Agreement with Teva, pursuant to which we have granted Teva the right to manufacture and market its now approved generic version of Cotempla XR-ODT under the ANDA beginning on July 1, 2026, or earlier under certain circumstances. While we expect to wind down or monetize our Consumer Health Segment, the Consumer Health Segment relies heavily on obtaining products that change from a prescription to over the counter through an FDA approval process. Any delays in this process might impact the financial performance of our consumer Health Segment. Our Consumer Health Segment has pursued opportunities where existing prescription drugs have recently, or are expected to, change from a prescription to over-the-counter. Historically the FDA has highly scrutinized any product application submitted to switch a product from prescription to unsupervised over-the-counter use by the general public. The continued expansion of Rx-to-OTC switches is important to our Consumer Health Segment s future growth. Reluctance of FDA to approve Rx-to-OTC switches in new product categories could impact that growth and could impact the financial performance of our Consumer Health Segment. Our pharmaceutical and consumer health products may prove to be difficult to effectively commercialize as planned or on the timeframes we announce and expect. Various commercial, regulatory, and manufacturing factors may impact our ability to maintain or grow revenues from sales of our pharmaceutical and consumer health product offerings. Moreover, we have limited

 experience selling some of our current products given their acquisition from other companies or their recent approval. We sometimes estimate for planning purposes the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory, and other product development objectives and, from time to time, we may publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones. The achievement of many of these milestones may be outside of our control and if we fail to achieve announced milestones in the timeframes we announce and expect, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and our business, prospects and results of operations may be harmed. Specifically, we may encounter difficulty by virtue of the following, each of which could be negatively impacted if expected timeframe goals are not achieved: our available capital resources; our inability to have clear proprietary rights to the products; our inability to manufacture or cost-effectively manufacture the products; our inability to adequately market and increase sales of any of these products; existence of adverse side effects that make using the products less desirable; our inability to attract and retain a skilled support team, marketing staff and sales force necessary to increase the market for our approved products and to maintain market acceptance for our products; our inability to secure continuing prescribing of any of these products by current or previous users of the product; our inability to effectively transfer and scale manufacturing as needed to maintain an adequate commercial supply of these products; reimbursement and medical policy changes that may adversely affect the pricing, profitability or commercial appeal of pharmaceutical products; and our inability to effectively identify and align with commercial partners outside the U.S., or the inability of those selected partners to gain the required regulatory, reimbursement, and other approvals needed to enable commercial success of our products. We rely on limited sources of supply for our products, and any disruption in the chain of supply may impact production and sales of our products, and cause delays in developing and commercializing our currently manufactured and commercialized products. Some of our products are produced in single annual production lots by single-source suppliers. Due to the limited production quantities, production of these lots may not be prioritized by the third-party manufacturer, and may not be scheduled and produced at all. We are reliant on a limited number of suppliers for resin, drug compounds, coating and other component substances of our final products. If any of these single source suppliers were to breach or terminate its supply agreement, if any, with us or otherwise not supply us, we would need to identify an alternative source for the supply of component substances for our products. If we fail to procure supply of our products, we could lose potential revenue and our business, financial condition, results of operation and reputation could be adversely affected. Identifying an appropriately qualified source of alternative supply for any one or more of the component substances for our products could be time consuming, and we may not be able to do so without incurring material delays in the development and commercialization of our approved products or a decrease in sales of our approved products, which could harm our financial position and commercial potential for our products. Any alternative vendor would also need to be qualified through an FDA Prior Approval Supplement process which could result in further delay. The FDA, DEA, or other regulatory agencies outside of the United States may also require additional studies if we enter into

 agreements with new suppliers for the manufacture of our ADHD products that differ from the suppliers used for clinical development of such products. These factors could cause the delay of commercialization of our products, cause us to incur higher costs and prevent us from commercializing them successfully. Furthermore, if our suppliers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of components and APIs on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, including if our suppliers did not receive adequate DEA quotas for the supply of certain scheduled components, and we are unable to secure one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, commercialization of our ADHD products may be delayed or we could lose potential revenue and our business, financial condition, results of operation and reputation could be adversely affected. We rely on third parties manufacture certain products, and third-party manufacturing risks and inefficiencies may result in costs and delays that prevent us from successfully commercializing products and adversely affect our ability to produce our products. Our ADHD products are currently manufactured in our own production facility in Grand Prairie, Texas. We are in the process of outsourcing the manufacturing of our ADHD products to a third-party manufacturer to produce commercial quantities of our ADHD products beginning in late calendar 2023 or early calendar 2024. If the third party is not successful or does not meet our expectations (for example, timeliness of production, quantity of production, maintenance of needed documentation or regulatory compliance), we may have to find a different manufacturer and incur expenses and delays in the process. Manufacturers of our ADHD products must comply with good manufacturing practice GMP requirements enforced by the FDA, NMPA, EMA and other comparable foreign health authorities through facilities inspection programs. These requirements include quality control, quality assurance, and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our FDA regulated products may be unable to comply with these GMP requirements and with other FDA, NMPA, EMA, DEA, state, and foreign regulatory requirements. A failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval. If the safety of any quantities supplied is compromised due to a manufacturer s failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our drugs, which would seriously harm our business. For all other products and any future product, we expect to use third-party manufacturers because we do not expect to have our own manufacturing capabilities. In determining the required quantities of any product and the manufacturing schedule, we must make significant judgments and estimates based on inventory levels, current market trends and other related factors. Because of the inherent nature of estimates and our limited experience in marketing our current products, there could be significant differences between our estimates and the actual amounts of product we require. If we do not effectively maintain our supply agreements, we will face difficulty finding replacement suppliers, which could harm sales of those products. If we fail in similar endeavors for future products, we may not be successful in establishing or continuing the commercialization of our products. Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured these components ourselves, including: reliance on third parties for regulatory compliance and quality assurance; possible breaches of manufacturing agreements by the third parties because of factors beyond our control; possible regulatory violations or manufacturing problems experienced by our suppliers; and possible termination or non-renewal of agreements by third parties, based on their own business priorities, at times that are costly or inconvenient for us. Further, if we are unable to secure the needed financing to fund our internal operations, we may not have adequate resources required to effectively and rapidly transition to a third-party CMO for our ADHD products. We may

 not be able to meet the demand for our products if one or more of any third-party manufacturers is unable to supply us with the necessary components that meet our specifications. It may be difficult to find alternate suppliers for any of our products in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to us. The manufacturing processes and facilities of third-party manufacturers we have engaged for our current approved products are, and any future third-party manufacturer will be, required to comply with the federal Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which covers procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of devices. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections of manufacturing facilities. Any inspection by the FDA could lead to additional compliance requests that could cause delays in our product commercialization. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements, or later discovery of previously unknown problems with the manufacturing processes and facilities of third-party manufacturers we engage, including the failure to take satisfactory corrective actions in response to an adverse QSR inspection, can result in, among other things: administrative or judicially imposed sanctions; injunctions or the imposition of civil penalties; recall or seizure of the product in question; total or partial suspension of production or distribution; the FDA s refusal to grant pending future clearance or pre-market approval; withdrawal or suspension of marketing clearances or approvals; clinical holds; warning letters; refusal to permit the export of the product in question; and criminal prosecution. Any of these actions, in combination or alone, could prevent us from marketing, distributing or selling our products, and would likely harm our business. In addition, a product defect or regulatory violation could lead to a government-mandated or voluntary recall by us. We believe the FDA would request that we initiate a voluntary recall if a product was defective or presented a risk of injury or gross deception. Regulatory agencies in other countries have similar authority to recall drugs or devices because of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture that could endanger health. Any recall would divert our management attention and financial resources, expose us to product liability or other claims, and harm our reputation with customers. Third party performance failures may increase our development costs, delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval, and delay or prevent the commercialization of our products. While we believe that there are numerous alternative sources to provide these services, in the event that we seek such alternative sources, we may not be able to enter into replacement arrangements without incurring delays or additional costs.

 If we or our contract manufacturer fail to manufacture our ADHD products in sufficient quantities and at acceptable quality and pricing levels, or fail to obtain adequate DEA quotas for controlled substances, or to fully comply with cGMP regulations, we may face delays in the commercialization of these products, or be unable to meet market demand, and may be unable to generate potential revenues. The manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls, and the use of specialized processing equipment. Pharmaceutical companies often encounter difficulties in manufacturing, particularly in scaling up production of their products. These problems include manufacturing difficulties relating to production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product and quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with federal, state, and foreign regulations. If we are unable to demonstrate stability in accordance with commercial requirements, or if our raw material manufacturers were to encounter difficulties or otherwise fail to comply with their obligations to us, our ability to obtain FDA approval and market our products would be jeopardized. We purchase raw materials and components from various suppliers in order to manufacture our ADHD products. If we are unable to source the required raw materials from our suppliers, or if we do not obtain DEA quotas or receive inadequate DEA quotas, we may experience delays in manufacturing our ADHD products, and may not be able to meet customer demand for our products. In addition, we and our contract manufacturer must comply with federal, state, and foreign regulations, including cGMP requirements enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. We may be unable to comply with these cGMP requirements and with other FDA and foreign regulatory requirements. A failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or voluntary recall, or withdrawal of product approval. If the safety of any of our products is compromised due to failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain, or to maintain once obtained, regulatory approval for such products or successfully commercialize such products, and we may be held liable for any injuries sustained as a result. Any of these factors could cause a delay in commercialization of our products, entail higher costs or adversely impact our commercialization of our products. Any manufacturing defect or error discovered after products have been produced and distributed could result in even more significant consequences, including costly recall procedures, re-stocking costs, damage to our reputation and potential for product liability claims. If our manufacturing facility becomes damaged or inoperable or we decide to or are required to vacate our facility, our ability to manufacture our ADHD products may be jeopardized. Our inability to continue manufacturing adequate supplies of our products could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues. While we are in the process of transferring manufacturing at our Grand Prairie, Texas facility to a third-party manufacturer, all of our ADHD products manufacturing capabilities are currently housed in our sole manufacturing facility located in Grand Prairie, Texas. Our facility and equipment could be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or manmade disasters, including war, fire, tornado, power loss, communications failure or terrorism, any of which may render it difficult or impossible for us to operate our drug delivery technology platform and manufacture our products for some period of time. While we seek to maintain finished goods inventory of our products outside of this facility, it is unlikely that the level of such inventory would be sufficient if we were to sustain anything other than a short-term disruption in our ability to manufacture our products at our Grand Prairie, Texas facility. The inability to manufacture our products if our facility or our equipment is inoperable, for even a short period of time, may result in the loss of customers or harm to our reputation, and we may be unable to regain those customers or repair our reputation in the future. Furthermore, our facility and the equipment we use to manufacture our products could become damaged and time consuming to repair or replace. It would be difficult, time consuming and expensive to rebuild our facility or repair or replace our equipment or to complete the transfer of our proprietary technology to a third party, particularly in light of the requirements for a DEA registered manufacturing and storage facility like ours and FDA site change requirements. We carry insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, but this insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with damage or disruption to our business, may not provide coverage in amounts sufficient to cover our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. An

 inability to continue manufacturing adequate supplies of our ADHD products at our Grand Prairie, Texas facility could result in a disruption in the supply of our products to physicians and pharmacies, which would adversely affect our ability to generate revenues. In conjunction with transferring the manufacturing of our ADHD products to a CMO, we entered into an agreement with AMT Manufacturing Solutions, LLC to sublease approximately 30 of our Grand Prairie, Texas manufacturing facility. Commencing as early as April 1, 2024, but no later than December 31, 2024, the sublease will be expanded to include the remaining portion of the manufacturing facility. If we do not secure collaborations with strategic partners to test, commercialize and manufacture products, we may not be able to successfully develop products and generate meaningful revenues. We may enter into collaborations with third parties to commercialize and manufacture our products. If we are able to identify and reach an agreement with one or more collaborators, our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements. Collaboration agreements typically call for milestone payments that depend on successful demonstration of efficacy and safety, obtaining regulatory approvals, and clinical trial results. Collaboration revenues are not guaranteed, even when efficacy and safety are demonstrated. Further, the economic environment at any given time may result in potential collaborators electing to reduce their external spending, which may prevent us from developing our products. Collaboration agreements typically provide for the ownership of intellectual property. In some instances, there may not be adequate written provisions to address clearly the resolution of intellectual property rights that may arise from a collaboration and we may be limited in our ability to use, make or sell these inventions. Litigation may be necessary to resolve an ownership dispute, and if we are not successful, we may be precluded from using certain intellectual property, or may lose our exclusive rights in that intellectual property. Even if we succeed in securing collaborators, the collaborators may fail to develop or effectively commercialize our products. Collaborations involving our products pose a number of risks, including the following: collaborators may not have sufficient resources or may decide not to devote the necessary resources due to internal constraints such as budget limitations, lack of human resources, or a change in strategic focus; collaborators may believe our intellectual property is not valid or is unenforceable or the product candidate infringes on the intellectual property rights of others; collaborators may dispute their responsibility to conduct development and commercialization activities pursuant to the applicable collaboration, including the payment of related costs or the division of any revenues; collaborators may decide to pursue a competitive product developed outside of the collaboration arrangement; collaborators may not be able to obtain, or believe they cannot obtain, the necessary regulatory approvals; collaborators may delay the development or commercialization of our products in favor of developing or commercializing their own or another party s products; or collaborators may decide to terminate or not to renew the collaboration for these or other reasons. As a result, collaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of our products in the most efficient manner or at all.

 Collaboration agreements are generally terminable without cause on short notice. Once a collaboration agreement is signed, it may not lead to commercialization of a product. We also face competition in seeking out collaborators. If we are unable to secure collaborations that achieve the collaborator s objectives and meet our expectations, we may be unable to advance our products and may not generate meaningful revenues. We face substantial competition from companies with considerably more resources and experience than we have, which may result in others discovering, developing, receiving approval for, or commercializing products before or more successfully than us. The biopharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We compete with companies that design, manufacture and market already-existing and new products. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market with new technologies and/or our competitors improve their current products. One or more of our competitors may offer technology superior to ours and render our technology obsolete or uneconomical. Most of our current competitors, as well as many of our potential competitors, have greater name recognition, more substantial intellectual property portfolios, longer operating histories, significantly greater resources to invest in new technologies, more substantial experience in product marketing and new product development, greater regulatory expertise, more extensive manufacturing capabilities and the distribution channels to deliver products to customers. Our competitors may be more successful in acquiring new products than we are. If we fail to acquire new products, implementation of our business plan would be delayed, which could have a negative adverse effect on our business and prospects. If we are not able to compete successfully, we may not generate sufficient revenue to become profitable. Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to: expand the market for our approved products, especially our pharmaceutical and devices regulated by the FDA; successfully commercialize our products alone or with commercial partners; discover and develop products that are superior to other products in the market; obtain required regulatory approvals; attract and retain qualified personnel; and obtain patent and/or other proprietary protection for our products. Established pharmaceutical companies devote significant financial resources to discovering, developing or licensing novel compounds that could make our products obsolete. Our competitors may obtain patent protection, receive FDA approval, and commercialize medicines before us. Other companies are or may become engaged in the discovery of compounds that may compete with the products we are developing. We compete with companies that design, manufacture and market treatments that compete with our products. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and more experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. As a result, these companies may obtain regulatory approval more rapidly than we are able and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products as well. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis drug products or drug delivery technologies that are more effective or less costly than that of our products or any product candidate that we are currently developing or that we may develop.

 We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market with new technologies and our competitors improve their current products. One or more of our competitors may offer technology superior to ours and render our technology obsolete or uneconomical. Most of our current competitors, as well as many of our potential competitors, have greater name recognition, more substantial intellectual property portfolios, longer operating histories, significantly greater resources to invest in new technologies, more substantial experience in new product development, greater regulatory expertise, more extensive manufacturing capabilities and the distribution channels to deliver products to customers. If we are not able to compete successfully, we may not generate sufficient revenue to become profitable. If we are not able to compete effectively against our current and future competitors, our business will not grow, and our financial condition and operations will suffer. Government restrictions on pricing and reimbursement, as well as other healthcare payor cost-containment initiatives, may negatively impact our ability to generate revenues. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of health care costs to contain or reduce costs of health care may adversely affect one or more of the following: our or our collaborators ability to set a price we believe is fair for our approved products; our ability to generate revenue from our approved products and achieve profitability; and the availability of capital. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Health Care Reconciliation Act, significantly impacted the provision of, and payment for, health care in the U.S. Various provisions of these laws are designed to expand Medicaid eligibility, subsidize insurance premiums, provide incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibit denials of coverage due to pre-existing conditions, establish health insurance exchanges, and provide additional support for medical research. Amendments to the PPACA and/or the Health Care Reconciliation Act, as well as new legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs, along with the trend toward managed healthcare in the U.S., could influence the purchase of medicines and medical devices and reduce demand and prices for our products, if approved. This could harm our or our collaborators ability to market any approved products and generate revenues. As we expect to receive significant revenues from reimbursement of our Rx Portfolio products by commercial third-party payors and government payors, cost containment measures that health care payors and providers are instituting and the effect of further health care reform could significantly reduce potential revenues from the sale of any of our products approved in the future, and could cause an increase in our compliance, manufacturing or other operating expenses. In addition, in certain foreign markets, the pricing of prescription drugs and devices is subject to government control and reimbursement may in some cases be unavailable. We believe that pricing pressures at the federal and state level, as well as internationally, will continue and may increase, which may make it difficult for us to sell any approved product at a price acceptable to us or any of our future collaborators. In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug or medical device must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. A member state may require that physicians prescribe the generic version of a drug instead of our approved branded product. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products or product candidates. Historically, pharmaceutical products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to have significantly lower prices.

 Our financial results will depend on the acceptance among clinicians, third-party payors and the medical community of our products. Physicians may not choose to prescribe our products if we or any collaborator is unable to demonstrate that, based on experience, clinical data, side-effect profiles and other factors, our product is preferable to existing medicines or treatments. Our future success depends on the acceptance by our target customers, third-party payors, and the medical community that our products are reliable, safe, and cost-effective. We cannot predict the degree of market acceptance of any of our approved products. Many factors may affect the market acceptance and commercial success of our products, including: our ability to convince our potential customers of the advantages, safety and economic value our products and product candidates over existing technologies and products; the approved labeling for the product and any required warnings; the prevalence and severity of adverse events or publicity; potential product liability claims the relative convenience and ease of our products over existing technologies and products; the introduction of new technologies and competing products that may make our products less attractive for our target customers; our success in training medical personnel on the proper use of our products; the willingness of third-party payors to reimburse our target customers that adopt our products; increases in rebate payments with payors; the acceptance in the medical community of our products; the extent and success of our manufacturing, marketing, and sales efforts; and general economic conditions. If our future products fail to gain market access and acceptance, this will have a material adverse impact on our ability to generate revenue to provide a satisfactory, or any, return on our investments. Even if some therapies achieve market access and acceptance, the market may prove not to be large enough to allow us to generate significant revenue. If third-party payors do not reimburse our customers for the products we sell or if reimbursement levels are set too low for us to sell one or more of our products at a profit, our ability to sell those products and our results of operations will be harmed. While our pharmaceutical products are approved and generating revenues in the U.S., they may not receive, or continue to receive, clinician or patient acceptance, or they may not maintain adequate reimbursement from third party payors. In the future, we might possibly sell other products to target customers substantially all of whom receive reimbursement for the health care services they provide to their patients from third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid, other domestic and foreign government programs, private insurance plans and managed care programs. Reimbursement decisions by particular third-party payors depend upon a number of factors, including each third-party payor s determination that use of a product is: a covered benefit under its health plan; 
 36 

Table of Contents 
 appropriate and medically necessary for the specific indication; cost effective; and neither experimental nor investigational. Third-party payors may deny reimbursement for covered products if they determine that a medical product was not used in accordance with cost-effective diagnosis methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an unapproved indication. Third-party payors also may refuse to reimburse for procedures and devices deemed to be experimental. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from each government or third-party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our potential product to each government or third-party payor. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. In addition, eligibility for coverage does not imply that any product will be covered and reimbursed in all cases or reimbursed at a rate that allows our potential customers to make a profit or even cover their costs. Third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services. Levels of reimbursement may decrease in the future, and future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors may adversely affect the demand for and reimbursement available for any product or product candidate, which in turn, could negatively impact pricing. If our customers are not adequately reimbursed for our products, they may reduce or discontinue purchases of our products, which would result in a significant shortfall in achieving revenue expectations and negatively impact our business, prospects and financial condition. Reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and other governmental drug pricing programs are complex and may involve subjective decisions. Any failure to comply with those obligations could subject us to penalties and sanctions . As a condition of reimbursement by various federal and state health insurance programs, pharmaceutical companies are required to calculate and report certain pricing information to federal and state agencies. The regulations governing the calculations, price reporting and payment obligations are complex and subject to interpretation by various government and regulatory agencies, as well as the courts. Reasonable assumptions have been made where there is a lack of regulations or clear guidance and such assumptions involve subjective decisions and estimates. Pharmaceutical companies are required to report any revisions to their calculations, price reporting and payment obligations previously reported or paid. Such revisions could affect liability to federal and state payers and also adversely impact reported financial results of operations in the period of such restatement. Uncertainty exists as new laws, regulations, judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, or regulations related to our calculations, price reporting or payments obligations increases the chances of a legal challenge, restatement or investigation. If a company becomes subject to investigations, restatements, or other inquiries concerning compliance with price reporting laws and regulations, it could be required to pay or be subject to additional reimbursements, penalties, sanctions or fines, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that future healthcare reform measures could be adopted, which could result in increased pressure on pricing and reimbursement of products and thus have an adverse impact on financial position or business operations. Further, state Medicaid programs may be slow to invoice pharmaceutical companies for calculated rebates resulting in a lag between the time a sale is recorded and the time the rebate is paid. This results in a company having to carry a liability on its consolidated balance sheets for the estimate of rebate claims expected for Medicaid patients. If actual claims are higher than current estimates, the company s financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.

 In addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B Program refunds, if a pharmaceutical firm is found to have knowingly submitted any false price information related to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS ), it may be liable for civil monetary penalties. Such failure could also be grounds for CMS to terminate the Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which companies participate in the Medicaid program. In the event that CMS terminates a rebate agreement, federal payments may not be available under government programs, including Medicaid or Medicare Part B, for covered outpatient drugs. Additionally, if a pharmaceutical company overcharges the government in connection with the FSS program or Tricare Retail Pharmacy Program, whether due to a misstated Federal Ceiling Price or otherwise, it is required to refund the difference to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in allegations against a company under the FCA and other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and responding to a government investigation or enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Our collaborators are also subject to similar requirements outside of the U.S. and thus the attendant risks and uncertainties. If our collaborators suffer material and adverse effects from such risks and uncertainties, our rights and benefits for our licensed products could be negatively impacted, which could have a material and adverse impact on our revenues. Our future growth may depend, in part, on our ability to penetrate foreign markets, where we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and other risks and uncertainties. Our future profitability may depend, in part, on our ability to commercialize our products in foreign markets for which we intend to primarily rely on collaboration with third parties such as the agreement we entered into with Medomie Pharma Ltd. in July 2023 to sell Adzenys and Cotempla in Israel and the Palestinian Authority. If we commercialize our products in foreign markets, we would be subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including: our inability to directly control commercial activities because we are relying on third parties; the burden of complying with complex and changing foreign regulatory, tax, accounting and legal requirements; different medical practices and customs in foreign countries affecting acceptance in the marketplace; import or export licensing requirements; longer accounts receivable collection times; longer lead times for shipping; language barriers for technical training; reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries, and related prevalence of generic alternatives to our products; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; our customers ability to obtain reimbursement for our products in foreign markets; and the interpretation of contractual provisions governed by foreign laws in the event of a contract dispute. Foreign sales of our products could also be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls, political and economic instability, trade restrictions and changes in tariffs.

 We are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws with respect to our operations and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal and/or civil liability and harm our business. We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and other state and national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, third-party intermediaries, joint venture partners and collaborators from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. We may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities, and other organizations. In addition, we may engage third party intermediaries to obtain necessary permits, licenses, and other regulatory approvals. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that mandates compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws applicable to our business throughout the world. We cannot ensure, however, that our employees and third party intermediaries will comply with this code or such anti-corruption laws. Noncompliance with anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension and/or debarment from contracting with certain persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage, and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas, investigations, or other enforcement actions are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed. In addition, responding to any such action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management s attention and resources and significant defense and compliance costs and other professional fees. In certain cases, enforcement authorities may even cause us to appoint an independent compliance monitor which can result in added costs and administrative burdens. We are subject to various health care fraud and abuse and reimbursement laws pertaining to the marketing of our approved products. We are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including prohibitions on the offer of payment or acceptance of kickbacks or other remuneration for the purchase of our products, including inducements to potential patients to request our products and services. Additionally, any product promotion educational activities, support of continuing medical education programs, and other interactions with health-care professionals must be conducted in a manner consistent with the FDA regulations, Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and the Anti-Kickback Statute. The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can also carry potential federal False Claims Act liability. Additionally, many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and do not contain identical safe harbors. These and any new regulations or requirements may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with, may adversely impact the marketing of our existing products or delay introduction of our products, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Adzenys XR-ODT and Cotempla XR-ODT contain controlled substances, and their manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation, prescribing and distribution are subject to regulation by the DEA. Adzenys XR-ODT and Cotempla XR-ODT, (collectively, our Controlled Substance Products ), which are approved by the FDA, are regulated by the DEA as Schedule II controlled substances. Before any commercialization of any product candidate that contains a controlled substance, the DEA determines the controlled substance schedule of a

 drug, taking into account the recommendation of the FDA. Our Controlled Substance Products are, and our other future products may, if approved, be regulated as controlled substances as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, and the implementing regulations of the DEA, which establish registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution, importation, exportation, inventory, quota and other requirements administered by the DEA. These requirements are applicable to us, to our third-party manufacturers and to distributors, prescribers, and dispensers of our products. For example, Schedule II controlled substances are subject to various restrictions, including, but not limited to, mandatory written prescriptions and the prohibition of refills. The DEA regulates the handling of controlled substances through a closed chain of distribution. This control extends to the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce. A number of states and foreign countries also independently regulate these drugs as controlled substances. State-controlled substance laws and regulations may have more extensive requirements than those determined by the DEA and FDA. Though state-controlled substances laws often mirror federal law because the states are separate jurisdictions, they may schedule products separately. While some states automatically schedule a drug when the DEA does so, other states require additional state rulemaking or legislative action, which could delay commercialization. Some state and local governments also require manufacturers to operate a drug stewardship program that collects, secures, transports, and safely disposes of unwanted drugs. The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use, and may not be marketed or sold in the U.S. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances are considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Amphetamine and methylphenidate, which are the active ingredients in our Adzenys XR-ODT and Cotempla XR-ODT products, respectively, are listed by the DEA as a Schedule II controlled substance under the CSA. Scheduled controlled substances are subject to DEA regulations relating to supply, procurement, manufacturing, storage, distribution, and physician prescription procedures. We currently manufacture these products in our own facilities, which are registered with and inspected by the DEA. Our planned contract manufacturer is also registered with and inspected by the DEA. Registered entities are subject to DEA inspection and also must follow specific labeling and packaging requirements, and provide appropriate security measures to control against diversion of controlled substances. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II controlled substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as vaults and inventory reconciliations. Failure to follow these requirements can lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and possibly even lead to a revocation of a DEA registration. The DEA also has a production and procurement quota system that controls and limits the availability and production of Schedule I or II controlled substances. If we or any of our suppliers of raw materials that are DEA classified as Schedule I or II controlled substances are unable to receive any quota or a sufficient quota to meet demand for our products, if any, our business would be negatively impacted. Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. Because of their restrictive nature, these laws and regulations could limit commercialization of our products containing controlled substances. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could also result in withdrawal of our DEA registrations, disruption in manufacturing and distribution activities, consent decrees, criminal and civil penalties, and state actions, among other consequences. The design, development, manufacture, supply and distribution of our products are highly regulated processes and technically complex. We are subject to extensive regulation of the preparation and manufacture of our products for commercial sale. Components of a finished therapeutic product approved for commercial sale or used in late stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMPs and equivalent foreign standards. These regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures, including record keeping, and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale. Poor control of production processes 
 40 

Table of Contents 
 can lead to the introduction of adventitious agents or other contaminants, or to inadvertent changes in the properties or stability of our products that may not be detectable in final product testing. The development, manufacture, supply, and distribution of our approved products as well as any of our future potential products, are highly regulated processes and technically complex. We, along with our third-party suppliers, must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements of the FDA and foreign authorities. For instance, because each of our ADHD products is a regulated drug product and subject to the DEA and state-level regulations, we have had to, and will continue to, need to secure state licenses from each required state in which we intend to sell such product allowing us to distribute a regulated drug product in such state. Regulatory authorities also may audit our manufacturing facilities. If any such inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulations occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, we may be required to take remedial measures that may be costly and/or time consuming for us to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of commercial sales or the temporary or permanent closure of our facility. Any such remedial measures imposed upon us could materially harm our business. If we fail to maintain regulatory compliance, the FDA can impose regulatory sanctions including, among other things, refusal to approve a pending application for a new drug product or revocation of a pre-existing approval, or civil or criminal penalties. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed. There is a risk we may be unable to sell and distribute certain of our products if we cannot continue to comply with the serialization requirements of the Drug Quality and Security Act within the necessary time frames. Title II of the Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 provided increased FDA oversight over tracking and monitoring of the sale and distribution of prescription drugs. We are required to provide product identification information, or serialization, at the manufacturing batch, or lot level. In addition, we are required to track and verify wholesaler and pharmacy authentication and verification. By the end of 2023 we will be required to conduct unit level tracking throughout the entire supply chain. We are now serializing our products and are compliant with the Drug Quality and Security Act, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to continue to satisfy each ever-stringent product identification requirements. Failing to do so could result in a delay or inability to sell our products within the United States. Failure to comply with health and data protection laws and regulations could lead to U.S. federal and state government enforcement actions, including civil or criminal penalties, private litigation, and adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. We and any potential collaborators may be subject to U.S. federal and state data protection laws and regulations, such as laws and regulations that address privacy and data security. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties, including research institutions which are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA, as amended by Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health HITECH ). To the extent that we act as a business associate to a healthcare provider engaging in electronic transactions, we may also be subject to the privacy and security provisions of HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, which restricts the use and disclosure of patient-identifiable health information, mandates the adoption of standards relating to the privacy and security of patient-identifiable health information, and requires the reporting of certain security breaches to healthcare provider customers, the federal government, and media outlets with respect to such information. Additionally, many states have enacted similar laws that may impose more stringent requirements on entities like ours. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we could be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties if we obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. Compliance with U.S. and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to collect, use and disclose data, or in some cases, impact our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in 
 41 

Table of Contents 
 government enforcement actions (which could include civil, criminal, and administrative penalties), private litigation, and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. Moreover, employees and other individuals about whom we or our potential collaborators obtain personal information, as well as the providers who share this information with us, may limit our ability to collect, use and disclose the information. Claims that we have violated individuals privacy rights, failed to comply with data protection laws, or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business. We may use hazardous chemicals and biological materials in our business. Any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time-consuming and costly. Our research and development processes may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological materials. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. We may be sued for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials, and our liability may exceed any insurance coverage and our total assets. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials and specified waste products, as well as the discharge of pollutants into the environment and human health and safety matters. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive and may impair our research and development efforts. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur substantial costs, including civil or criminal fines and penalties, clean-up costs or capital expenditures for control equipment or operational changes necessary to achieve and maintain compliance. In addition, we cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended environmental laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted and enforced. RISKS RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY We are dependent on our relationships and license agreements, and we rely on the intellectual property rights granted to us pursuant to the license agreements. A number of our patent and trademark rights are derived from our license agreements with third parties. Pursuant to these license agreements, we have licensed rights to various patents, patent applications, trademarks and trademark applications within and outside of the United States. We may lose our rights to this intellectual property if we breach our obligations under such license agreements, including, without limitation, our financial obligations to the licensors. If we violate or fail to perform any term or covenant of the license agreements, the licensors may terminate the license agreements upon satisfaction of applicable notice requirements and expiration of any applicable cure periods. Additionally, any termination of license agreements, whether by us or the licensors may not relieve us of our obligation to pay any license fees owing at the time of such termination. If we fail to retain our rights under these license agreements, we will not be able to commercialize certain products subject to patent or patent application or trademark or trademark application, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects would be materially adversely affected. In addition, the licensor may not be able to obtain valid and enforceable patents that protect the licensed products and may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing on those rights. From time to time we may renegotiate the terms of our existing licensing agreements or other material contracts. There can be no guarantee that the terms of the renegotiated license agreement will be viewed favorably by the market although the renegotiated terms might be advantageous to our business or that the other party would agree to material changes to benefit the Company. For example, in May 2022, we negotiated to terminate the License, Development, Manufacturing and Supply agreement with Tris. The negotiations resulted in reducing the future minimum payments we owed to Tris by approximately 8 million. If we were unable to renegotiate the terms of the agreement, it would have had a material negative impact on our cash flows and financial position.

 The expiration or loss of patent protection may adversely affect our future revenues and operating results. The suite of composition-of-matter patents for Adzenys XR-ODT are scheduled to expire in 2026 and 2032. The composition-of-matter patents in the U.S. for Cotempla XR-ODT expire in 2032, and the method-of-use patent expires in 2038. There is no guarantee that we will be able to extend the life of these patents or to obtain additional patents, licenses, or other instruments that can provide us with a comparable level of exclusivity to the intellectual property underlying the expiring patents. We rely on patent, trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of our products. In particular, patent protection is, in the aggregate, important in our marketing of products in the United States. Patents covering our products normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the profitability of many of our products. As patents for certain of our products expire, we may face competition from lower priced generic or bioequivalent products. In general, the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product may allow market entry by substitute products that could significantly reduce sales for the original product in a short amount of time. If our competitive position is compromised because of generic or bioequivalent products or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic or bioequivalent products. Any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the negative effect of generic competition. Our ability to compete may decline if we do not adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights. Our success depends in part on our ability to manufacture, use, sell and offer to sell our products and in obtaining and maintaining intellectual property rights in our products, proprietary know-how and technology advances. We rely on patent protection, as well as a combination of trademark and trade secret laws to protect and prevent others from making, using and/or selling our compounds, processes, apparatuses and technology. While a presumption of validity exists with respect to patents issued to us in the U.S., there can be no assurance that any of our patents will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. Such means may afford only limited protection of our intellectual property and may not (i) prevent our competitors from duplicating our inventions; (ii) prevent our competitors from gaining access to our proprietary information and technology; or (iii) permit us to gain or maintain a competitive advantage. In addition, our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully practice, produce or sell our products in a competitive manner. Obtaining and maintaining a patent portfolio entails significant expense and resources. We may or may not choose to pursue or maintain protection for particular inventions. In addition, there are situations in which failure to make certain payments or noncompliance with certain requirements in the patent process can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we choose to forgo patent protection or allow a patent application or patent to lapse purposefully or inadvertently, our competitive position could suffer. In addition, the patent scope can be limited in prosecution or by the courts after issuance. In addition, we may face claims by third parties that our agreements with employees, contractors, or consultants obligating them to assign intellectual property to us are ineffective, or in conflict with prior or competing contractual obligations of assignment, which could result in ownership disputes. Litigation may be necessary to resolve an ownership dispute, and if we are not successful, we may be precluded from using certain intellectual property, or may lose our exclusive rights in that intellectual property. Either outcome could have an adverse impact on our business. Legal actions to enforce our patent rights and administrative challenges at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office can be expensive and may involve the diversion of significant management time. In addition, these actions could be unsuccessful and could also result in the invalidation of our patents or a finding that they are unenforceable. We may or may not choose to pursue litigation or other actions against those that have infringed on our patents, or used them without authorization, due to the associated expense and time commitment of monitoring these activities. If we fail to protect or to enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

 If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed. In addition to patent protection, because we operate in the highly technical field of development of therapies and medical devices, we rely in part on trade secret protection in order to protect our proprietary technology and processes. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We expect to enter into confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific and commercial collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors. These agreements generally require that the other party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties all confidential information developed by the party or made known to the party by us during the course of the party s relationship with us. These agreements also generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property. However, these agreements may not be honored and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us. In addition to contractual measures, we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using physical and technological security measures. Such measures may not, for example, in the case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee or third party with authorized access, provide adequate protection for our proprietary information. Our security measures may not prevent an employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor, and recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the U.S. may be less willing to protect trade secrets. Trade secrets may be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. If any of our confidential or proprietary information, such as our trade secrets, were to be disclosed or misappropriated, or if any such information was independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position could be harmed. We may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to pharmaceuticals and medical devices. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of some of our patents, if obtained, or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. In addition, some countries allow patents to be challenged by third parties in administrative proceedings, which may result in a reduction in scope or cancelation of some or all of the claims. Patent protection must ultimately be sought on a country-by-country basis, which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the U.S. and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of intellectual property. A dispute concerning the infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others could be time consuming and costly, and an unfavorable outcome could harm our business. There is significant litigation in the pharmaceutical industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. While we are not currently subject to any pending intellectual property litigation, and are not aware of any such threatened litigation, we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our products infringe 
 44 

Table of Contents 
 the intellectual property rights of others. If our development and commercialization activities are found to infringe any such patents, we may have to pay significant damages or seek licenses to such patents. A patentee could prevent us from using the patented drugs, compositions or devices that relate to our prescription and consumer health business. We may need to resort to litigation to enforce a patent issued to us, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. From time to time, we may hire scientific personnel or consultants formerly employed by other companies or universities involved in one or more areas similar to the activities conducted by us. Either we or these individuals may be subject to allegations of trade secret misappropriation, wrongful disclosure of confidential information, or other similar claims as a result of prior affiliations. If we become involved in litigation, it could consume a substantial portion of our managerial and financial resources, regardless of whether we win or lose. We may not be able to afford the costs of litigation. Any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in defending ourselves against these claims could have a material adverse impact on our cash position and stock price. Any legal action against us or our collaborators could lead to: payment of damages, potentially treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party s intellectual property rights; injunctive or other equitable relief that may effectively block our ability to further develop, commercialize, and sell products; or we or our collaborators having to enter into license arrangements that may not be available on commercially reasonable or acceptable terms, if at all, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our cash position and business, prospects and financial condition. As a result, we could be prevented from commercializing our products. RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION, STRUCTURE AND OPERATION Our efforts to expand and transform our businesses may require significant investments; if our strategies are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. We continuously evaluate opportunities for expansion and change. These initiatives may involve making acquisitions, entering into partnerships and joint ventures, divesting assets, restructuring our existing operations and assets, creating new financial structures and building new facilities any of which could require a significant investment and subject us to new kinds of risks. We may incur additional indebtedness to finance these opportunities. If our strategies for growth and change are not successful, we could face increased financial pressure, such as increased cash flow demands, reduced liquidity and diminished access to financial markets, and the equity value of our businesses could be diluted. The implementation of strategies for growth and change may create additional risks, including: diversion of management time and attention away from existing operations; requiring capital investment that could otherwise be used for the operation and growth of our existing businesses; disruptions to important business relationships; increased operating costs; limitations imposed by various governmental entities; and difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new markets we may enter. 
 45 

Table of Contents 
 Our inability to mitigate these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our strategies for growth and change could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may fail to fully achieve the savings or growth projected for current or future initiatives notwithstanding the expenditure of substantial resources in pursuit thereof. We may have difficulties integrating acquired products and businesses and as a result, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. We have completed a number of acquisitions, and we intend to continue to acquire additional products and businesses through mergers, asset purchases or in-licensing, businesses or products, or form strategic alliances as part of our business strategy. Such growth strategies involve risks, including: inability to efficiently operate new businesses or to integrate acquired products and businesses; inability to accurately predict delays in realizing the costs and benefits of acquisitions, partnerships, or joint ventures; unexpected losses of customers or suppliers of an acquired or existing business; difficulties in retaining key employees of acquired businesses; difficulties in realizing projected synergies; failure of the acquired business to produce the expected value; exposure to unanticipated liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures, litigation challenging a merger, product liability or illegal activities conducted by an acquired company or a joint venture partner. Our inability to address these risks in a timely manner or at all could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In fiscal 2023, the great majority of our gross revenue and gross accounts receivable were due to three significant customers, the loss of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Three customers contributed greater than 10 of our gross revenue during the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. During the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, three customers accounted for 78 of gross revenue, respectively. The loss of one or more of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. Any reduction, delay or cancellation of an order from these customers or the loss of any of these customers could cause our revenue to decline. If we are unable to diversify our customer base, we will continue to be susceptible to risks associated with customer concentration. Our accounts receivable subjects us to credit risk. We are also subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales. As of June 30, 2023, three customers accounted for 83 of gross accounts receivable. Our profitability and cash flow are dependent on receipt of timely payments from customers. Any delay in payment by our customers may have an adverse effect on our profitability, working capital and cash flow. There is no assurance that we will be able to collect all or any of its trade receivables in a timely matter. If any of our customers face unexpected situations such as financial difficulties, we may not be able to receive full or any payment of the uncollected sums or enforce any judgment debts against such clients, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.

 We depend on key personnel and attracting qualified management personnel and our business could be harmed if we lose personnel and cannot attract new personnel. Our success depends to a significant degree upon the technical and management skills of our directors, officers, and key personnel. Any of our directors could resign from our board at any time and for any reason. Although our named executive officers Joshua Disbrow and Mark Oki have employment agreements, the existence of an employment agreement does not guarantee the retention of the executive officer for any period of time, and each agreement obligates us to pay the officer lump sum severance of two and a half years and one year, respectively, of salary if we terminate him without cause, as defined in the agreement, which could hurt our liquidity. The loss of the services of either of these individuals would likely have a material adverse effect on us. Our success also will depend upon our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management, marketing, technical, and sales executives and personnel. We do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our officers or key personnel. The loss of any of our directors or key executives, or the failure to attract, integrate, motivate, and retain additional key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. We compete for such personnel, including directors, against numerous companies, including larger, more established companies with significantly greater financial resources than we possess. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. Product liability and other lawsuits could divert our resources, result in substantial liabilities and reduce the commercial potential of our products. We will be exposed to potential product liability and professional indemnity risks that are inherent in the research, development, manufacturing, marketing, and use of therapeutic candidates. Any failure of future therapeutic candidates by us and our corporate collaborators may expose us to liability claims as may the potential sale of any therapies approved in the future. These claims might be made by patients who use our therapies, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, our corporate collaborators or other third parties that research or sell our therapies. Any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could be difficult and costly to defend and could materially adversely affect the market for our future therapeutic candidates or any prospects for commercialization of our future therapeutic candidates. The risk that we may be sued on product liability claims is inherent in the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical, medical device, dietary supplement and personal care products. Side effects of, or manufacturing defects in, products that we develop and commercialized could result in the deterioration of a patient s condition, injury or even death. Once a product is approved for sale and commercialized, the likelihood of product liability lawsuits increases. Claims may be brought by individuals seeking relief for themselves or by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. These lawsuits may divert our management from pursuing our business strategy and may be costly to defend. In addition, if we are held liable in any of these lawsuits, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be forced to limit or forgo further commercialization of the affected products. We may be subject to legal or administrative proceedings and litigation other than product liability lawsuits which may be costly to defend and could materially harm our business, financial condition and operations. Although we maintain general liability and product liability insurance, this insurance may not fully cover potential liabilities. In addition, insurance coverage is increasingly expensive and difficult to obtain. For example, we have experienced increasing difficulty in procuring insurance coverage for our products, in particular, our ADHD products, due to their status as controlled substances. Inability to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product or other legal or administrative liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercial production and sale of any of our products that receive regulatory approval, which could adversely affect our business. Product liability claims could also harm our reputation, which may adversely affect our collaborators ability to commercialize our products successfully. A successful product liability claim or series of 
 47 

Table of Contents 
 claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business. Claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to the Company. Our certificate of incorporation provides that we will indemnify our directors to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. In addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our bylaws provide that: we may, in our discretion, indemnify other officers, employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law; we are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and executive officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or executive officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification; we will not be obligated pursuant to our bylaws to indemnify any director or executive officer in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless (i) such indemnification is expressly required to be made by law, (ii) the proceeding was authorized by our Board of Directors, (iii) such indemnification is provided by us, in our sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the corporation under applicable law or (iv) such indemnification is required to be made pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws; the rights conferred in our bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons; and we may not retroactively amend our bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees and agents. As a result, if we are required to indemnify one or more of our directors or executive officers, it may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us, may reduce the amount of money available to us and may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Public concern over the abuse of medications that are controlled substances, including increased legislative, legal and regulatory action, could negatively affect our business. Products containing controlled substances may generate public controversy. Certain governmental and regulatory agencies, as well as state and local jurisdictions, are focused on the abuse of controlled substances such as opioids in the United States. State and local governmental agencies have commenced investigations into pharmaceutical companies and others in the supply chain in connection with the distribution of opioid medications. For example, on March 7, 2018 and April 18, 2019, Neos Therapeutics, which we now own, received citations advising Neos that the County of Harris Texas and the County of Walker Texas filed lawsuits on December 13, 2017 and January 11, 2019, respectively, against Neos and various other alleged manufacturers, promoters, sellers and distributors of opioid pharmaceutical products. Through these lawsuits, each of Harris County and Walker County seek to recoup as damages some of the expenses they allegedly have incurred to combat opioid use and addiction. Each of Harris County and Walker County also seeks punitive damages, disgorgement of profits and attorneys fees. In addition, multiple lawsuits have been filed against pharmaceutical companies alleging, among other claims, failures to provide effective controls and procedures to guard against the diversion of controlled substances, negligence by distributing controlled substances to pharmacies that serve individuals who abuse controlled substances, and failures to report suspicious orders of controlled substances in accordance with regulations. Certain cases noted above have recently been settled, some for hundreds of millions of dollars. In the future, political pressures and adverse publicity could lead to delays in, and increased expenses for, and limit or restrict, the introduction and marketing of our products, the withdrawal of currently approved products from the market, or result in other legal action. 
 48 

Table of Contents 
 In addition, we are aware of other legislative, regulatory or industry measures to address the misuse of prescription opioid medications which could affect our business in ways that we may not be able to predict. Liabilities for taxes or assessments under any such laws will likely have an adverse impact on our results of operations, unless we are able to mitigate them through operational changes or commercial arrangements where permitted and may result in us ceasing to continue to sell our products in these jurisdictions. Certain of our stockholders own a significant percentage of our stock and may and their interests may conflict with yours. As of June 30, 2023, one stockholder holds approximately 20 of our outstanding common stock and holds warrants which can be exercised to purchase additional shares of our common stock resulting in ownership of approximately 40 of our currently outstanding common stock. Accordingly, this stockholder will be able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and over matters requiring security holder approval. In addition, in connection with our recent public offering of securities in June 2023, this stockholder has been granted the right to designate an individual to join our board of directors, who has since joined the board of directors, and to nominate an additional candidate who is acceptable to us to be elected to the Board, subject to Nasdaq regulations. The interests of this stockholder could conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. Our business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders. Proxy contests have been waged against many companies in the pharmaceutical industry over the last several years. It is possible that one or more of our stockholders may publicly voice opposition to certain aspects of our corporate governance and strategy, or undertake a proxy contest to reconstitute our board. If faced with a proxy contest or other type of stockholder activism, we may not be able to respond successfully to the contest or other type of activism which would be disruptive to our business. Even if we are successful, our reputation and/or business could be adversely affected by a proxy contest or other form of stockholder activism because: responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting operations and diverting the attention of management and employees; perceived uncertainties as to our company and future strategic direction may result in the loss of potential financing, acquisitions, collaboration, in-licensing or other business opportunities, and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners; and if individuals are elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plan and create additional value for our stockholders. Any or all of these activities could cause our stock price to decline or experience periods of volatility, and could be particularly problematic as our company seeks to transition to a commercial enterprise in a challenging environment. RISK RELATED TO SECURITIES MARKETS AND INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES Our failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, the exchange may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting notification, we anticipate that we would take actions to restore our compliance with applicable exchange requirements, such as stabilize our market price, improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below such exchange s minimum bid price requirement, or prevent future non-compliance with such exchange s listing requirements.

 Effecting a reverse stock split, if determined by the Board in its discretion, may not achieve one or more of our objectives. We have effected five reverse stock splits since June 8, 2015, each of which has impacted the trading liquidity of the shares of our common stock. There can be no assurance that the market price per share of our common stock after a reverse stock split will remain unchanged or increase in proportion to the reduction in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding before the reverse stock split. The market price of our shares may fluctuate and potentially decline after a reverse stock split. Accordingly, the total market capitalization of our common stock after a reverse stock split may be lower than the total market capitalization before the reverse stock split. Moreover, the market price of our common stock following a reverse stock split may not exceed or remain higher than the market price prior to the reverse stock split. Additionally, there can be no assurance that a reverse stock split will result in a per-share market price that will attract institutional investors or investment funds or that such share price will satisfy investing guidelines of institutional investors or investment funds. As a result, the trading liquidity of our common stock may not necessarily improve. Further, if a reverse stock split is effected and the market price of our common stock declines, the percentage decline may be greater than would occur in the absence of a reverse stock split. Our share price is volatile and may be influenced by numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control. The trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this prospectus, these factors include: the success of products we acquire for development or commercialization relative to the success of our competitors; product safety; conditions or trends in the healthcare, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including healthcare payment systems; our ability to effectively manage operations, financial decisions, internal controls over financial reporting or disclosure controls, performance relative to projections, and attract and retain employees; our dependence on third parties, including CROs and scientific and medical advisors; adverse regulatory decisions or changes in laws or regulations; disputes or other developments relating to patents and other proprietary rights and our ability to obtain patent protection for our products; general political and economic conditions and effects of natural or man-made catastrophic events; and other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, the stock market in general, and the stocks of small-cap healthcare, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in these Risk Factors, could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. You might not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.

 If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and any trading volume could decline. Any trading market for our common stock that may develop will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We cannot control the number of securities and industry analysts who publish research on us, the extent of their coverage or the content of their reports. Downgrades of our stock or publishing inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, would likely lead to a decline in our stock price. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose market visibility and demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and any trading volume to decline. Some provisions of our charter documents and applicable Delaware law may discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if the acquisition may be beneficial to some of our stockholders. Provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, as well as certain provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if doing so may benefit some of our stockholders. These provisions include: the authorization of 50.0 million shares of blank check preferred stock, the rights, preferences and privileges of which may be established and shares of which may be issued by our Board of Directors at its discretion from time to time and without stockholder approval; limiting the removal of directors by the stockholders; allowing for the creation of a staggered board of directors; eliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings. These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by the board of directors. This provision could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing someone from acquiring us or merging with us, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Any provision of our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or of Delaware law that is applicable to us that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock in the event that a potentially beneficial acquisition is discouraged, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. We do not intend to pay cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future. We have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends in the future would depend on our financial condition, contractual restrictions, solvency tests imposed by applicable corporate laws, results of operations, anticipated cash requirements and other factors and will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Our stockholders should not expect that we will ever pay cash or other dividends on our outstanding capital stock.

 We are and may continue to be subject to short selling strategies. Short sellers of our stock may be manipulative and may attempt to drive down the market price of shares of our Common Stock. Short selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is therefore in the short seller s best interests for the price of the stock to decline, many short sellers (sometime known as disclosed shorts publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a stock short. Although traditionally these disclosed shorts were limited in their ability to access mainstream business media or to otherwise create negative market rumors, the rise of the Internet and technological advancements regarding document creation, videotaping and publication by blogging have allowed many disclosed shorts to publicly attack a company s credibility, strategy and veracity by means of so-called research reports that mimic the type of investment analysis performed by large Wall Street firms and independent research analysts. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in the market, on occasion in large scale and broad base. Issuers who have limited trading volumes and are susceptible to higher volatility levels than large-cap stocks, can be particularly vulnerable to such short seller attacks. These short seller publications are not regulated by any governmental, self-regulatory organization or other official authority in the United States, are not subject to certification requirements imposed by the SEC and, accordingly, the opinions they express may be based on distortions or omissions of actual facts or, in some cases, fabrications of facts. In light of the limited risks involved in publishing such information, and the enormous profit that can be made from running a successful short attack, unless the short sellers become subject to significant penalties, it is more likely than not that disclosed short sellers will continue to issue such reports. Significant short selling of a company s stock creates an incentive for market participants to reduce the value of that company s common stock. Short selling may lead to the placement of sell orders by short sellers without commensurate buy orders because the shares borrowed by short sellers do not have to be returned by any fixed period of time. If a significant market for short selling our common stock develops, the market price of our common stock could be significantly depressed. The Sabby litigation may result in the issuance of additional shares on the exercise of certain of our warrants and cause dilution to existing shareholders. A complaint was filed on February 22, 2023 by holders of certain warrants to purchase common stock, against the Company. The complaint alleges that the Company improperly adjusted the exercise price of the warrants and miscalculated the number of shares the warrantholders may receive, and that the Company failed to provide prompt notice to the warrantholders of such adjustment. The complaint seeks, among other things, a declaratory judgment of the warrant share calculation such that 2,325,581 warrant shares be due to the warrantholders on the exercise of the warrants rather than 1,265,547 shares. While we believe that this lawsuit is without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against it, we are not able to predict at this time whether this proceeding will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. If this lawsuit is successful and the warrantholders exercise their warrants, it will result in significant dilution of the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall. See Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings for more information on this lawsuit. GENERAL RISK FACTORS Our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures, cybersecurity attacks or other security breaches. We utilize information technology, or IT, systems and networks to process, transmit and store electronic information in connection with our business activities. As use of digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate cybersecurity attacks and attempts to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and networks, have increased in frequency and sophistication. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and

Table of Contents 
 the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing cyber attacks or successfully mitigating their effects. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from such cybersecurity attacks, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, ransomware attacks, phishing expeditions, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such an event could cause interruption of our operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could suffer reputational harm or face litigation or adverse regulatory action and the development of our products could be delayed. Our sales force and other employees, third party logistics partners, CMOs, CROs, principal investigators, collaborators, independent contractors, consultants and other vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements. Major bank failure or sustained financial market illiquidity, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We face certain risks in the event of a sustained deterioration of domestic or international financial market liquidity. In particular: We may be unable to access funds in our deposit accounts on a timely basis. Any resulting need to access other sources of liquidity or short-term borrowing would increase our costs. In the event of a major bank failure, we could face major risks to the recovery of our bank deposits. A substantial portion of our cash and cash equivalents are either held at banks that are not subject to insurance protection against loss or exceed the deposit insurance limit. While we are not currently aware of any liquidity issues directly impacting the financial institutions where we hold cash deposits or securities, if financial liquidity deteriorates, there can be no assurance we will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access capital and on our business, financial condition and results of operations. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES We lease or sublease various properties, including office buildings, manufacturing, research and development facilities and sales offices within the U.S. We continuously review and evaluate our facilities as a part of our strategy to optimize our business operations. The following table sets forth a list of our properties as of June 30, 2023.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Witmer Class-Action Securities Litigation. A shareholder derivative suit was filed on September 12, 2022 in the Delaware Chancery Court by Paul Witmer, derivatively and on behalf of all Aytu stockholders, against Armistice Capital, LLC, Armistice Capital Master Fund, Ltd., Steve Boyd (Armistice s Chief Investment Officer and Managing Partner, and a former director of Aytu), and certain other current and former directors of Aytu, Joshua Disbrow, Gary

 Cantrell, John Donofrio, Jr., Michael Macaluso, Carl Dockery and Ketan B. Mehta. Plaintiff amended the complaint on April 5, 2023. The Amended Complaint drops Mr. Macaluso as a defendant and alleges that (i) Armistice facilitated the sale of assets of Cerecor in 2019 and Innovus in 2020 to Aytu in exchange for convertible securities which it subsequently converted and sold at a profit on the open market; (ii) the Armistice defendants breached their fiduciary duties, were unjustly enrichment and wasted corporate assets in connection with these acquisitions; (iii) the Armistice defendants breached their fiduciary duties by engaging in as insider trading; and (iv) the other directors breached their fiduciary duties, and aided and abetted the Armistice defendants breaches of fiduciary duties, in connection with these acquisitions. The Amended Complaint seeks unspecified damages, equitable relief, restitution, disgorgement of profits, enhanced governance and internal procedures, and attorneys fees. While we believe that this lawsuit is without merit and have vigorously defended against it, we have agreed to settle the matter for various corporate governance modifications and the payment of plaintiff s attorneys fees. Sabby Litigation. A complaint was filed on February 22, 2023 in the Supreme Court of the State of New York by Sabby Volatility Warrant Master Fund LTD Sabby and Walleye Opportunities Master Fund Ltd Walleye ), holders of certain warrants to purchase common stock, against the Company. The complaint alleges that the Company improperly adjusted the exercise price of the warrants and miscalculated the number of shares the warrantholders may receive, and that the Company failed to provide prompt notice to the warrantholders of such adjustment. The complaint seeks a declaratory judgment of the warrant share calculation, that 575,000 warrant shares be due to Sabby on exercise of its warrants rather than 312,908 shares, and that 100,000 warrant shares be due to Walleye on exercise of its warrants rather than 54,146 shares. While we believe that this lawsuit is without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against it, we are not able to predict at this time whether this proceeding will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Stein Litigation. Cielo Stein Stein ), a former sales specialist, filed a complaint on February 1, 2023 in Jefferson County Circuit Court in Kentucky against the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary Neos Therapeutics. The complaint alleges that Aytu retaliated against Stein in violation of the Kentucky Civil Rights Act after she opposed what she contends was unwelcome behavior by her supervisor. The complaint also alleges that the Company s response to Stein s subsequent complaint to human resources was inadequate. The complaint seeks an award of unspecified compensatory damages, emotional-distress damages, and attorneys fees and costs. The Company removed the lawsuit to the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky and filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which is pending. Due to the early stage of litigation, we are not able to predict at this time whether this proceeding will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations, and intend to vigorously defend this case in the event it is not dismissed. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable.

 Equity Compensation Plan Information On May 18, 2023, our stockholders approved the adoption of the Aytu BioPharma, Inc. 2023 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan ). Prior to our adoption of the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan, we awarded equity incentive grants to our directors and employees under the Aytu BioScience, Inc. 2015 Stock Option and Incentive Plan Aytu 2015 Plan and the Neos Therapeutics, Inc. 2015 Stock Options and Incentive Plan the Neos 2015 Plan (collectively the 2015 Plans ). For the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan, the stockholders approved (a) 200,000 new shares, (b) 87,155 shares available for grant under the 2015 Plans be rolled over to the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan and (c) any shares that are returned to the company under the 2015 Plans be added to the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan. The following table displays equity compensation plan information as of June 30, 2023 relating to securities reserved for future issuance upon exercise.

 Dividend Policy We have never declared or paid any dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings, if any, to fund the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors. Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is limited by restrictions under the terms of our credit facility with Avenue Capital. In addition, any future indebtedness that we may incur could preclude us from paying dividends. Investors should not purchase our common stock with the expectation of receiving cash dividends.

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing strategy, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the Risk Factors section of this Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. OBJECTIVE The purpose of the Management Discussion and Analysis (the MD A is to present information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 and our financial condition as of June 30, 2023. The MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and notes. OVERVIEW We are a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company focused on commercializing novel therapeutics and consumer healthcare products. We operate through two business segments (i) the Rx Segment, consisting of various prescription pharmaceutical products sold through third party wholesalers (the Rx Portfolio ), and (ii) the Consumer Health Segment, which consists of various consumer health products sold directly to consumers. We generate revenue by selling our products through third party intermediaries in our marketing channels as well as directly to our customers. We currently manufacture our products for the treatment of ADHD at our manufacturing facility in Grand Prairie, Texas and use third party manufacturers for our other prescription and consumer health products. We also have a product candidate in development, AR101 (enzastaurin) for the treatment of VEDS, for which the development has been indefinitely suspended. We have incurred significant losses in each year since inception. Our net losses were 17.1 million and 108.8 million for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 304.1 million and 287.1 million, respectively. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses in connection with our ongoing activities, including the integration of our acquisitions and the commercialization of our product pipeline. SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS Business Environment We have continued to experience significant inflationary pressure and supply chain disruptions related to the sourcing of raw materials, energy, logistics and labor during fiscal 2023. While we do not have sales or operations in Russia or Ukraine, it is possible that the conflict or actions taken in response, could adversely affect some of our markets and suppliers, economic and financial markets, costs and availability of energy and materials, or cause further supply chain disruptions. We expect that inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions could continue to be significant across the business throughout the year. Commercial Products On March 23, 2022, our newly issued US patent No. 11,166,947 for Cotempla XR-ODT was listed in the U.S. FDA publication Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations , commonly known as the Orange Book. The Cotempla XR-ODT patent covers methods of use for the effective pediatric dosing of methylphenidate for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The Orange Book listing extends the exclusivity period for Cotempla XR-ODT to 2038. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. has the right to manufacture and 
 57 

Table of Contents 
 market its generic version of Cotempla XR-ODT under its ANDA beginning on July 1, 2026, or earlier under certain circumstances. Development Products AR101 On December 7, 2021, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation ODD to AR101 for the treatment of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a group of rare inherited connective tissue disorders that includes the severe subtype VEDS. The FDA grants ODD status to drugs and biologics that are intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases, or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. ODD affords us with certain financial incentives to support clinical development and the potential for up to seven years of market exclusivity in the U.S. upon regulatory approval. On December 13, 2021, the FDA cleared the IND application for AR101 in VEDS to enable the initiation of the AR101 PREVEnt Trial in VEDS. On March 2, 2022, the European Commission granted orphan designation to AR101 (enzastaurin) for the treatment of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. The European Medicines Agency orphan designation affords us with certain benefits and incentives, including clinical protocol assistance, differentiated evaluation procedures for Health Technology Assessments in certain countries, access to a centralized marketing authorization procedure valid in all EU member states, reduced regulatory fees and 10 years of market exclusivity. On April 19, 2022, we were notified by the FDA that AR101 received Fast Track designation. Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. Fast Track addresses a broad range of serious conditions, and the request can be initiated by a pharmaceutical company at any time during the development process. FDA reviews the request and decides based on whether or not the drug fills an unmet medical need in a serious condition. Once a drug receives Fast Track designation, early and frequent communication between the FDA and the sponsor is encouraged throughout the entire drug development and review process. In October 2022, we announced the indefinite suspension of the development of AR101 to focus on our commercial operations. Healight In November 2021, we received U.S. Patent Number 11,179,575, titled Internal Ultraviolet Therapy, which is the first issued patent protecting the Healight investigational device and covers methods of treating a patient for an infectious condition inside the patient s body through the insertion of a UV-light-emitting delivery tube inside a respiratory cavity of the patient at specific UV-A light wavelengths. The term of this patent extends to August of 2040. In April 2022, our preclinical pilot study showed that administration of Healight delayed the time to development of VAP in a novel porcine model. The proof-of-concept study was conducted at Hospital Clinic de Barcelona under the supervision of principal investigator Antonio Torres, M.D., Ph.D., FERS, FCCP, ATSF, Senior Consultant, Pulmonology Department - one of the only centers in the world with access to this well-characterized porcine model of VAP caused by oropharyngeal secretions colonized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In the study, administration of the Healight UV-A endotracheal catheter resulted in a 46 reduction in multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA C1-17 versus controls following two separate 20-minute treatments. Based on these positive data, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona and we conducted a second, larger porcine VAP study to guide the future development of Healight for patients with VAP. We have since terminated the license agreement with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center CSMC and have discontinued development of Healight.

 Debt and Equity Financings On January 26, 2022, we entered into the Avenue Capital Agreement with the Avenue Capital, pursuant to which Avenue Capital provided the Company and certain of its subsidiaries with a secured 15.0 million loan. The interest rate on the loan is the greater of the prime rate and 3.25 , plus 7.4 , payable monthly in arrears. The maturity date of the loan is January 26, 2025. The proceeds from the Avenue Capital Agreement were used towards the repayment of the Deerfield Facility , which was otherwise due and payable on May 11, 2022. In connection with the Avenue Capital Agreement, we entered into an amendment to the Eclipse Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the amendment, the Company, among other things, extended the maturity date of the Eclipse Loan Agreement to January 26, 2025 and reduced the maximum availability under the Eclipse Loan Agreement from 25.0 million to 12.5 million minus a 3.5 million availability block. On March 24, 2023, we entered into an Amendment No. 4 (the Eclipse Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement dated October 2, 2019. The Eclipse Amendment, among other things, provided for an aggregate increase of 2.0 million to the Eclipse Lender s commitment to make revolving loans from time to time under the Eclipse Agreement and increased the maximum amount available under the revolving credit facility provided under the Eclipse Agreement to 14.5 million. The ability to make borrowings and obtain advances of revolving loans under the Eclipse Agreement remains subject to a borrowing base and reserve, and availability blockage requirements. On March 7, 2022, upon closing of an underwritten public offering, we raised gross proceeds of 7.6 million from the issuance of (i) 151,500 shares of our common stock, (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 151,500 shares of common stock, and (iii) common stock purchase warrants to purchase up to 333,300 shares of common stock. We received 6.8 million in proceeds net of underwriting fees and other expenses. In April 2022, the pre-funded warrants were exercised in full. On August 11, 2022, upon the closing of an underwritten public offering, we raised proceeds of 10.0 million from the issuance of (i) 1,075,290 shares of our common stock, and, in lieu of common stock to certain investors that so chose, pre-funded warrants to purchase 87,500 shares of our common stock, and (ii) accompanying warrants to purchase 1,265,547 shares of our common stock. We received 9.1 million in proceeds net of underwriting fees and other expenses. In August 2022, the pre-funded warrants were exercised in full. On January 6, 2023, we effected a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of our common stock. All share and per share amounts in this quarterly report have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the Reverse Stock Split. Aytu s Board of Directors implemented the reverse stock split with the objective of regaining compliance with the 1.00 minimum bid price requirement of the Nasdaq Capital Market. On January 23, 2023, Nasdaq confirmed we regained compliance with this listing rule. A cash payment was made to each stockholder in lieu of any fractional interest in a share to which each stockholder would otherwise be entitled as a result of the reverse stock split. The reverse stock split reduced the number of shares of outstanding common stock from approximately 68.8 million shares to approximately 3.4 million shares. As a result of the reverse stock split, proportional adjustments were also made to outstanding warrants and options, and to the shares available for grant in our equity incentive plan. On June 8, 2023, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain institutional investors named therein and a placement agency agreement with Maxim Group LLC, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to investors in the offering an aggregate of 1,743,695 shares of the Company s common stock, pre-funded warrants in lieu of shares to purchase 430,217 shares of common stock, accompanying Tranche A warrants to purchase 2,173,912 shares of common stock, and accompanying Tranche B warrants to purchase 2,173,912 shares of common stock in a best-efforts offering. The common warrants may be exercised for either shares of common stock or pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock at a future exercise price of 0.0001 per share in the same form as the pre-funded warrant. The gross proceeds were 4.0 million and net proceeds were approximately 3.4 million after deducting offering expenses. The offering closed on June 13, 2023.

 During the year ended June 30, 2023, we issued 699,929 shares of common stock under the ATM Sales Agreement (as defined below) with total gross proceeds of approximately 3.0 million before deducting commissions of 3 and other offering expenses including legal and audit fees. Discontinued Products As part of our realization of post-acquisition synergies and product prioritization, we have implemented a portfolio rationalization plan whereby we will discontinue or divest five non-core products in our Rx Segment: Cefaclor Oral Suspension, Flexichamber, Tussionex, Tuzistra XR, and ZolpiMist. These products, collectively, contributed 1.6 million and 2.1 million in net revenue during the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

 During the year ended June 30, 2023, net product revenue increased b y 10.7 million, or 11 compared to the year ended June 30, 2022. The increase in our Rx Segment product lines was primarily due to higher volume due to shortages of competing ADHD products, the effectiveness of our Aytu Rx Connect program, and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs. The decrease in the Consumer Health Segment s net revenue was due to the reduction of our direct mailing business to focus our efforts on the higher profitability of our e-commerce business. We expect the revenue from our Consumer Health Segment to continue to decrease in fiscal 2024 as we look to monetize or discontinue this segment. Gross margin by segment 

Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 Change Gross margin by segment: Rx Segment 71 56 15 Consumer Health Segment 43 51 (8) Total gross margin by segment 62 54 8 During the year ended June 30, 2023, gross margins increased by 8 compared to the year ended June 30, 2022. The improvement in Rx Segment gross margin percentage was primarily due to the greater volumes resulting in greater utilization of our manufacturing facilities. The lower gross margin in our Consumer Health Segment was due to the focus on our e-commerce business, which has lower gross margins, but higher contribution margins than our direct mailing business. In addition, we recorded an inventory impairment write-off of 2.1 million in the Consumer Health Segment. Advertising and direct marketing (Consumer Health Segment) During the year ended June 30, 2023, advertising and direct marketing expenses decreased by 2.4 million, or 12 , compared to the year ended June 30, 2022. Advertising and direct marketing expense include direct-to-consumer marketing, advertising, sales, and customer support and processing fees related to our Consumer Health Segment. The reduction in advertising and direct marketing costs were due to our focus on our e-commerce business during fiscal 2023. We expect advertising and direct marketing expenses to decrease from 2023 levels as we continue to reduce our direct mailing business and monetize or discontinue our Consumer Health Segment. Other selling and marketing During the year ended June 30, 2023, other selling and marketing expense increased 5.1 million, or 27 , compared to the year ended June 30, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher commission expense, a result of the higher subscriptions generated by our sales force. In addition, we incurred increased commercial marketing program fees due to the higher volumes generated. General and administrative During the year ended June 30, 2023, general and administrative expense decreased by 2.5 million or 8 , compared to the year ended June 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to reductions of redundancies from the Neos and Innovus acquisitions.

 Research and development 

Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 Change (In thousands) Research and development: AR101 1,880 10,673 (8,793) ADHD 1,803 702 1,101 Healight 250 926 (676) Others 162 361 (199) Total Research and development 4,095 12,662 (8,567) During the year ended June 30, 2023, research and development expense decreased by 8.6 million, or 68 , compared to the year ended June 30, 2022. Our research and development costs were primarily associated with our AR101 product candidate and support of our ADHD products, Adzenys and Contempla, and to a lesser extent, the development of our Healight product candidate, and support for our commercialized products. In October 2022, we announced the suspension of the development of AR101 and Healight to focus on our commercial operations, resulting in the decrease in expenses in fiscal 2023. Impairment expense During the year ended June 30, 2023, we recognized total impairment expense of 5.7 million, consisting of (i) 5.6 million intangible assets, and (ii) 0.1 million other assets. The impairments were due to increased focus on our commercial efforts in the Rx Segment and discontinued product distributions in the Consumer Health Segment. See Note 7 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. During the year ended June 30, 2022, we recognized total impairment expense of 75.5 million, consisting of (i) 65.8 million in goodwill, (ii) 7.1 million intangible assets, (iii) 2.0 million inventory, (iv) 0.4 million other assets and (v) 0.2 million property and equipment. The impairment expense related to write-down of assets was due to the discontinuation of commercializing certain products and products not marketed. See Note 7 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. Amortization of intangible assets During the year ended June 30, 2023, amortization expense of intangible assets, excluding amounts included in cost of sales, decreased by 1.1 million, or 18 , compared to the year ended June 30, 2022. The decreases were primarily related to the smaller intangible asset base due to the impairments of certain intangible assets during fiscal year 2022. Gain or loss from contingent consideration We fair value our acquisition-related contingent considerations based on our projected results, any changes are reflected through income or expense. During the year ended June 30, 2023, the gain from contingent considerations decreased by 0.7 million, or 41 , compared to the year ended June 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the contingent considerations (including CVRs) expiring or winding down during the fiscal year of 2023. Other (expense) income, net During the year ended June 30, 2023, other expense, net increased by 4.0 million compared to the year ended June 30, 2022. Other expense, net, includes interest expense, accretion from fixed payment arrangements, and other income. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, we received payments related to the divestiture of Natesto, which was recorded as other income. Starting the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we did not receive such payments.

 Unrealized gain or loss on derivative warrant liabilities We fair value our derivative warrant liabilities using either the Monte Carlo simulation model or the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Derivative warrant liabilities are revalued at each reporting period and changes are reflected through income or expense. During the year ended June 30, 2023, the net gain from derivative warrant liability increased by 3.2 million when compared to the year ended June 30, 2022. The net increase was primarily due to higher fair values of derivative liabilities from warrants issued during fiscal year 2023. See Note 14 Stockholders Equity and Note 12 Fair Value Considerations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details. Income tax benefit For the fiscal year ended 2023, there was no income tax benefit, primarily driven by the Internal Revenue Code Section 382 limitation on net operating loss utilization. For the fiscal year ended 2022, the impairment of the Rx Segment book goodwill decreased the net deferred tax liability by 0.1 million resulting in an income tax benefit of 0.1 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows The following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash for the periods indicated: 

Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 Change (In thousands) Net cash used in operating activities (5,129) (28,823) 23,694 Net cash used in investing activities (117) (3,248) 3,131 Net cash provided by financing activities 8,871 1,530 7,341 Net Cash Used in Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities during these periods primarily reflected our net losses, partially offset by changes in working capital and non-cash charges including goodwill and intangible asset impairment, inventory write-down, changes in fair values of various liabilities, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, amortization and accretion, and other charges. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities totaled 5.1 million. The decrease in net cash used was primarily the result of the decrease in operating loss, and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable, inventory, and prepaid expenses. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, net cash used in operating activities totaled 28.8 million. The use of cash was approximately 81.4 million less than the net loss primarily due to non-cash charges of depreciation, amortization and accretion, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, stock-based compensation, inventory and other assets write-downs and loss on debt extinguishment. These charges were offset by gains from change in fair values of contingent consideration and contingent value rights. In addition, our use of cash decreased due to changes in working capital including decreases in accounts receivable, inventory and prepaids, offset by a decrease in accrued liabilities and accounts payable. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities is generally related to our merger and acquisitions as well as purchase of assets to support our operations.

Table of Contents 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 0.1 million during the year ended June 30, 2023. Net cash used in investing activities of 3.2 million during the year ended June 30, 2022, was primarily due to 3.2 million payment of contingent consideration. Net Cash from Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities of 8.9 million during the year ended June 30, 2023, was primarily from 3.4 million of net proceeds from our securities purchase agreement in June 2023, 9.1 million of net proceeds from our August 2022 equity raise, and 2.9 million net proceeds from our sales under the ATM Sales Agreement; partially offset by 2.3 million of net payments made under our short-term line of credit, and fixed payment arrangements totaling 4.3 million. Net cash provided by financing activities of 1.5 million during the year ended June 30, 2022, was primarily from 15.0 million proceeds from long-term debt and 11.7 million net proceeds from issuance of our common stock, partially offset by 16.1 million full repayment of long-term debt, 4.1 million net reduction in our revolving loan, 4.4 million in payments of fixed payment arrangements and 0.5 million payment of debt issuance costs. Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity We have obligations related to our loan agreements, contingent considerations related to our acquisitions, milestone payments for licensed products and manufacturing purchase commitments. We finance our operations through a combination of sales of our common stock and warrants, borrowings under our line of credit facility and cash generated from operations. Shelf Registrations On September 28, 2021, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective by the SEC on October 7, 2021. This shelf registration statement covered the offering, issuance and sale by the Company of up to an aggregate of 100.0 million of its common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights and units (the 2021 Shelf ). As of June 30, 2023, approximately 82.4 million remains available under the 2021 Shelf. This availability is subject to SEC 1.B.6 limitations of Form S-3.

The common warrants may be exercised for either shares of common stock or pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock at a future exercise price of 0.0001 per share in the same form as the pre-funded warrant. The gross proceeds were 4.0 million, and net proceeds were approximately 3.4 million after deducting offering expenses. The offering closed on June 13, 2023. On August 11, 2022, we closed an underwritten public offering, pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of (i) 1,075,290 shares of its common stock, (ii), pre-funded warrants to purchase 87,500 shares of its common stock, and (ii) accompanying warrants to purchase 1,265,547 shares of our common stock. The shares of common stock (or pre-funded warrants) and the accompanying common warrants were issued separately but could only be purchased together. The combined public offering price for each share of common stock and accompanying common warrant was 8.60, and the combined offering price for each pre-funded warrant and accompanying common warrant is 8.58, which equals the public offering price per share of the common stock and accompanying common warrant, less the 0.001 per share exercise price of each pre-funded warrant. The pre-funded warrants were exercised in full in August 2022. The common warrants are exercisable at any time after the date of issuance for a period of five years from the date such common warrants are first exercisable. The number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the common warrants is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, including a stock split of, stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or recapitalization of the common stock. The Company received gross proceeds of 10.0 million and net proceeds were approximately 9.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. On March 7, 2022, we closed on an underwritten public offering, pursuant to which, we sold (i) 151,500 shares of our common stock, (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 151,500 shares of common stock, and (iii) common warrants to purchase up to 333,300 shares of common stock.

The interest rate on the loan is the greater of the prime rate and 3.25 , plus 7.4 , payable monthly in arrears. We met certain milestones which resulted in monthly payments consisting of interest only. The principal amount will become due on the maturity date of the loan is January 26, 2025. The proceeds from the Avenue Capital Agreement were used towards the repayment of outstanding debt. In the event we prepay the outstanding principal prior to the maturity date, we will pay Avenue Capital a fee equal to (i) 3.0 of the loan if such event occurs on or before January 26 2023, (ii) 2.0 of the loan if such event occurs after January 26, 2023 but on or before January 26, 2024, and (iii) 1.0 of the loan if such event occurs after January 26, 2024 but before January 26, 2025.

See Note 10 Line of Credit in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies As a result of our acquisitions and licensing agreements, we are contractually and contingently obliged to pay, when due, various fixed and contingent milestone payments. See Note 18 Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information. On May 12, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with Tris to terminate the License, Development, Manufacturing and Supply Agreement dated November 2, 2018 related to Tuzistra (the Tuzistra License Agreement ). Pursuant to such termination, the Company agreed to pay Tris a total of approximately 6 million to 9 million, which reduced our total liability for minimum payments by approximately 8.0 million from the original License Agreement. The settlement payment will be paid in three installments from December 2022 through July 2024, with a provision that allows for the Company to pay interest on any principal amounts due but remaining unpaid past the scheduled payment date. Upon closing of the acquisition of a line of prescription pediatric products from Cerecor, Inc. in October 2019, we assumed payment obligations that require us to make fixed and product milestone payments. As of June 30, 2023, up to 3.8 million of fixed and product milestone payments remain through 2026 and are expected to be paid from the revenue generated by Karbinal ER. In connection with the February 2020 acquisition of Innovus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Innovus Acquisition ), all of Innovus s shares were converted to our common stock and contingent value rights CVRs ), which represents contingent additional consideration of up to 16.0 million payable to satisfy future performance milestones. As of June 30, 2023, up to 5.0 million of potential CVR milestone payments remain, which we do not expect to pay. These CVR milestone payments expire on December 31, 2023. In connection with our Innovus Acquisition, we assumed a contingent obligation which required us to make milestone payment of 0.5 million, between fiscal year 2026 through fiscal year 2033 to Novalere, if and when certain levels of FlutiCare sales are achieved. In connection with our acquisition of the Rumpus assets, upon satisfaction of milestones, we may be required to pay up to 67.5 million in regulatory and commercial-based earn-out payments to Rumpus. Under the licensing agreement with Denovo Biopharma LLC Denovo ), we are required to make a payment of 0.6 million for a license fee in April 2022 and upon achievement of regulatory and commercial milestones, up to 101.7 million. Under the licensing agreement with Johns Hopkins University JHU ), upon achievement of regulatory and commercial milestone, we may be required to pay up to 1.6 million to JHU. In fiscal 2022, two milestones payable to Rumpus were achieved totaling 4.0 million, which were paid in 109,447 shares of common stock and 2.6 million in cash. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments 
 66 

Table of Contents 
 that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting policies to the notes to our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue recognition We generate revenue from product sales through our Rx Segment and Consumer Health Segment. We evaluate our contracts with customers to determine revenue recognition using the following five-step model: (1) identify the contract with the customer; (2) identify the performance obligations and if they are distinct; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied. Net product sales in the Rx Segment consist of sales of prescription pharmaceutical products under the Rx Portfolio, principally to a limited number of wholesale distributors and pharmacies in the United States. Rx product revenue is recognized at the point in time that control of the product transfers to the customer in accordance with shipping terms (i.e., upon delivery), which is generally free-on-board destination when shipped domestically within the United States and free-on-board shipping point when shipped internationally consistent with the contractual terms. The Company makes estimates of the net sales price, including estimates of variable consideration to be incurred on the respective product sales (known as Gross to Net adjustments). Estimating gross to net adjustments and applying the constraint on variable consideration requires the use of significant management judgment and other market data. The Gross to Net adjustments include: Savings offers The Company offers savings programs for its patients covered under commercial payor plans in which the cost of a prescription to such patients is discounted. Prompt payment discounts Prompt payment discounts are based on standard provisions of wholesalers services. Wholesale distribution fees Wholesale distribution fees are based on definitive contractual agreements for the management of the Company s products by wholesalers. Rebates The Rx Portfolio products are subject to commercial managed care and government (i.e. Medicaid) programs whereby discounts and rebates are provided to participating managed care organizations and federal and/or state governments. Calculations related to rebate accruals are estimated based on historical information from third-party providers. Wholesaler chargebacks The Rx Portfolio products are subject to certain programs with wholesalers whereby pricing on products is discounted below wholesaler list price to participating entities. These entities purchase products through wholesalers at the discounted price, and the wholesalers charge the difference between their acquisition cost and the discounted price back to the Company following the product purchases of the wholesalers end customers.

Table of Contents 
 Returns Wholesalers contractual return rights are limited to defective product, product that was shipped in error, product ordered by customer in error, product returned due to overstock, product returned due to dating or product returned due to recall or other changes in regulatory guidelines. The return policy for expired product allows the wholesaler to return such product starting six months prior to expiry date to twelve months post expiry date. The Company analyzes return data available from sales since inception date to determine a reliable return rate. 
 Savings offers, rebates and wholesaler chargebacks reflect the terms of underlying agreements, which may vary. Accordingly, actual amounts will depend on the mix of sales by product and contracting entity. Future returns may not follow historical trends. Our periodic adjustments of our estimates are subject to time delays between the initial product sale and ultimate reporting and settlement of deductions. We continually monitor these provisions and do not believe variances between actual and estimated amounts have been material. A 10 increase or decrease in these estimates impacts net sales by a corresponding increase or decrease of approximately 3.3 million. We generate Consumer Health Segment product revenue from sales of various consumer health products through e-commerce platforms and direct mail. Revenue is generally recognized free-on-board shipping point, as those are the agreed-upon contractual terms. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction that are collected by us from a customer are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in cost of sales . Impairment of Long-lived Assets We assess impairment of long-lived assets annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicates that their carrying value amount may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment, net and goodwill and other intangible assets, net. Circumstances which could trigger a review include but are not limited to: (i) significant decreases in the market price of the asset; (ii) significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal or regulatory factors; (iii) changes in business plans or (iv) expectations that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. If the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, from the use of an asset are less than the carrying value, a write-down would be recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value. Such estimates involve projections of future sales and costs, which may vary from actual results. Declines in the outlook for the related products, particularly soon after fair-value measurement upon acquisition or prior impairment, can negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying value and can result in an impairment charge. Our strategy is to continue building our portfolio of revenue-generating products by leveraging our commercial team s expertise to build leading brands within large therapeutic markets. As a result of focusing on building the portfolio of revenue-generating prescription products, we have decided to abandon active development of its NT0502 (N-desethyloxybutynin), a new chemical entity that is for the treatment of sialorrhea, which is excessive salivation or drooling. During the year ended June 30, 2023, we incurred an impairment charge of 2.6 million related to NT0502 and have terminated the licensing agreement. We also terminated the license agreement with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center surrounding the Healight technology platform as an additional result of terminating the development of the Healight program. Further, the acquired product distribution rights from Innovus was impaired by 3.0 million due to discontinuance of products in the Consumer Health Segment. During the year ended June 30, 2022, in connection with the decision to discontinue commercializing or divesting certain products within the Rx Segment that have minimal revenue and gross margin contribution, the Company recorded 4.9 million impairment expense for the write-down of intangible assets consisting of (i) 2.6 million for AcipHex Sprinkle, (ii) 1.4 million for ZolpiMist, (iii) 0.5 million for Tussionex, (iv) 0.2 million for Cefaclor and (v) 0.2 million for the Neos tradename. Additionally, our Consumer Health Segment recorded an impairment of 2.2 million related to products no longer being marketed and products that have been underperforming.

 Goodwill Goodwill is recorded as the difference between the fair value of the purchase consideration and the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired. As described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements, Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an intangible asset may not be recoverable. If, after assessing events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying value. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recorded in the amount of the difference. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using a combination of a market multiple and a discounted cash flow approach. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of estimates, assumptions and judgment. The principal estimates and assumptions that we use include prospective financial information (revenue growth, operating margins, and capital expenditures), future market conditions, weighted average costs of capital, a terminal growth rate, comparable multiples of publicly traded companies in our industry, and the earnings metrics and multiples utilized. We believe that the estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments are reasonable. We have determined that we have two reporting units that require periodic review for goodwill impairment, the Rx Segment, and the Consumer Health Segment. During the fiscal year 2022, our market capitalization significantly declined. The decline was considered a qualitative factor that led us to assess whether an impairment had occurred. The evaluation indicated that the goodwill related to one of the reporting units within the Rx Segment and Consumer Health Segment was potentially impaired. We performed a quantitative impairment test. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of 65.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2022. At June 30, 2022, we had no goodwill recorded on our balance sheet. Warrants Equity classified warrants are valued using a Black-Scholes options pricing model at issuance and are not remeasured. Liability classified warrants are carried at fair value using either the Black-Scholes option pricing or Monte Carlo simulation model. Changes in the fair value of liability classified warrants in subsequent periods are recorded as a gain or loss on remeasurement and reported as a component of cash flows from operations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide information under this item. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA The financial statements required by this item are identified in Item (a)(1) of Part IV and begin at page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and

Table of Contents 
 forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2023, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our controls were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Notwithstanding the material weakness, our management believes that the financial statements included elsewhere in this report present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows in conformity with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the period ended June 30, 2023, we concluded that we had a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to our analysis for the accounting for valuation of our inventory. At year end, it was determined that the analysis of over/under absorbed manufacturing costs was not performed, which could have led to material misstatement of our financial statement. If not addressed, the deficiency could result in a material misstatement in the future. In response, we have incorporated the process for quantifying any over or under absorbed manufacturing costs, and having the appropriate level of management evaluate the analysis and materiality of any over or under absorption. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) . Our management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria. Grant Thornton, LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, was not required to issue an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Previous Disclosure of Material Weakness in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting As disclosed in our September 30, 2022 Form 10-Q/A, we identified a material weakness in controls over the accounting for complex warrant issuances and the classification of these issued warrants. This material weakness resulted in the failure to prevent material adjustments in accounting for the warrants as equity classification when the warrants should have been classified as liabilities and marked to market each reporting period. While we have processes to properly identify and evaluate the appropriate accounting technical pronouncements, other literature, and consultation with third-party experts, we did not classify the warrants correctly. Remediation Plan Our Audit Committee conducted an internal investigation to identify and determine a plan to remediate the material weakness described above and to enhance our overall control environment. We will not consider the material weakness remediated until our enhanced control is operational for a sufficient period of time and tested, enabling management to conclude that the enhanced controls are operating effectively. Our remediation plan includes the implementation of controls over the process of reviewing significant and complex contracts and agreements. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Except for the material weakness noted above, there have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2023, that have material effect, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC. These rules generally attribute beneficial ownership of securities to persons who possess sole or shared voting power or investment power with respect to those securities and include common stock that can be acquired within 60 days of August 31, 2023. The percentage ownership information shown in the table is based upon 5,530,027 shares of common stock outstanding as of August 31, 2023. Except as otherwise indicated, all of the shares reflected in the table are shares of common stock and all persons listed below have sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares beneficially owned by them, subject to applicable community property laws. The information is not necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose. In computing the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deemed outstanding shares of common stock subject to options and warrants held by that person that are immediately exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of August 31, 2023. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Beneficial ownership representing less than 1 is denoted with an asterisk ).

 Jarrett T. Disbrow, the brother of Joshua R. Disbrow, our Chief Executive Officer, is employed by us as Chief Business Officer and President, Consumer Health. His total annual salary and other cash compensation was approximately 427,000, which consists of 365,000 base salary plus 62,000 cash bonus during the year ended June 30, 2023, and he receives benefits consistent with other employees serving in the same capacity. Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons Effective upon its adoption in July 2016, pursuant to the Audit Committee Charter, the Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving all related party transactions as defined under Item 404 of Regulation S-K, after reviewing each such transaction for potential conflicts of interests and other improprieties. Our policies and procedures for review and approval of transactions with related persons are in writing in our Code of Conduct and Ethics available on our website at http://www.aytubio.com under the Investor Relations Corporate Governance tab. Prior to the adoption of the Audit Committee Charter, and due to the small size of our company, we did not have a formal written policy regarding the review of related party transactions, and relied on our Board of Directors to review, approve or ratify such transactions and identify and prevent conflicts of interest. Our Board of Directors reviewed any such transaction in light of the particular affiliation and interest of any involved director, officer or other employee or stockholder and, if applicable, any such person s affiliates or immediate family members. Director Independence Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. Therefore, we must comply with the exchange rules regarding director independence. Audit Committee members must satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for listed companies. In order to be considered to be independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3, a member of an audit committee of a listed company may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the audit committee, the board of directors or any other board committee: (1) accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries; or (2) be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries. Four of our five directors are independent under the definition of NASDAQ. Josh Disbrow is not independent under either definition due to being an executive officer of our Company.

 ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES , or Grant Thornton has served as our independent auditor since December 2022 and has been appointed by our Audit Committee to continue as our independent auditor for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. , or Plante Moran has served as our independent auditor until December 2022. The following table presents aggregate fees for professional services rendered by our principal independent registered public accounting firms, Grant Thornton for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, and Plante Moran for the year ended June 30, 2022, for the audit of our annual financial statements. 

Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 (In thousands) Audit fees 940 547 Audit related fees 32 Total fees 940 579 

 Audit-related fees for both fiscal years 2023 and 2022 were comprised of fees related to registration statements, including S-1, S-3 and S-8 filings, our registered offerings, and at-the-market (ATM) offerings. In addition to the amounts above, 0.1 million in professional services was rendered by Plante Moran as our principal independent auditor for the financial statements included in our Form 10 Q and 10-Q/A during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. Dismissal of Independent Registered Public Accountants. On December 12, 2022, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Aytu BioPharma, Inc. (the Company dismissed Plante Moran, PLLC Plante Moran ), as the Company s independent registered public accounting firm. The reports of Plante Moran on the Company s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except for Plante Moran s report on the financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2022, which contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, and through the date of Plante Moran s dismissal, there were (i) no disagreements (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) between the Company and Plante Moran on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Plante Moran would have caused Plante Moran to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its reports on the Company s consolidated financial statements for such years and (ii) no reportable events as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K, except for the material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting previously reported in Part II, Item 9A Controls and Procedures in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2021, as amended. The Company concluded that it had a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting related to the analysis for the accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. The Company performs an assessment to determine if an impairment of long-lived assets has occurred annually or when circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. This assessment was prepared by internal staffing and reviewed by the Chief Financial Officer. At the June 30, 2021 fiscal year end, it was determined that the Company improperly aggregated certain assets when performing this assessment. This resulted in an incorrect conclusion that no impairment had occurred. This deficiency did not result in a revision of any of the Company s previously issued financial statements. However, if not addressed, the deficiency could have resulted in a material misstatement in the future. In response, the Company incorporated utilization of third-party providers to review its assumptions and computations in the Company s impairment analysis for completeness and accuracy. The Company believes that its controls are now designed properly and operating effectively.

Engagement of New Independent Registered Public Accountants. On December 12, 2022, the Audit Committee appointed Grant Thornton LLP as the Company s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2022 and the subsequent interim period through December 12, 2022, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf has consulted with Grant Thornton with respect to either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company s consolidated financial statements, and neither a written report nor oral advice was provided to the Company that Grant Thornton concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of Regulation S-K) or a reportable event (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders Aytu BioPharma, Inc. Opinion on the financial statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Aytu BioPharma, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the Company as of June 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company s net loss was 17.1 million and cash used in operating activities was 5.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2023, and as of that date, the Company s accumulated deficit was 304.1 million. These conditions, along with other matters as set forth in Note 1, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical audit matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on

 the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing an opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Variable consideration in contracts with customers As described in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company makes estimates of the net sales price, including estimates of variable consideration to be incurred on the respective product sales. A key source of information used by management to develop the estimate for the ADHD portfolio savings offerings and commercial rebates (collectively the GtN adjustments is inventory levels in the distribution channel as of the balance sheet date. We identified this key source of information as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination that those inventory levels in the distribution channel as of the balance sheet date are a critical audit matter are (a) the inherent limitations over management s visibility and insight into the underlying details of the source data, which requires management to depend and rely on external data from multiple sources and (b) the extent to which the external data is used by management to develop the estimate of GtN adjustments. Our audit procedures related to this critical audit matter included the following, among others. (i) We evaluated the relevance and reliability of the external data used by management to develop the estimate of inventory levels in the distribution channel as of the balance sheet date. (ii) We tested management s process of reconciling the external data from multiple sources used to develop the estimate of inventory levels in the distribution channel as of the balance sheet date. (iii) We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency in the application of the inventory levels in the distribution channel as of the balance sheet date as it relates to management s methods and assumptions used in developing the estimate of GtN adjustments. /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP We have served as the Company s auditor since 2022.

 AYTU BIOPHARMA, INC. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements business segments (i) the Rx Segment, consisting of prescription pharmaceutical products and (ii) the Consumer Health Segment, which consists of various consumer healthcare products (the Consumer Health Portfolio ). The Company was originally incorporated as Rosewind Corporation on August 9, 2002 in the State of Colorado and was re-incorporated as Aytu BioScience, Inc in the state of Delaware on June 8, 2015. Following the acquisition of Neos Therapeutics, Inc. Neos in March 2021, (the Neos Acquisition the Company changed its name to Aytu BioPharma, Inc. On January 6, 2023, the Company effected a reverse stock split in which each common stockholder received one share of common stock for every twenty shares held Reverse Stock Split ). Where applicable, all share and per share amounts in this annual report have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the Reverse Stock Split. The Rx Segment primarily consists of product portfolios: Adzenys XR-ODT (amphetamine) extended-release orally disintegrating tablets and Cotempla XR-ODT (methylphenidate) extended-release orally disintegrating tablets for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD together the ADHD Portfolio , and the Pediatric Portfolio consisting of Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor, two complementary prescription fluoride-based supplement product lines containing combinations of fluoride and vitamins in various formulations for infants and children with fluoride deficiency, and Karbinal ER, an extended-release antihistamine suspension containing carbinoxamine indicated to treat numerous allergic conditions. The Consumer Health Portfolio consists of multiple consumer health products competing in large healthcare categories, including allergy, hair regrowth, diabetes support, digestive health, urological health and general wellness, commercialized through direct mail and e-commerce marketing channels. The Company s strategy is to continue building its portfolio of revenue-generating products, leveraging its commercial team s expertise to build leading brands within large therapeutic and consumer markets. As a result of focusing on building the portfolio of revenue-generating products, the Company has indefinitely suspended active development of its clinical development program AR101 (enzastaurin), and has terminated the license agreements relating to Healight and NT0502 (N-desethyloxybutynin). As of June 30, 2023, the Company had million of cash and cash equivalents and million in accounts receivable. The Company incurred a net loss of million and million during the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company had an accumulated deficit of million and million as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Cash used in operations was million and million during the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition, the Company has non-operating liabilities that are scheduled to, or may become current in the eighteen months following the filing of this 10-K, most notably the maturity of the million Avenue Capital term note (the Avenue Note ). The Company expects to refinance the Avenue Note in the event it does not have sufficient cash on hand to retire it. As a result, there exists substantial about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. Management plans to mitigate the conditions that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern are primarily focused on i) eliminating expenses for clinical development, ii) winding down or monetizing the Consumer Health Segment, which has generated negative cash flows since its acquisition in 2021, iii) refinancing its million Avenue Note (see Note 11 Long-term Debt) to extend its maturity date, and, if necessary iv) raising additional capital through public or private equity, debt offerings, or monetizing additional assets in order to meet its obligations.

See Prior Period Reclassification in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Previously Reported Segment Information . During the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company identified an omission regarding the disclosure of certain key metrics of its reportable segments under ASC 280 related to the year ended June 30, 2022. During the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company inappropriately reported the net income of each of its segments as opposed to operating income which more closely aligns with the adjusted EBITDA metric that is utilized by its chief operating decision maker. The impact on June 30, 2022 was that million and million of operating loss relating to the Rx Segment and Consumer Health segment, respectively, should have been reported as a separate line. The Company assessed the materiality of this omission on the previously issued interim and annual consolidated financial statements in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99. The Company concluded that the omission was not material to any of the previously issued consolidated financial statements and began reporting operating results by segment in accordance with ASC 280 on a prospective basis starting with the year ended June 30, 2023

Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. ASU 2020-06 removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for it.

Financial Instruments Credit Losses.

The main objective of ASU 2016-13 is to provide additional information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit. The standard is effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2022.

The carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment and changes during the year ended June 30, 2022 are as follows: Goodwill impairment ) ) ) Balance as of June 30, 2022 During the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company s market capitalization significantly declined. The decline was considered a qualitative factor that led management to reassess whether an impairment had occurred. Management s evaluation indicated that the goodwill related to its reporting units in both the Rx and Consumer Health segments were potentially impaired. The Company then performed a quantitative impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and compared that amount to its carrying value. Significant assumptions inherent in the valuation methodologies include, but were not limited to prospective financial information, growth rates, terminal value, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry. The decline in market capitalization was an indicator of increased risk thereby increasing the discount rates in the valuation models. The Company determined the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing the discounted cash flow model. Using a risk adjusted weighted-average discount rate, the fair value of the reporting units was less than its carrying value. The Company recognized an impairment charge of million in the Rx Segment, associated with the Cerecor and Neos acquisition and a million impairment charge in the Consumer Health Segment related to the goodwill associated with the Innovus Acquisition.

Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurement The Company s financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, were fixed payment arrangements, goodwill and intangible assets. Fixed payment arrangements are recognized at their amortized cost basis using market appropriate discount rates and are accreted up to their notional face value over time. Significant assumptions used in valuing the fixed payment arrangements were discount rates from to , and are classified as Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. In May 2022, the Company recognized a fixed payment arrangement liability of million relating to the termination of the License, Development, Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Tris.

 Equivalent term (years) - Risk-free rate - Dividend yield Expected volatility was based primarily on historical volatility. The Company chose to use a two-year lookback on historical volatility to avoid the effects of COVID-19 and the Innovus acquisition. The Company believes this method produced an estimate that was representative of the Company s expectations of future volatility over the expected term of these warrants, and will not differ materially. If expected volatility by the active market is higher than estimated, the derivative may result in a greater fair value. The expected life was based on the remaining contractual term of the warrants. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury rate that corresponded to the expected term of the warrants. income tax benefit, primarily driven by Section 382 limitation on post-TCJA Tax Cuts and Jobs Act net operating loss NOL utilization, further described below.

Section 382 Limitation Under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, substantial changes in the Company s ownership may result in limitations on the amount of NOL carryforwards that can be utilized in future years. NOL carryforwards are subject to examination in the year they are utilized regardless of whether the tax year in which they are generated has been closed by statute. The amount subject to disallowance is limited to the NOL utilized. Accordingly, the Company may be subject to examination for prior NOLs generated as such NOLs are utilized. As part of the Company s Section 382 analysis, an ownership change was determined to have occurred in March 2022 at a point in time when the Company had a net unrealized built-in gain. As such, the NOL generated during that period has been allocated and the post-change NOL (approximately million) is determined to be fully available to offset fiscal 2023 pre-change income subject to the 80 limitation. The Company also determined that ownership change occurred in June 2023 at a time that the Company was in a net unrealized loss position. As a result of the Section 382 analysis, the Company had estimated million of disallowed recognized built-in loss and had carried forward as an operating loss as of June 30, 2023. The Company had federal net operating losses of approximately million as of June 30, 2023, that subject to limitation (as described above), may be available in future tax years to offset taxable income. Of the available federal net operating losses, approximately million can be carried forward indefinitely, while the remaining balance will begin to expire in 2024 and completely expire in 2027. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had research and development credits of million, which begin to expire in 2024. The available state net operating losses, if not utilized to offset taxable income in future periods, will begin to expire in 2025 through 2039. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had various state NOL carryforwards. The determination of the state NOL carryforwards is dependent on apportionment percentages and state laws that can change from year to year and impact the amount of such carryforwards.

The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of million and million at June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, to reserve its net deferred tax assets. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, carry back opportunities and tax planning strategies in making the assessment. The Company believes it is more likely than not, that it will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the valuation allowance provided. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. The Company has no accrued interest related to its uncertain tax positions as they all relate to timing differences that would adjust the Company s net operating loss carryforward, interest expense carryover or research and development credit carryover and therefore do not require recognition. As a result of these timing differences, at June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions of million and million, respectively.

Application of Internal Revenue Code Section 280G. If any payment or benefit Employee would receive pursuant to a Change in Control from the Company or otherwise Payment would (i) constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and (ii) but for this sentence, be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the Excise Tax ), then such Payment shall be equal to the Reduced Amount. The Reduced Amount shall be either (x) the largest portion of the Payment that would result in no portion of the Payment being subject to the Excise Tax or (y) the largest portion, up to and including the total, of the Payment, whichever amount, after taking into account all applicable federal, state and local employment taxes, income taxes, and the Excise Tax (all computed at the highest applicable marginal rate), results in Employee s receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the greater economic benefit notwithstanding that all or some portion of the Payment may be subject to the Excise Tax. If a reduction in payments or benefits constituting parachute payments is necessary so that the Payment equals the Reduced Amount, reduction shall occur in the manner that results in the greatest economic benefit for Employee. If more than one method of reduction will result in the same economic benefit, the items so reduced will be reduced pro rata. In the event it is subsequently determined by the Internal Revenue Service that some portion of the Reduced Amount as determined pursuant to clause (x) in the preceding paragraph is subject to the 
 9 

 Excise Tax, Employee agrees to promptly return to the Company a sufficient amount of the Payment so that no portion of the Reduced Amount is subject to the Excise Tax. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Reduced Amount is determined pursuant to clause (y) in the preceding paragraph, Employee will have no obligation to return any portion of the Payment pursuant to the preceding sentence. Unless Employee and the Company agree on an alternative accounting firm, the accounting firm engaged by the Company for general tax compliance purposes as of the day prior to the effective date of the Change in Control shall perform the foregoing calculations. If the accounting firm so engaged by the Company is serving as accountant or auditor for the individual, entity or group effecting the Change in Control, the Company shall appoint a nationally recognized accounting firm to make the determinations required hereunder. The Company shall bear all expenses with respect to the determinations by such accounting firm required to be made hereunder. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the accounting firm engaged to make the determinations hereunder to provide its calculations, together with detailed supporting documentation, to the Employee and the Company within fifteen (15) calendar days after the date on which Employee s right to a Payment is triggered (if requested at that time by the Employee or the Company) or such other time as requested by Employee or the Company. 23. Indemnification. As a condition to the effectiveness of this Agreement, the Company and Employee shall enter into a mutually acceptable indemnification agreement. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the date first written above. AYTU BIOPHARMA, INC.

The Executive shall cooperate with any reasonable request of the physician in connection with such certification. If such question shall arise and the Executive shall fail to submit such certification, the Company s determination of such issue shall be binding on the Executive.

Each payment pursuant to this Agreement is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2); and 5. Change in Control Payment . The provisions of this Section 5 set forth certain terms of an agreement reached between the Executive and the Company regarding the Executive s rights and obligations upon the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company. These provisions are intended to assure and encourage in advance the Executive s continued attention and dedication to his assigned duties and his objectivity during the pendency and after the occurrence of any such event. These provisions shall apply in lieu of, and expressly supersede, the provisions of Section 4(b) regarding severance pay and benefits upon a termination of employment, if such termination of 
 5 

 employment occurs within 12 months after the occurrence of the first event constituting a Change in Control. These provisions shall terminate and be of no further force or effect beginning 12 months after the occurrence of a Change in Control. (a) Change in Control . During the Term, if within 12 months after a Change in Control, the Executive s employment is terminated by the Company without Cause as provided in Section 3(d) or the Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason as provided in Section 3(e), then, subject to the signing of the Separation Agreement and Release by the Executive and the Separation Agreement and Release effective all within the time frame set forth in the Separation Agreement and Release, (i) the Company shall pay the Executive a lump sum in cash in an amount equal to one times the sum of (A) the Executive s then current Base Salary (or the Executive s Base Salary in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control, if higher) plus (B) the Executive s target annual incentive compensation for the then- current year; and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any applicable option agreement or stock-based award agreement, all stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based grants to Executive by the Company or that may be granted in the future shall, irrespective of any provisions of his award agreements, immediately and irrevocably vest and become exercisable and any restrictions thereon shall lapse. All stock options shall remain exercisable from the date of such employment termination until the expiration of the term of such stock options; and (iii) if the Executive was participating in the Company s group health plan immediately prior to the Date of Termination and elects COBRA health continuation, then the Company shall pay to the Executive a monthly cash payment for 12 months or the Executive s COBRA health continuation period, whichever ends earlier, in an amount equal to the monthly employer contribution that the Company would have made to provide health insurance to the Executive if the Executive had remained employed by the Company; and (iv) The amounts payable under this Section 5(a) shall be paid or commence to be paid within 60 days after the Date of Termination; provided, however, that if the 60-day period begins in one calendar year and ends in a second calendar year, such payment shall be paid or commence to be paid in the second calendar year by the last day of such 60-day period. For the avoidance of doubt, all stock options and other stock-based awards held by the Executive as of the Effective Date shall be treated as indicated in the applicable award agreements. (b) Additional Limitation . (i) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that the amount of any compensation, payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, calculated in a manner consistent with Section 280G of the Code and the applicable regulations thereunder (the Aggregate Payments ), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then the Aggregate Payments shall be reduced (but not below zero) so that the sum of all of the Aggregate Payments shall be 1.00 less than the amount at which the Executive becomes subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code; provided that such reduction shall only occur if it would result in the Executive receiving a higher After Tax Amount (as defined below) than the Executive would 
 6 

 receive if the Aggregate Payments were not subject to such reduction. In such event, the Aggregate Payments shall be reduced in the following order, in each case, in reverse chronological order beginning with the Aggregate Payments that are to be paid the furthest in time from consummation of the transaction that is subject to Section 280G of the Code: (1) cash payments not subject to Section 409A of the Code; (2) cash payments subject to Section 409A of the Code; (3) equity-based payments and acceleration; and (4) non-cash forms of benefits; provided that in the case of all the foregoing Aggregate Payments all amounts or payments that are not subject to calculation under Treas. Reg. 1.280G-1, Q A-24(b) or (c) shall be reduced before any amounts that are subject to calculation under Treas. Reg. 1.280G-1, Q A-24(b) or (c). (ii) For purposes of this Section 5(b), the After Tax Amount means the amount of the Aggregate Payments less all federal, state, and local income, excise and employment taxes imposed on the Executive as a result of the Executive s receipt of the Aggregate Payments. For purposes of determining the After Tax Amount, the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation applicable to individuals for the calendar year in which the determination is to be made, and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rates of individual taxation in each applicable state and locality, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes. (iii) The determination as to whether a reduction in the Aggregate Payments shall be made pursuant to Section 5(b)(i) shall be made by a nationally recognized accounting firm selected by the Company (the Accounting Firm ), which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Executive within 15 business days of the Date of Termination, if applicable, or at such earlier time as is reasonably requested by the Company or the Executive. Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Executive. (c) Definitions . For purposes of this Section 5, the following terms shall have the following meanings: Change in Control shall mean the consummation of any of the following: (i) A sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company on a consolidated basis to an unrelated person or entity; or (ii) A merger, reorganization or consolidation in which the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company are converted into or exchanged for shares of the successor entity and the holders of the Company s outstanding voting power immediately prior to such transaction do not own at least a majority of the outstanding voting power of the surviving entity immediately upon the completion of such transaction; or (iii) The sale of all or a majority of the common stock of the Company to an unrelated person or entity; or (iv) Any other transaction in which the holders of the Company s outstanding voting power immediately prior to such transaction do not own at least a majority of the outstanding voting power of the surviving entity in the transaction immediately upon the completion of such transaction.

 6. Section 409A . (a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if at the time of the Executive s separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, the Company determines that the Executive is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then to the extent any payment or benefit that the Executive becomes entitled to under this Agreement on account of the Executive s separation from service would be considered deferred compensation otherwise subject to the 20 percent additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A(a) of the Code as a result of the application of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, such payment shall not be payable and such benefit shall not be provided until the date that is the earlier of (A) six months and one day after the Executive s separation from service, or (B) the Executive s death. If any such delayed cash payment is otherwise payable on an installment basis, the first payment shall include a catch-up payment covering amounts that would otherwise have been paid during the six-month period but for the application of this provision, and the balance of the installments shall be payable in accordance with their original schedule. (b) All in-kind benefits provided and expenses eligible for reimbursement under this Agreement shall be provided by the Company or incurred by the Executive during the time periods set forth in this Agreement. All reimbursements shall be paid as soon as administratively practicable, but in no event shall any reimbursement be paid after the last day of the taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense was incurred. The amount of in-kind benefits provided or reimbursable expenses incurred in one taxable year shall not affect the in-kind benefits to be provided or the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year (except for any lifetime or other aggregate limitation applicable to medical expenses). Such right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. (c) To the extent that any payment or benefit described in this Agreement constitutes non-qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, and to the extent that such payment or benefit is payable upon the Executive s termination of employment, then such payments or benefits shall be payable only upon the Executive s separation from service. The determination of whether and when a separation from service has occurred shall be made in accordance with the presumptions set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h). (d) The parties intend that this Agreement will be administered in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. To the extent that any provision of this Agreement is ambiguous as to its compliance with Section 409A of the Code, the provision shall be read in such a manner so that all payments hereunder comply with Section 409A of the Code. Each payment pursuant to this Agreement is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). The parties agree that this Agreement may be amended, as reasonably requested by either party, and as may be necessary to fully comply with Section 409A of the Code and all related rules and regulations in order to preserve the payments and benefits provided hereunder without additional cost to either party. (e) The Company makes no representation or warranty and shall have no liability to the Executive or any other person if any provisions of this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code but do not satisfy an exemption from, or the conditions of, such Section. 7. Intellectual Property . The Executive acknowledges that all discoveries, concepts, ideas, inventions, innovations, improvements, developments, methods, designs, analyses, drawings, reports, patent applications, copyrightable work and mask work (whether or not including any confidential 
 8

The Executive shall promptly disclose such Work Product to the Board and, at the Company s expense, perform all actions reasonably requested by the Board (whether during or after the period of employment) to establish and confirm such ownership (including, without limitation, executing and delivering assignments, consents, powers of attorney and other instruments). The Executive acknowledges that all Work Product shall be deemed to constitute works made for hire under the U.S. Copyright Act of 1976, as amended. 8. Confidential Information, Noncompetition and Cooperation . The Executive agrees that he continues to be bound by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. (a) The Executive agrees that all property (including, without limitation, all equipment, tangible proprietary information, documents, records, notes, contracts and computer- generated materials) furnished to or created or prepared by the Executive incident to the Executive s employment belongs to the Company and shall be promptly returned to the Company upon termination of the Executive s employment. (b) Upon termination of the Executive s employment, the Executive shall be deemed to have resigned from any and all offices and directorships then held with the Company and its affiliates. Following any termination of employment, the Executive shall reasonably cooperate with the Company (i) in the winding up of pending work on behalf of the Company and the orderly transfer of work to other employees, and (ii) in the defense of any action brought by any third party against the Company that relates to the Executive s employment by the Company; provided, that in each case the Company shall reimburse the Executive for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the Executive in connection with such cooperation. (c) The Executive acknowledges that in the course of the Executive s employment with the Company, the Executive will become familiar with the Company s and its affiliates trade secrets and with other confidential and proprietary information and that the Executive s services will be of special, unique and extraordinary value to the Company and its affiliates. Therefore, the Executive agrees that the Executive shall not, during the Term and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, directly or indirectly, either for himself or for any other person or entity or otherwise, (i) participate in any business or enterprise (including, without limitation, any division, group or franchise of a larger organization), engaged, anywhere within North America at the time of termination (the Restricted Territory ), in the business of developing or commercializing controlled release, ion exchange resin based pharmaceutical products or any therapeutic agent being studied for or approved for the treatment of vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (VEDS) or an associated connective tissue disorder, or any other business in which the Executive would be required to employ, reveal or otherwise utilize trade secrets of the Company and its affiliates used prior to termination that may result in a material injury to the Company (with it being understood that the term participate in shall include, without limitation, having any direct or indirect interest in any person or entity, whether as a sole proprietor, owner, stockholder, partner, joint venturer, creditor or otherwise, or rendering any direct or indirect service or assistance to any person or entity -whether as a director, officer, manager, supervisor, employee, agent, consultant, advisor or otherwise); provided that, nothing herein shall prohibit the Executive from being a passive owner of not more than two percent (2 of the outstanding stock of any class of an entity which is publicly traded so long as the Executive has no active participation in the business of 
 9 

 such corporation; (ii) induce or attempt to induce any customer, supplier, licensee or other business relation of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to cease doing business with the Company or any such subsidiary or in any way interfere with the relationship between any such customer, supplier, licensee or business relation and the Company and any such subsidiary; or (iii) induce or attempt to induce any employee of the Company or its affiliates to leave the employ of the Company or any such affiliated company, or in any way interfere with the relationship between the Company and any of its affiliates and any employee thereof, or hire or otherwise engage any person who was an employee of the Company or any of its affiliated companies within one year before any such hiring would take place. (d) The Executive agrees that he will not directly or indirectly, individually or in concert with others, make any statement calculated or likely to have the effect of undermining or disparaging the business or the business reputation of the Company or its affiliates or their respective employees, officers, directors, customers, suppliers, successors and assigns, including, without limitation, negative comments about any such person or company, its management methods, policies and/or practices. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prohibit the Executive from responding accurately and fully to any question, inquiry or request made in connection with any governmental inquiry, investigation, review, audit or proceeding, any legal proceeding or claim (whether in court, arbitration or otherwise) of any nature, or as otherwise required by law. (e) If, at the time of enforcement of this Section 8, a court holds that the restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties hereto agree that the maximum duration, scope or geographical area reasonable under such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated period, scope or area and that the court shall be allowed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum duration, scope and area permitted by law. Because the Executive s services are unique and because the Executive has access to confidential and proprietary information of the Company and its business, the parties hereto agree that money damages would not be an adequate remedy for any breach of Section 8 of this Agreement. Therefore, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of Section 8 of this Agreement, the Company or its successors or assigns may, in addition to other rights and remedies existing in their favor and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or injunctive or other equitable relief in order to enforce or prevent any violations of, the provisions hereof (without posting a bond or other security). (f) The Executive acknowledges that the provisions of this Section 8 are in consideration of the Executive s employment with the Company and additional good and valuable consideration as set forth in this Agreement. The Executive agrees and acknowledges that the restrictions contained in Section 8 do not preclude the Executive from earning a livelihood, nor do they unreasonably impose limitations on the Executive s ability to earn a living. The Executive acknowledges (i) that the business of the Company and its affiliates will be conducted throughout the Restricted Territory, (ii) notwithstanding the state of formation or principal office of the Company and its affiliates, or any of their respective executives or employees (including the Executive), it is expected that the Company will have business activities and have valuable business relationships within its industry throughout the Restricted Territory, and (iii) as part of the Executive s responsibilities, the Executive may be traveling throughout the Restricted Territory in furtherance of the Company s and its affiliates business and its relationships. The Executive acknowledges that the potential harm to the Company of the non-enforcement of Section 8 outweighs any potential harm to the Executive of its enforcement by injunction or otherwise. The Executive acknowledges that the Executive has carefully read this Agreement and has given careful consideration to the restraints imposed upon the Executive by this Agreement and is in full accord as to their necessity for the reasonable and proper protection of confidential and proprietary information of the Company and its subsidiaries now existing or to be 
 10 

 developed in the future. The Executive acknowledges that each and every restraint imposed by this Agreement is reasonable with respect to scope, duration, and geographical area. 9.

In the event that any person or entity other than the Executive or the Company may be a party with regard to any such controversy or claim, such controversy or claim shall be submitted to arbitration subject to such other person or entity s agreement. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. This Section 8 shall be specifically enforceable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8 shall not preclude either party from pursuing a court action for the sole purpose of obtaining a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction in circumstances in which such relief is appropriate; provided that any other relief shall be pursued through an arbitration proceeding pursuant to this Section 9. 10. Consent to Jurisdiction . To the extent that any court action is permitted consistent with or to enforce Section 9 of this Agreement, the parties hereby consent to the jurisdiction of the District Court of Douglas County, Colorado and the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. Accordingly, with respect to any such court action, the Executive (a) submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts; (b) consents to service of process; and (c) waives any other requirement (whether imposed by statute, rule of court, or otherwise) with respect to personal jurisdiction or service of process. 11. Integration .

Withholding . All payments made by the Company to the Executive under this Agreement shall be net of any tax or other amounts required to be withheld by the Company under applicable law. 13. Successor to the Executive .

Enforceability . If any portion or provision of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any portion or provision of any section of this Agreement) shall to any extent be declared illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the remainder of this Agreement, or the application of such portion or provision in circumstances other than those as to which it is so declared illegal or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each portion and provision of this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

Waiver . No waiver of any provision hereof shall be effective unless made in writing and signed by the waiving party. The failure of any party to require the performance of any term or obligation of this Agreement, or the waiver by any party of any breach of this Agreement, shall not prevent any subsequent enforcement of such term or obligation or be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach. 17.

 First Amendment to Lease Page 2 

 Proposed Tenant other than the tenant then occupying such space (or its affiliates), Landlord shall first allow Tenant the right to include the Offered Space within the Premises. (b) Such offer shall be made by Landlord to Tenant in a written notice (hereinafter called the Offer Notice which notice shall designate the space being offered and shall specify the terms for such Offered Space that Landlord intends to submit to prospective tenants in an effort to market the Offered Space. Tenant may accept the offer set forth in the Offer Notice by delivering to Landlord an unconditional acceptance (hereinafter called Tenant s Notice of such offer within five (5) business days after delivery by Landlord of the Offer Notice to Tenant. Time shall be of the essence with respect to the giving of Tenant s Notice. If Tenant does not accept (or fails to timely accept) an offer made by Landlord pursuant to the provisions hereof with respect to the Offered Space designated in the Offer Notice, Landlord shall be under no further obligation whatsoever respect to such space. In order to send the Offer Notice, Landlord does not need to have negotiated a lease with any particular Proposed Tenant but may merely have determined on what basis it will market the Offered Space to Proposed Tenants. Tenant must make its decision with respect to the Offered Space as long as it has received a description of such material economic terms. (c) Tenant must accept all Offered Space offered by Landlord at any one time if it desires to accept any of such Offered Space and may not exercise its right with respect to only part of such space. In addition, if Landlord desires to lease more than just the Offered Space to one tenant. Landlord may offer to Tenant pursuant to the terms hereof all such space which Landlord desires to lease, and Tenant must exercise its rights hereunder with respect to all such space and may not insist on receiving an offer for just the Offered Space. (d) If Tenant at any time declines any Offered Space offered by Landlord, Tenant shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived all further rights under this Addendum, and Landlord shall be free to lease the Offered Space to any Proposed Tenant including on terms which may be less favorable to Landlord than those set forth in the Offer Notice. (e) Tenant shall not have the benefit of the foregoing right of first offer if Tenant is in Default at the time the Offer Notice is to be sent, or if at such time any circumstance exists which, with the giving of notice or the passage of time, or both, would constitute a Default. The period of time Tenant s right of first offer may be exercised shall not be extended or enlarged by reason of Tenant s inability to exercise such right because of the provisions of this paragraph. 8. Option to Extend . The addendum to the Lease captioned Option to Extend Addendum is hereby deleted in its entirety. Landlord hereby grants to Tenant the options to extend the term of this Lease for the periods (the Option Periods (1) from December 1, 2010 to November 30, 2015, and (2) from December 1, 2015 to November 30, 2020, under the following terms and conditions.

 First Amendment to Lease Page 3 

 (24) months prior to the date (the Last Exercise Date that the applicable Option Period would commence, but not earlier than thirty (30) months prior to the date that the applicable Option Period would commence. If proper notification of the exercise of an option is not given and/or received, such option shall automatically expire. The renewal options may only be exercised consecutively. Failure to exercise an option terminates that option and all subsequent options. Tenant acknowledges that because of the importance to Landlord of knowing no later than the Last Exercise Date whether or not Tenant will exercise the option, the failure of Tenant to notify Landlord by the Last Exercise Date will conclusively be presumed an election by Tenant not to exercise the option. Upon the exercise of an option to extend, both parties shall execute an amendment to the Lease evidencing the renewal thereof and setting forth the new Base Rent (as determined pursuant to Section 8(c) below) no later than eighteen (18) months prior to the date that the applicable Option Period would commence. (b) Tenant shall have no right to exercise an option (i) if Tenant is in Default. or (ii) if during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the exercise of the option, three (3) or more Defaults have occurred which were not cured within any applicable notice or grace period. The period of time within which an option may be exercised shall not be extended or enlarged by reason of Tenant s inability to exercise an option because of the provisions of this paragraph. (c) If an option to extend is exercised, all of the terms and conditions of this Lease shall apply, except that (i) Landlord shall not be required to grant any allowance or perform any tenant improvement work in the Premises, and (ii) for each Option Period, Base Rent shall be adjusted to equal fair market rent. After an option to renew is exercised, Landlord and Tenant shall negotiate in good faith to determine the Base Rent for the applicable Option Period. If agreement cannot be reached within thirty (30) days, then Landlord and Tenant shall each, no later than sixty (60) days after the date of exercise of the option, make a reasonable determination of the fair market rental for the Premises for the applicable Option Period and submit such determination, in writing, to arbitration in accordance with the following provisions: (i) No later than ninety (90) days after the option to renew is exercised, Landlord and Tenant shall each select an industrial leasing broker to act as an arbitrator. The two arbitrators so appointed shall, no later then one hundred twenty (120) days after the option to renew is exercised, select a third mutually acceptable industrial leasing broker to act as a third arbitrator. (ii) The three arbitrators, acting by a majority, shall no later then one hundred fifty (150) days after the option to renew is exercised, determine the actual fair market rental for the Premises for the Option Period. The decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be binding on the parties. The fair market rental determination of Landlord or Tenant which is closest to the fair market rental as determined by the arbitrators shall be the Base Rent for the Option Period. 
 First Amendment to Lease Page 4 

 (iii) If either of the parties fails to appoint an arbitrator within the period required by this Addendum, the arbitrator timely appointed shall determine the Base Rent for the Option Period. (iv) The entire cost of such arbitration shall be paid by the party whose fair market rental submission is not selected. (d) The renewal options set forth herein are personal to Tenant, cannot be assigned or exercised by anyone other than Tenant and only while Tenant is in full possession of the Premises and without the intention of thereafter assigning or subletting. 9. Guaranty . Concurrently with the execution hereof, Tenant shall cause Darlene M. Ryan to execute and deliver to Landlord a guaranty in the form of Exhibit C attached hereto and made a part hereof, which shall supersede the Original Guaranty. 10. Commission Agreement .
