 Acquisitions 
 On July 18, 2022, BD completed the acquisition of Parata Systems Parata ), an innovative provider of pharmacy automation solutions, for total cash consideration of 1.548 billion. Since the acquisition date, financial results for Parata's product offerings are being reported within results for the Medical segment s Medication Management Solutions unit. Additional information regarding this acquisition is contained in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Divestitures 
 Surgical Instrumentation Platform 
 In August 2023, BD completed the sale of the Interventional segment s Surgical Instrumentation platform pursuant to a definitive agreement that was signed in June 2023. BD recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately 268 million, which was recorded as a component of Other operating (income) expense, net in fiscal year 2023. The historical financial results for the Surgical Instrumentation platform have not been classified as a discontinued operation. Additional information regarding this divestiture is contained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 Spin-Off of Diabetes Care 
 On April 1, 2022, BD completed the separation and distribution of Embecta Corp. Embecta ), formerly BD's Diabetes Care business, into a separate, publicly-traded company. The historical results of the Diabetes Care business (previously included in BD s Medical segment), as well as interest expense related to indebtedness incurred by Embecta prior to the spin-off date, have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods prior to the spin-off date of April 1, 2022. Additional disclosures regarding our spin-off of the Diabetes Care business are provided in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 International Operations 
 BD s products are manufactured and sold worldwide. For reporting purposes, we organize our operations outside the United States as follows: EMEA (which includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa); Greater Asia (which includes countries in Greater China, Japan, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Korea, and Australia and New Zealand); Latin America (which includes Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and South America); and Canada. BD has manufacturing operations outside the United States in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, China, Dominican Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Geographic information with respect to BD s operations is included under the heading Geographic Information in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 Foreign economic conditions and exchange rate fluctuations have caused the profitability related to foreign revenues to fluctuate more than the profitability related to domestic revenues. BD believes its activities in some countries outside the United States involve greater risk than its domestic business due to the factors cited herein. See further discussion of these risks in Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Distribution 
 BD s products are marketed and distributed in the United States and internationally through independent distribution channels, as well as directly to hospitals and other healthcare related institutions by BD and independent sales representatives. BD uses acute care, non-acute care, laboratory and drug wholesaler distributors to broadly support our overall disposable product demand from our end user customers in the United States, while our capital equipment is mostly sold direct to our end user customers. In international markets, products are distributed either directly or through distributors, with the practice varying by country.

 Order backlog is not usually material to BD s business inasmuch as orders for BD products generally are received and filled on a current basis. BD s worldwide sales are not generally seasonal, with the exception of certain medical devices in the Medication Delivery Solutions business unit, and flu diagnostic products in the Integrated Diagnostic Systems business unit, both of which relate to seasonal diseases such as influenza. BD operates consolidated distribution facilities globally in order to better service its customers, optimize logistics, lower facilities costs and reduce finished goods inventory levels. 
 Raw Materials and Components 
 BD purchases many different types of raw materials and components, including plastics, glass, metals, textiles, paper products, agricultural products, electronic and mechanical sub-assemblies and various biological, chemical and petrochemical products. BD seeks to ensure continuity of supply by securing multiple options for sourcing. However, there are situations where raw materials and components are only available from one supplier, which are referred to as sole sourced. The use of sole sourced materials and components may be due to sourcing of proprietary and/or patented technology and processes that are intended to provide a unique market differentiation to our product. In other cases, while a raw material or component can be sourced from multiple manufacturers, only one supplier is qualified due to quality assurance, cost or other considerations. In order to provide alternate sources, BD must complete a rigorous qualification process, which most often includes completion of regulatory registration and approval. If clinical trials are not required, this qualification process can take 3-18 months depending on the criticality of the change. When clinical trials are required, this process may lengthen the qualification phase from one to three years. BD continuously assesses its sole sourced raw materials and components, and maintains business continuity plans with its suppliers. BD s continuity plans may include securing secondary supply with alternate suppliers, qualification of alternate manufacturing facilities, maintaining contingency stock, internal development of supply and establishment of technology escrow accounts. While BD works closely with its suppliers, no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful, and there may be events that cause supply interruption, reduction or termination that adversely impact BD s ability to manufacture and sell certain products. See further discussion of the risks related to the supply chain and raw materials in Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Research and Development 
 BD conducts its research and development R D activities at its operating units and across global enterprise centers of excellence located in the United States, India, China, Singapore and Ireland. The majority of BD s R D activities are conducted in North America. Outside North America, BD has a significant R D presence in Greater Asia and Europe. BD also collaborates with certain universities, medical centers and other entities on R D programs and retains individual consultants and partners to support its efforts in specialized fields. 
 Intellectual Property and Licenses 
 BD owns significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights and trademarks in the United States and other countries. BD is also licensed under domestic and foreign patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights and trademarks owned by others. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to BD s business. BD believes, however, that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to BD s business as a whole, or to any business segment. 
 Competition 
 BD operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace. Technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology, the regulatory environment of medical products is becoming more complex and vigorous, and economic conditions have resulted in a challenging market. Companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology field. Some are more specialized than BD with respect to particular markets, and some have greater financial resources than BD. New companies have entered the field, particularly in the areas of molecular diagnostics, non-traditional point of care and at-home testing, safety-engineered devices and in the life sciences.

 Additionally, established companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology area. Other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well. Acquisitions and collaborations by and among companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment. In addition, the entry into the market of low-cost manufacturers has created increased pricing pressures. BD competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors, including price, quality, innovation, service, reputation, distribution and promotion. The impact of these factors on BD s competitive position varies among BD s various product offerings. In order to remain competitive in the industries in which it operates and to boost supply reliability and productivity, BD continues to make investments in R D, quality management, quality improvement, product innovation, manufacturing and supply chain. See further discussion of the risks relating to competition in the medical technology industry in Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Market Access and Third-Party Reimbursement 
 BD s customers and the patients our customers serve rely on public and private payers to reimburse and/or cover some or all the cost of procedures, products and services. BD actively engages with the payer community, medical societies and other stakeholders in order to navigate market access trends and appropriately communicate value propositions for a broad range of BD medical technologies. However, BD has no direct control over payer decision-making with respect to coverage and payment levels for BD products. 
 The manner and level of reimbursement is determined at the payer s discretion and may depend on a variety of factors, including but not limited to site of care, procedure(s) performed, patient diagnosis, the device(s) and/or drug(s) utilized, available budget, health equity, beneficiary access or a combination of these factors. The providers that we serve are also evaluating changes in the healthcare reimbursement landscape and coverage elements leading to their own decision-making on what they will ultimately pay for various medical technologies or procedures, which could positively or negatively impact sales of BD products in any given country for any given product at any given time. 
 Vertical integration of health systems has created a concentrated market among commercial payers in the U.S. and there is an increased focus globally on payment policies that serve to control healthcare spending while also rewarding quality and patient outcomes. Governments around the world continue to consider and transition to value-based payment reforms similar to the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) that would drive improved value and quality- and resource-based reimbursement. For example, the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services (CMS) established a 2030 goal of transitioning all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries to a care relationship to ensure the agency s accountability of quality and cost of care. Whether these changes are driven by legislative efforts, strategic alliances or market conditions, the global landscape continues to enhance cost control efforts through pay for performance mechanisms and bidding and tender policies that focus on quality and performance. 
 Examining reimbursement and continually assessing the broader healthcare funding landscape is a strategic consideration in the development and marketing of medical technology. Advancing coding, coverage and payment strategies reduce barriers to adoption, improve affordability and are critical to ensuring patient and provider access to medical technologies. Market access strategies are also critical in ensuring commercial priorities are meeting the demand for critical healthcare needs globally and locally. 
 Regulation 
 General 
 BD's operations are global and are affected by complex state, federal and international laws relating to healthcare, environmental protection, occupational health and safety, antitrust, anti-corruption, marketing, fraud and abuse (including anti-kickback and false claims laws), export control, product safety and efficacy, employment, privacy and other areas. 
 BD s medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA and various other federal and state agencies, as well as by foreign governmental agencies. These agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, 
 5 

Table of Contents 

 labeling, advertising, marketing and distribution, and market surveillance of BD s medical products. The scope of the activities of these agencies, particularly in the Europe, Japan, Latin America, and Asia Pacific regions in which BD operates, has been increasing. 
 BD actively maintains Quality Systems that establish standards for its product design, manufacturing, and distribution processes, in accordance with ISO standards and FDA regulation. Prior to marketing or selling most of its products, BD must secure authorization from the FDA and counterpart foreign regulatory agencies. Following the introduction of a product, these agencies engage in periodic reviews and inspections of BD s quality systems, as well as product performance and advertising and promotional materials. These regulatory controls, as well as any changes in agency policies, can affect the time and cost associated with the development, introduction and continued availability of new and existing products. Where possible, BD anticipates these factors in its product development and planning processes. These agencies have the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against BD, such as product recalls, product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions, for violations of applicable requirements. BD also undertakes voluntary compliance actions, such as voluntary recalls. 
 BD also is subject to various federal and state laws, and laws outside the United States, concerning healthcare fraud and abuse (including false claims laws and anti-kickback laws), global anti-corruption, transportation, safety and health, and customs and exports. Many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years. This is part of a general trend toward increased regulation and enforcement activity within and outside the United States. 
 In addition, the federal government has enacted the Sunshine Act provisions requiring BD to publicly report gifts and payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals. Countries outside the United States have enacted similar local laws requiring medical device companies to report transfers of value to healthcare providers licensed in those countries. Failure to comply with these laws could result in a range of fines, penalties and/or other sanctions. 
 Consent Decree with FDA 
 Our infusion pump organizational unit is operating under an amended consent decree entered into by CareFusion with the FDA in 2007. CareFusion s consent decree with the FDA is related to its Alaris SE infusion pumps. In February 2009, CareFusion and the FDA amended the consent decree (the Consent Decree to include all infusion pumps manufactured by or for CareFusion 303, Inc., the organizational unit that manufactures and sells BD Alaris infusion pumps in the United States. The Consent Decree does not apply to intravenous administration sets and accessories. 
 Following an inspection that began in March 2020 of our Medication Management Systems facility (CareFusion 303, Inc.) in San Diego, California, the FDA issued to BD a Form 483 Notice (the Form 483 Notice that contains a number of observations of non-conformance with the FDA s quality system regulations. In December 2021, the FDA issued to CareFusion 303, Inc. a letter of non-compliance with respect to the Consent Decree (the Non-Compliance Letter stating that, among other things, it had determined that certain of BD s corrective actions with respect to the Form 483 Notice appeared to be adequate, some were still in progress such that adequacy could not be determined yet, and certain others were not adequate (e.g., complaint handling and corrective and preventive actions CAPA ), design verification and medical device reporting). Per the terms of the Non-Compliance Letter, CareFusion 303, Inc. provided the FDA with a proposed comprehensive corrective action plan and has retained an independent expert to conduct periodic audits of the CareFusion 303, Inc. infusion pump facilities through 2025. CareFusion 303, Inc. will update its corrective action plan to address any observations that may arise during the course of these audits. The FDA s review of the items raised in the Form 483 Notice and Non-Compliance Letter remains ongoing, and no assurances can be given regarding further action by the FDA as a result of the observations, including but not limited to action pursuant to the Consent Decree, or that corrective actions proposed by CareFusion 303, Inc. will be adequate to address these observations. Additionally, we cannot currently predict the amount of additional monetary investment that will be incurred to resolve this matter or the matter s ultimate impact on our business.

Table of Contents 

 The Consent Decree authorizes the FDA, in the event of any violations in the future, to order us to cease manufacturing and distributing infusion pumps, recall products and take other actions. We may be required to pay damages of 15,000 per day per violation if we fail to comply with any provision of the Consent Decree, up to 15 million per year. 
 We may be obligated to pay more costs in the future because, among other things, the FDA may determine that we are not fully compliant with the Consent Decree and Non-Compliance Letter and therefore impose penalties under the Consent Decree, and/or we may also be subject to future proceedings and litigation relating to the matters addressed in the Consent Decree, including, but not limited to, additional fines, penalties, other monetary remedies, and expansion of the terms of the Consent Decree. As of September 30, 2023, we do not believe that a loss is probable in connection with the Consent Decree, and accordingly, we have no accruals associated with compliance with the Consent Decree. 
 As previously disclosed, on July 21, 2023, BD received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for its updated BD Alaris Infusion System, which enables both remediation and a return to market for the BD Alaris Infusion System. This clearance covers updated hardware features for Point-of-Care Unit (PCU), large volume pumps, syringe pumps, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pumps, respiratory monitoring and auto-identification modules. It also covers a new BD Alaris Infusion System software version with enhanced cybersecurity, along with interoperability features that enable smart, connected care with electronic medical record systems. To address all open recalls and ensure all devices at customer sites are running the most recent version of the BD Alaris Infusion System Software, all of the current BD Alaris Infusion System devices in the U.S. market will be remediated or replaced with the updated 510(k) cleared version over the next several years. 
 FDA Warning Letter 
 On January 11, 2018, BD received a Warning Letter from the FDA with respect to our former BD Preanalytical Systems ("PAS") unit, citing certain alleged violations of quality system regulations and of law. The Warning Letter states that, until BD resolves the outstanding issues covered by the Warning Letter, the FDA will not approve any premarket submissions for Class III devices to which the non-conformances are reasonably related or grant requests for certificates to foreign governments. BD has worked closely with the FDA and implemented corrective actions to address the quality management system concerns identified in the Warning Letter. In March 2020, the FDA conducted a subsequent inspection of PAS, which it classified as Voluntary Action Indicated, which means the FDA will not take or recommend any administrative or regulatory action as a result of the unit s response to the observations associated with the quality management concerns in the inspection. BD continues to work with the FDA to generate additional clinical evidence and file 510(k)s as remaining commitments associated with the Warning Letter. In January 2022, BD received FDA clearance for its BD Vacutainer ACD Blood Collection Tubes used in immunohematology. In July 2023, BD received FDA clearance for its BD Vacutainer Trace Element K2EDTA and Serum Blood Collection Tubes. The FDA review of these remaining commitments is ongoing, and no assurances can be given regarding further action by the FDA as a result of these commitments, including but not limited to action pursuant to the Warning Letter. 
 Ethylene Oxide/Consent Order - Covington, Georgia, USA 
 On October 28, 2019, BD entered into a consent order with the Environmental Protection Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (the EPD ), following the filing of a complaint and motion for temporary restraining order by the EPD seeking to enjoin BD from continuing sterilization operations at its Covington, Georgia facility. Under the terms of the consent order, which has been amended two times upon mutual agreement of BD and EPD, BD voluntarily agreed to a nu mber of operational changes at its Covington and Madison, Georgia facilities, as well as at its distribution center in Covington, designed to further reduce ethylene oxide emissions, including but not limited to operating at a reduced capacity until successful implementation of fugitive emission control technology, ongoing ambient air monitoring and operational controls at such facilities. Following submission of data relating to the implementation of these operational changes, BD was permitted to return to normal operations in December 2021 at its facilities in Georgia in accordance with the operating conditions set forth in its permit applications, including a condition to continue

 ambient air monitoring. The final air permits for the Covington and Madison facilities were issued by the EPD on May 5, 2023. 
 At a broader level, there is increased focus on the use and emission of ethylene oxide by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state environmental regulatory agencies. Additional regulatory requirements associated with the use and emission of ethylene oxide may be imposed in the future, either domestically or outside the U.S. Ethylene oxide is the most frequently used sterilant for medical devices and healthcare products in the U.S., and in certain cases is the only option to sterilize critical medical device products for the safe administration to patients. This increased regulation could require BD or sterilization service providers, including providers used by BD, to temporarily suspend operations to install additional emissions control technology, limit the use of ethylene oxide or take other actions, which would impact BD s operations and further reduce the available capacity to sterilize medical devices and healthcare products, and could also result in additional costs. To this end, BD has proactively installed fugitive emissions controls at our facilities in East Columbus, NE and Sandy, UT, though such controls are not currently required by law. A few states have filed lawsuits to require additional air quality controls and expand limitations on the use of ethylene oxide at sterilization facilities. For example, in December 2020, the State of New Mexico filed a lawsuit seeking a temporary restraining order and a preliminary and permanent injunction against a major medical device sterilizer, which sterilizes certain of our surgery products, to reduce ethylene oxide emissions associated with their sterilization process. On April 13, 2023, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA published a proposed revision to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Ethylene Oxide Emissions Standards for Sterilization Facilities and a Pesticide Registration Review; Proposed Interim Decision and Draft Risk Assessment Addendum for Ethylene Oxide. BD submitted comments on these proposed regulations. We cannot predict what any final regulations adopted by the EPA may require and therefore we are not able to assess the impact they may have on our sterilization facilities, on the third-party sterilization facilities that BD utilizes and our operations more generally. It is possible that there may also be increased regulation outside the U.S. If any existing regulatory requirements or any such proceedings or rulemaking result in the suspension, curtailment or interruption of sterilization operations at BD or at medical device sterilizers used by BD, or otherwise limit the availability of third-party sterilization capacity, this could interrupt or otherwise adversely impact production of certain of our products or lead to civil litigation or other claims against BD. BD has business continuity plans in place to mitigate the impact of any such disruptions, although these plans may not be able to fully offset such impact, for the reasons noted above. 
 For further discussion of risks relating to the regulations to which we are subject, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Human Capital Management 
 At BD, our associates are guided by our Purpose of advancing the world of health TM and The BD WAY, our cultural foundation that encompasses our core values, servant leadership expectations and the mindset we bring to our work. Our associates are empowered to contribute their unique ideas and experiences to fuel innovation and improve patient outcomes. As of September 30, 2023, BD is comprised of approximately 73,000 associates located in over 62 countries. Attracting, developing and retaining talented people in all different functions is crucial to executing our strategy and our ability to compete effectively in a highly competitive medical technology industry. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent depends on several factors, including compensation and benefits, talent development and career opportunities, and our unique culture. To that end, we continually invest in our associates to be an employer of choice. 
 Inclusion, Diversity Equity 
 For BD, diversity refers to the practice of including the many communities and backgrounds that make up our Company and the world we serve. Diversity reflects our culture of inclusion, welcoming people of all different ethnicities, abilities, cultures, genders, religions, ages, sexual orientation, identity, experiences and tenure, as well as people with diverse opinions, perspectives, lifestyles, and ideas. Our associates possess a broad range of beliefs and experiences which have helped BD achieve our leadership position in the medical technology industry and the global marketplace. A key component of our journey to continually build a better BD is our commitment to global inclusion, diversity and equity ID E ). We believe this commitment,

Table of Contents 

 coupled with our purpose and culture, allows us to better understand patient and customer needs and develop innovative technologies to meet those needs. 
 Each year, we establish annual corporate ID E goals focused on equity and inclusion. In addition, our executive leaders serve as sponsors to our nine global Associate Resource Groups ARGs that enable all associates to contribute their talents and skills to help advance opportunity for everyone. Our ARGs are empowered to set strategic goals aligned with their mission and centered around efforts to advance our company, local communities and each BD associates career, while fostering a sense of belonging, allyship, and professional development opportunities. 
 Externally, we are building on our existing momentum and remain involved in industry ID E efforts with the Advanced Medical Technology Association AdvaMed to improve diversity in the medical technology industry. We remain committed to sustaining meaningful, long-term strategic partnerships and programs to help address equitable access to care and advance the health of our communities around the world. This work impacts under-resourced communities, both in developed and underdeveloped countries. Through the BD Helping Build Healthy Communities initiative, which is funded by BD and the BD Foundation, and implemented jointly by Direct Relief and the National Association of Community Health Centers, we have provided 52 awards to community health centers in 20 states since 2013, with a total commitment of 21.7 million in cash and product donations to advance health equity in the U.S. 
 BD also has a longstanding history of associate volunteerism that is enabled through our public-private partnerships and collaborations with non-government organizations. We sponsor volunteer service trips and other meaningful volunteer opportunities to help strengthen health systems and enable an environment that can maintain critical competences and resources needed to improve delivery of care. Associates are empowered to serve organizations and causes that are important to them in their local communities. This includes a matching gift program, paid time off to volunteer, and an award program to give grants to non-profit organizations in honor of associates who engage in exceptional volunteer efforts. 
 These collective efforts have garnered recognition from respected organizations across the country, including Disability:IN s Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion, Bloomberg s Gender Equality Index, 
 and Diversity Inc. s Noteworthy Companies award, as well as awards for LGBTQ and women inclusion. In addition, we were awarded Best Code of Conduct and ranked a top ten company in the U.S. Transparency Awards by Labrador and named to the 100 Best Corporate Citizens list by 3BL, placing in the top two in the healthcare equipment and services industry. While we celebrate the recognition we have received, we remain committed and accountable to the work required within our company and beyond our corporate walls to build and maintain equity, acceptance, and accessibility for everyone.

Associate Growth and Development 
 At BD we hold ourselves and each other accountable for learning and growing every day, which underscores our growth mindset culture. Our commitment to continuous improvement helps us become the best version of ourselves and we invest significant resources to develop talent with the right capabilities to deliver the growth and innovation needed to support our strategy and customers, both for today and for the future. Our enhanced Strategic Organizational Planning process is focused on building the organizational capabilities required in the years to come, and we offer associates and managers a robust offering of tools to help in their personal and professional development, including career development plans, mentoring programs, and in-house learning opportunities, including BD University, our in-house continuing education curriculum delivered through a "leaders-as-teachers" approach. With a deeply-rooted practice of investing in our next generation of leaders, BD offers associates a number of leadership development programs, designed to enable our BD culture, cultivate leadership, and develop key organizational skills, and are delivered through an omnichannel approach that includes digital, virtual, and in person learning opportunities to help our associates learn when and how they like. Our robust manager curriculum is designed to help our more than 8,000 people managers become more effective servant leaders that create work environments that facilitate growth and success. We have also applied our growth mindset philosophy to our performance management approach with an increased focus on continuous learning and development to help us all achieve our best. 
 Associate Engagement 
 As we strive to be an employer of choice, we believe it is critical that our associates are informed, engaged, and can provide feedback. We communicate frequently and transparently with our associates through a variety of communication methods, including video and written communications, town hall meetings, associate surveys, and our company intranet, and acknowledge individual contributions to BD through a number of rewards and recognition award programs. 
 Our efforts to seek ongoing feedback help us better understand what we are doing well and how we can improve the associate experience. In addition to encouraging a speak-up culture between associates, their managers, and cross-functional teams, we conduct employee engagement surveys to provide all associates with an opportunity to share their perspective and we take appropriate action in response. 
 In addition to helping associates stay engaged, we also work to foster and reinforce an inclusive culture where diverse perspectives are valued. This year, our ARGs continued to host company-wide dialogues and panel sessions to advance our business and cultural priorities and engage and foster conversations and awareness among associates on timely topics of racial injustice, career progression, social constructs, LGBTQIA+ education and equity, eliminating bias, healthcare inequity and access, and mental/emotional well-being during turbulent times. We continue to engage in discussions as a company on intersectionality, inclusion and belonging. 
 Compensation, Benefits and Well-being 
 Our total rewards program is designed to attract and retain top talent and to incentivize performance aligned with our business strategy and values. We offer a comprehensive total rewards program aimed at promoting overall well-being in support of the varying health, home-life, and financial needs of our diverse and global associates. Through our integrated global approach to well-being, we provide support, education, and resources to empower associates across all geographies to prioritize their well-being and build resilience in the physical, emotional, financial, and social areas of life. To enable associates to take action in support of their overall well-being, our total rewards packages (which vary by location) include market-competitive pay, broad-based stock grants and bonuses, healthcare benefits and retirement savings plans, paid time off and family leave, flexible work schedules, on-site health and fitness centers, free physicals and flu vaccinations, well-being education and resources, employee assistance programs and other mental health support and resources. Each year we review and implement program enhancements and investments to ensure our benefits are inclusive and representative of the needs of BD associates and their families. Additionally, over the last several years in the

 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 An investment in BD involves a variety of risks and uncertainties. The following describes some of the material risks that could adversely affect BD s business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. We may also be adversely impacted by other risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. 
 Business, Economic and Industry Risks 
 Global economic conditions, including inflation and supply chain disruptions, could continue to adversely affect our operations. 
 General global economic downturns and macroeconomic trends, including heightened inflation, capital market volatility, interest rate and currency rate fluctuations, and economic slowdown or recession, may result in unfavorable conditions that could negatively affect demand for our products and services, or the prices we can charge for our products, disrupt our supply chain, impair our ability to produce our products, increase borrowing costs and exacerbate some of the other risks that affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, general economic conditions may impact the healthcare industry, including 
 11 

Table of Contents 

 reductions in capital spending, changes in the delivery of healthcare services and increasing labor disputes, which could in turn affect demand for our products and services. Both domestic and international markets experienced inflationary pressures in fiscal year 2023 and we expect inflation to persist in the future but at lower levels than in fiscal year 2023. In addition, the Federal Reserve in the U.S. and other central banks in various countries have raised, and may again raise, interest rates in response to concerns about inflation, which, coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets, may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty and heightening these risks. Interest rate increases or other government actions taken to reduce inflation could also result in recessionary pressures in many parts of the world. Furthermore, currency exchange rates have been especially volatile in the recent past, and these currency fluctuations have affected, and may continue to affect, the reported value of our assets and liabilities, as well as our cash flows. In addition, we have previously experienced delays in collecting government receivables in certain countries due to economic conditions, and we may experience similar delays in the future in these and other countries or regions experiencing financial problems. 
 We have also experienced, and may continue to experience, significant challenges in our global supply chain, including shortages in supply, or disruptions or delays in shipments, of certain materials or components used in our products, and related price increases. While to date, we have been able to manage the challenges associated with these delays and shortages without significant disruption to our business, no assurance can be given that these efforts will continue to be successful. 
 Our international operations subject us to certain business risks. 
 A substantial amount of our sales come from our operations outside the U.S., and we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in foreign markets, especially in emerging markets. Our foreign operations subject us to certain commercial, political and financial risks. In addition to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange (discussed above), our business in these foreign markets is subject to changing political, social, and geopolitical conditions, such as the evolving situations in Ukraine, the Middle East and Asia, including any political instability resulting from war, terrorism, insurrections and civil unrest, and changing economic conditions in these markets, such as inflation, deflation, interest rate volatility and credit availability. Additionally, a number of factors, including U.S. relations with the governments of the foreign countries in which we operate, changes to international trade agreements and treaties, changes in tax laws and regulations, economic sanctions, export controls, restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders, tariffs and other increases in trade protectionism and barriers to market participation, or the weakening or loss of certain intellectual property protection rights in some countries, may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Foreign regulatory requirements, including those related to the testing, authorization, and labeling of products and import or export licensing requirements, could affect the availability of our products in these markets. In addition to these broader market conditions, our operations may also be impacted by a variety of local factors, such as competition from local companies, local product preferences and requirements, and changes in local healthcare payment systems and healthcare delivery systems. We also experience longer payment terms for account receivables in foreign jurisdictions than we experience in the U.S., and we face increased difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing our foreign operations. 
 The success of our operations outside the U.S. also depends, in part, on our ability to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to, among other things, our production facilities and sales and distribution networks. These and other factors may adversely impact our ability to pursue our growth strategy in these markets. 
 In addition, our international operations are governed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws. Global enforcement of anti-corruption laws has increased substantially in recent years, with more enforcement proceedings by U.S. and foreign governmental agencies and the imposition of significant fines and penalties. While we have implemented policies and procedures relating to compliance with these laws, our international operations, which often involve customer relationships with foreign governments, create the risk that there may be unauthorized payments or offers of payments made by employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors. We are also subject to certain U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that restrict BD from transacting business with, or making investments in, certain countries, governments, entities and individuals subject to U.S. or foreign economic sanctions or export restrictions. Any alleged or actual violations of these laws may subject us to government investigations and significant criminal

 or civil sanctions and other liabilities, and negatively affect our reputation and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 The medical technology industry is very competitive. 
 We are a global company that faces significant competition from a wide range of existing competitors and new market entrants. These include large medical device companies with multiple product lines, some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we do, as well as firms which are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets or product lines. Non-traditional entrants, such as technology companies, are also entering into the healthcare industry and some may have greater financial and other resources than we do. We face competition across all our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold on the basis of product features, clinical or economic outcomes, product quality, availability, price, services and other factors. Our ability to compete is also impacted by changing customer preferences and requirements, including increased focus on products using materials of concern and demand for more environmentally friendly products, and for products incorporating digital capabilities, as well as changes in the ways healthcare services are delivered (including the transition of more care from acute to non-acute settings and increased focus on chronic disease management). The shift of care from acute to non-acute settings may also place financial pressure on hospitals and broader healthcare systems that could result in less demand for our products and services. Cost containment efforts by governments and the private sector are also resulting in increased emphasis on products that reduce costs, improve clinical results and expand patient access. Changes in regulatory or market standards, including without limitation cybersecurity requirements, often require significant investment to maintain compliance to relevant standards. Our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we meet these changing market and regulatory demands in terms of our product offerings and go-to-market approaches. 
 The medical technology industry is also subject to rapid technological change, discovery and frequent product introductions. The development of new or improved products, processes or technologies by other companies (such as needle-free injection technology or novel medical therapies) that provide better features, pricing, clinical outcomes or economic value may render our current products or subsequently developed products obsolete or less competitive. In some instances, competitors, including pharmaceutical companies, also offer (or are attempting to develop) alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device. Lower cost producers have also created pricing pressure, particularly in developing markets. 
 The medical technology industry has also experienced a significant amount of consolidation, resulting in companies with greater scale and market presence than BD. Traditional distributors are also manufacturers of medical devices, providing another source of competition. In addition, healthcare systems and other providers are consolidating, resulting in greater purchasing power for these companies. As a result, competition among medical device suppliers to provide goods and services has increased. Group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have also served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, which has led to downward pricing pressure for medical device suppliers. Further consolidation in the industry could intensify competition among medical device suppliers and exert additional pressure on the demand for and prices of our products. 
 We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk. 
 A substantial amount of our revenue is derived from international operations, and we anticipate that a significant portion of our future sales will continue to come from outside the U.S. The revenues we report with respect to our operations outside the U.S. have been and may continue to be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which are caused by a number of factors, including changes in a country's political and economic policies and inflationary conditions. Furthermore, currency exchange rates have been especially volatile in the recent past, and these currency fluctuations have affected, and may continue to affect, the reported value of our assets and liabilities, as well as our cash flows. A discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we may attempt to address any impact is contained in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Any exchange rate hedging activities we engage in may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can effectively mitigate these risks.

 Market dynamics, changes in reimbursement practices and coverage policies and third-party payer cost containment measures could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold. 
 The sale of our products and market access to BD products and services depends, in part, on the healthcare funding landscape as well as how healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by public and private payers. Coverage policies and reimbursement levels can vary across the payer community globally, regionally, and locally, and may affect which products customers purchase, the market acceptance rate for new technologies and the prices customers are willing to pay for those products in a particular jurisdiction. Furthermore, any changes to the coverage or reimbursement landscape, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our products or result in denial of reimbursement for those products, which could adversely affect customer demand, or the price customers are willing to pay for such products. See Third-Party Reimbursement under Item 1. Business. 
 A global trend towards limiting growth of healthcare costs may also put industry-wide pressure on medical device or clinical diagnostic pricing. In the U.S., these include value-based purchasing and managed care arrangements. Governments in China and other countries are also using various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures, including increased use of competitive bidding and tenders as well as price regulation, such as volume-based procurement programs VoBP ), which have unfavorably impacted our revenues and may continue to impact our results of operations in certain countries. 
 Our future growth is dependent in part upon the development of new products, and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed. 
 A significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on innovation and new product development. New product development requires significant investment in R D, clinical trials and regulatory approvals. The results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to anticipate customer needs, innovate and develop new products and technologies, successfully complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the U.S. and abroad, manufacture products in a cost-effective manner, obtain appropriate intellectual property protections, and gain and maintain market acceptance of our products. In addition, patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product. There can be no assurance that any products now in development, or that we may seek to develop in the future, will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance. If we are unable to develop and launch new products, our ability to maintain or expand our market position in the markets in which we participate may be negatively impacted. Even if we successfully develop new products or enhancements or new generations of existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry or regulatory standards, or competitors innovations. 
 We are subject to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, including COVID-19, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The nature and extent of future impacts are highly uncertain and unpredictable. 
 We are subject to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, including COVID-19, which could result in reductions in the demand for certain of our products. While the direct impact of COVID-19 and many of the preventive measures moderated in FY2023, any resurgence of COVID-19, or the outbreak of any other epidemic or pandemic, or the reinstatement of similar preventive measures in the future could negatively impact the global economy and our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 In addition, public health crises and the resulting volatility in supply and demand may impact our global supply chain network, including shortages in supply or disruptions or delays in shipments, as well as price increases, of certain materials or components used in our products and increases in transportation costs. The COVID-19 pandemic changed the ways healthcare services are delivered due to budget constraints and staffing shortages, particularly shortages of nursing staff, which could impact the future demand for our products and services.

 The scope and duration of any future public health crisis, including the potential emergence of new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the pace at which government restrictions are imposed and lifted, the scope of additional actions taken to mitigate the spread of disease, global vaccination and booster rates, the speed and extent to which global markets and utilization rates for our products fully recover from the disruptions caused by such a public health crisis, and the impact of these factors on our business, financial condition and results of operations, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. 
 To the extent COVID-19 or other public health crises adversely affect our operations and global economic conditions more generally, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein. 
 Reductions in customers research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our business. 
 We sell products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government laboratories and private foundations. Research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions. A number of these customers are also dependent for their funding upon grants from U.S. government agencies, such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health and similar agencies in other countries. The level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable. The availability of governmental research funding may be adversely affected by economic conditions and governmental spending reductions, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. Any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products. 
 We need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive. 
 Our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives, key employees and other associates. Competition for experienced employees, particularly for persons with certain technical competencies in some geographies, can be a challenge. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical, manufacturing and distribution experience to operate our business successfully. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including how BD s compensation, benefits, work location, corporate culture and work environment compares with those offered by our competitors and other local employers. While there has been a slight improvement in what had been an intensely competitive labor market, there continues to be pressure on skilled labor in certain markets. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base has lead to, and may continue to lead to, increased costs, such as an increase in overtime necessary to meet demand and increased wages and benefit costs to attract and retain skilled employees, and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing and distribution facilities and overall business. If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and skilled employees, we could encounter operational disruptions or other negative consequences to our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 The military conflict between Russia and Ukraine may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The military conflict in Ukraine has increased global economic and political uncertainty. Furthermore, governments in the U.S., United Kingdom, and European Union have each imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia, and additional controls and sanctions could be enacted in the future. We continue to actively monitor the situation in Russia and Ukraine and assess its impact on our business, including our suppliers and customers. We have no manufacturing facilities or significant operations in Russia or Ukraine and as such, to date, the conflict has not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, it is possible that the conflict in Ukraine may escalate or expand, and the scope, extent and duration of the military action, current or future sanctions and resulting market and geopolitical disruptions could be significant. We cannot predict the impact the conflict may have on the global economy or our business, financial condition and operations in the future. The Russia and Ukraine conflict may also heighten the impact of other risks factors described herein. These potential effects could include but are not limited to increased inflation, volatility in prices for transportation, energy, commodities and other raw materials, constraints on the availability for us and our 
 15

 suppliers of commodities and other raw materials, including cobalt and energy sources, disruptions in the global supply chain, decreased demand for certain of our products, disruptions to our global technology infrastructure, including through cyberattacks, ransom attacks or cyber-intrusion, adverse changes in international trade policies and relations, increased exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, and constraints, volatility or disruptions in the credit and capital markets. 
 Operational Risks 
 Breaches or breakdowns of our information and technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
 We use a large number of information and technology systems to operate our business. We process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations, including sensitive personal or proprietary information. In addition, we rely on networks and services, including internet sites, cloud and software-as-a-service SaaS solutions, platform-as-a-service PaaS solutions, data hosting and processing facilities, tools and other hardware, software (including open-source software) and technical applications and platforms, including some that are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-party providers, to assist in conducting our business. Some of our products include information systems that collect data regarding patients and patient therapy on behalf of our customers and some connect to our systems for maintenance purposes. 
 Cyberattacks continue to increase in frequency, sophistication and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect for periods of time, especially as they relate to attacks on third-party providers or their vendors. Such attacks are often carried out by motivated and highly skilled actors, who are increasingly well-resourced. Our information systems, as well as those of various third parties on which we rely, have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, a variety of cybersecurity attacks including, but not limited to, unauthorized access, malicious code execution and/or phishing- attacks. Geopolitical events have also increased cybersecurity risks on a global basis. In this increasingly hostile environment, we, or our third-party providers, could suffer a loss or disclosure of certain business information (or information regarding third parties stored in our systems) due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches. These breaches and cyberattacks could result in our intellectual property and other confidential or proprietary information being accessed, destroyed or stolen, which could adversely affect our competitive position in the market. Likewise, we or our third-party providers could suffer disruption of our operations and other significant negative consequences, including increased costs for security measures or remediation, lost revenue, manufacturing challenges or disruption, diversion of management attention, reputational damage, litigation and damage to our relationships with vendors, business partners and customers. 
 Unauthorized tampering, adulteration or interference with our products may also create issues with product functionality that could result in a loss of data, risk to patient safety and product recalls or field actions. Cyberattacks could also result in unauthorized access to our systems and products, which could impact our compliance with privacy and other laws and regulations and could result in actions by regulatory bodies or civil litigation. 
 Cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated, frequent and adaptive. While we have made investments to address these threats and continue to dedicate significant resources to protect against unauthorized access of our systems and products, and we continue to work with government authorities and third-party providers to detect and reduce the risk of future cyber incidents, there can be no assurances that these protective measures will prevent future attacks that could have a material adverse impact on our business. 
 Cost volatility could adversely affect our operations . 
 Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by volatility in the cost of raw materials, components, labor, freight and energy that, in turn, increases the costs of producing and distributing our products. New laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy and transportation costs, as well as the costs of certain raw materials and components. In particular, we purchase supplies of resins, which are oil-based components used in the manufacture of certain products, and any significant increases in resin costs, whether due to inflationary pressure, supply constraints, regulatory changes 
 16

 or otherwise , could adversely impact future operating results. Increases in oil prices can also increase our packaging and transportation costs. The costs of raw materials, transportation, construction, services, and energy necessary for the production and distribution of our products continues to increase and be volatile. These prices may continue to fluctuate based on many factors beyond our control, including but not limited to, changes in general economic conditions, labor costs, transportation costs, competition and currency exchange rates. While we have implemented cost containment measures, selective price increases and taken other actions to mitigate these inflationary pressures in our supply chain, we may not be able to completely offset all the increases in our operational costs. 
 A reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials and components could adversely affect our operating results. 
 We purchase many different types of raw materials and components used in our products, some of which are not available from multiple sources. In addition, for quality assurance, cost-effectiveness and other reasons, certain raw materials and components are purchased from sole suppliers. The price and supply of these materials and components may be impacted or disrupted for reasons beyond our control, including supplier shutdowns, supplier capacity constraints, supplier insolvencies, labor disruptions, transportation delays, inflationary pricing pressures, work stoppages, labor shortages, extreme weather events, geopolitical developments, global economic uncertainty or downturns, sanctions and trade restrictions, and other governmental regulatory actions (such as in the area of materials of concern). We have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant challenges to our global transportation channels and other aspects of our global supply chain network, including to the cost and availability of energy, raw materials and components due to shortages and cost inflation. 
 While we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply and service, no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful. In addition, due to regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers, we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or without excessive cost. The termination, reduction or interruption in supply of these raw materials and components could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Interruption of our manufacturing or sterilization operations could adversely affect our business. 
 We have manufacturing sites all over the world. In some instances, however, the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants. Interruption to our manufacturing operations resulting from weather or natural disasters, regulatory requirements, equipment failure or other issues in our manufacturing process, could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products. In some instances, we may not be able to transition manufacturing to other BD sites or a third party to replace the lost production. A significant interruption of our manufacturing operations could result in lost revenues and damage to our relationships with customers. 
 In addition, many of our products require sterilization prior to sale, and we utilize both BD facilities and third parties for this process. In some instances, only a few facilities are qualified under applicable regulations to conduct this sterilization. To the extent we or our third-party providers are unable to sterilize our products, whether due to lack of capacity, availability of materials for sterilization (including cobalt), regulatory requirements or otherwise, we may be unable to transition sterilization to other sites or modalities in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. 
 At a broader level, there is increased focus on the use and emission of ethylene oxide by the EPA and state environmental regulatory agencies. Additional regulatory requirements associated with the use and emission of ethylene oxide for sterilization may be imposed in the future, both domestically and outside the U.S. In April 2023, the EPA published proposed regulations relating to commercial sterilizers. We cannot predict what any final regulations adopted by the EPA may require and therefore we are not able to assess the impact they may have on our sterilization facilities, on the third-party sterilization facilities that BD utilizes or on our operations more generally. This increased regulation could require BD or sterilization service providers, including providers used by BD, to temporarily suspend operations to install additional emissions control 
 17 

Table of Contents 

 technology, limit the use of ethylene oxide or take other actions, which would impact BD s operations and further reduce the available capacity to sterilize medical devices and healthcare products, and could also result in additional costs. If any existing regulatory requirements or any such regulatory actions or rulemaking result in the suspension or interruption of sterilization operations at BD or at medical device sterilizers used by BD, or otherwise limit the availability of third-party sterilization capacity, this could interrupt or otherwise adversely impact production of certain of our products or lead to civil litigation or other claims against BD. BD has business continuity plans in place to mitigate the impact of any such disruption, although these plans may not be able to fully offset such impact, for the reasons noted above. See Item 1. Business - Regulation for a discussion of the consent order BD entered into with the Environmental Protection Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the risk related to sterilization operations generally. 
 Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases GHG in the atmosphere may present risks to our business and operations. Extreme weather or other conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, wildfires or flooding, which may result from climate change could adversely impact our operations and supply chain, including the availability and cost of raw materials and components required for the operation of our business, and human capital issues for BD and companies within our supply chain. In addition, access to and pricing of certain natural resources, such as water, could impact our manufacturing operations. Such conditions could also result in physical damage to our products, plants and distribution centers, as well as the infrastructure and facilities of our suppliers and of hospitals, medical care facilities and other customers. 
 There has been increased focus by federal, international, state and local regulatory and legislative bodies to combat and/or limit the effects of climate change through a variety of means, including regulating greenhouse gas emissions (and requirements to disclose climate-related risks and metrics, including greenhouse gas emissions), policies mandating or promoting the use of renewable or zero-carbon energy and sustainability initiatives, and additional taxes on fuel and energy. If legislation or regulations are enacted or promulgated in the United States or in any other jurisdiction in which we do business that impose more stringent restrictions and requirements than our current legal or regulatory obligations, we and companies in our supply chain may experience increased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations, which could cause disruption in the sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Additionally, the impacts of climate change may further influence customer preferences and requirements, such as increased demand for products with lower environmental footprints, and for companies to produce and demonstrate progress against GHG reduction plans and targets. Failure to provide climate-friendly products or demonstrate GHG reductions could potentially result in loss of market share. 
 Legal, Quality and Regulatory Risks 
 We are subject to lawsuits. 
 We are or have been a defendant in a number of lawsuits, including, among others, purported class action lawsuits for alleged antitrust violations and violations of federal securities laws, product liability claims (which may involve lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multi-district litigation proceedings, including pending claims relating to our hernia repair implant products, surgical continence and pelvic organ prolapse products for women, vena cava filter products and implantable ports), and suits alleging patent infringement. We also are or have been subject to government subpoenas and civil investigative demands seeking information with respect to alleged violations of law, including in connection with federal and/or state healthcare programs (such as Medicare or Medicaid), federal contracting requirements and/or sales and marketing practices. A more detailed description of certain litigation to which we are a party is contained in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We could be subject to additional lawsuits, governmental investigations, subpoenas and civil investigative demands in the future. Any such lawsuits, governmental investigations, subpoenas and civil investigative demands could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could distract management from the operations of the business. 
 18 

Table of Contents 

 Reserves established for estimated losses with respect to legal proceedings do not represent an exact calculation of our actual liability, but instead represent our estimate of the probable loss at the time the reserve is established. Due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation and our underlying loss reserve estimates, additional reserves may be established or current reserves may be significantly increased from time-to-time. Also, in some instances, we are not able to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party. In view of these uncertainties, we could incur charges materially in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, excess liability insurance. Any such future charges, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. 
 With respect to certain litigation, we believe that some settlements and judgments, as well as legal defense costs, may be covered in whole or in part under applicable insurance policies with a limited number of insurance companies, or, in some circumstances, indemnification obligations owed to us by other parties. However, amounts recovered under these arrangements may be less than the stated coverage limits or less than otherwise expected and may not be adequate to cover damages and/or costs. In addition, there is no guarantee that insurers or other parties will pay claims or that coverage or indemnity will be otherwise available. Also, for certain product liability claims or lawsuits, BD does not maintain or has limited remaining insurance coverage, and we may not be able to obtain additional insurance on acceptable terms or at all that will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. 
 We are subject to extensive regulation. 
 Our operations are global and are affected by complex state, federal and international laws relating to healthcare, environmental protection, occupational health and safety, antitrust, anti-corruption, marketing, fraud and abuse (including anti-kickback and false claims laws), export control, product safety and efficacy, employment, privacy and other areas. Violations of these laws can result in criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines and, in some cases, exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Environmental laws, particularly with respect to climate change and the emission of greenhouse gases, are also becoming more stringent throughout the world, which may increase our costs of operations or necessitate closures of, or changes to, our manufacturing plants or processes or those of our suppliers, or result in liability to BD. The enactment of additional laws and reporting requirements in the future or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations may increase our compliance costs or otherwise adversely impact our operations and financial performance. 
 We are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, by comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Most of our products must receive clearance or approval from the FDA or counterpart regulatory agencies in other countries before they can be marketed or sold. The process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may require us to incur significant costs in terms of time and resources, and these costs have been increasing due to increased requirements from the FDA and comparable governing bodies for supporting data for submissions. The regulatory process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of our products. Governmental agencies may also impose new requirements regarding registration, including, but not limited to, labeling updates or changes to prohibited materials that require us to modify or re-register products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries. 
 Following the introduction of a product, these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance. Our failure to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices, adverse event reporting and other post market requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent the production, marketing or sale of our products and result in delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, warning letters or consent decrees, closure of manufacturing sites, import bans, seizures or recalls of products, civil or criminal sanctions and damage to our reputation. More stringent oversight by the FDA and other agencies in recent years has resulted in increased enforcement activity, which increases our compliance risk. 
 We are operating under an amended consent decree with the FDA, entered into by CareFusion in 2007 and amended in 2009, that affects our BD Alaris infusion pump business in the U.S. We are also currently 
 19 

Table of Contents 

 operating under a warning letter issued by the FDA. For more information regarding the consent decree and warning letter, see Regulation under Item 1. Business. 
 As previously disclosed, on July 21, 2023, BD received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for its updated BD Alaris Infusion System, which enables both remediation and a return to market for the BD Alaris Infusion System. In accordance with our commitments to the FDA, all of the current BD Alaris Infusion System devices in the U.S. market will be remediated or replaced with the updated 510(k) cleared version over the next several years. The overall timing and cost of replacement or remediation of the BD Alaris Infusion Systems and return to market in the U.S. may be impacted by, among other things, customer readiness, supply continuity, and our continued engagement with the FDA. 
 In addition, the European Union EU has adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation (the EU MDR and the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the EU IVDR ), each of which impose stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the area of clinical evidence requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. The EU MDR has been fully operational for previously approved self-certified medical devices since May 2021. In February 2023, the EU Parliament voted to extend the EU MDR transition timeline, which postpones application until 2027 for higher-risk Class III and implantable IIb devices (excluding WET devices) and 2028 for Class IIa, Class IIb (excluding Class IIb implantable non-WET devices), and Class I sterile devices or Class I devices with measuring function. This longer transition timeline applies only to devices that are transitioning to MDR and meet other specific conditions set out in the EU IVDR. The EU IVDR has been fully applicable for manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic medical devices since May 2022. Complying with and maintaining devices under these regulations requires us to incur significant expenditures. Additionally, the availability of EU notified body services certified to the new requirements is limited, which may delay the marketing approval for some of our products under the EU MDR. Any such delays, or any failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to EU conformity requirements. 
 We are also subject to complex and frequently changing privacy and data protection laws, rules and regulations in the U.S. as well as in all other regions where BD operates, regarding the collection, use, storage, transfer and other processing of personal information. These privacy, security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations, require changes to our policies, practices, and processes and in some cases impose restrictions on our use or storage of personal information. These limitations and restrictions could require us to modify current or future products or services, which may harm our future financial results. Any actual or perceived noncompliance with these laws, rules and regulations, our internal policies and procedures or our contracts governing the processing of personal information could result in significant consequences for BD, including, among other things, business interruption, sanctions and significant pecuniary fines, regulatory inquiries and investigations, adverse publicity, loss of competitive advantage and customer trust, as well as privacy litigation and civil lawsuits with damages. 
 The importance of privacy laws, rules and regulations for the healthcare and med-tech industry specifically is constantly growing, as personal data has become an integral part of doing business in our sector, and the legal standards are evolving and becoming more complex worldwide. For instance, the European General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR ), applicable as of 2018 and still one of the strictest and most comprehensive privacy laws in the world, is being continuously enforced, and increasingly heavy fines for GDPR violations are now being levied on businesses. Fines for noncompliance with the GDPR can amount to up to 20 million or 4 of the total worldwide annual turnover from the preceding financial year (whichever is higher) and may be imposed in conjunction with the exercise of the authority s investigatory and corrective powers. The GDPR s extraterritorial scope makes it applicable to our U.S.-based legal entities whenever our business activities, systems and products process the personal data of EU residents. Additionally, privacy laws, rules and regulations are also rapidly developing in other countries and at the state level in the U.S. in parallel with federal privacy laws protecting sensitive health information. These varying laws, rules, regulations and industry standards impact BD businesses to the extent they rely on the use of personal data and create significant compliance challenges while maintaining our global reach. In addition, certain privacy and data protection laws may apply to us indirectly through our customers, manufacturers, suppliers or other third-party 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 partners. For example, non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations by a third-party partner that is processing personal data on our behalf may be deemed non-compliance by us or a failure by us to conduct proper due diligence on the third party, which could result in material fines or litigation. We also could be subject to additional expenses and liabilities in the event of an information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of an information technology system owned or operated by us or a third party with which we partner or its vendor. 
 Defects or quality issues associated with our products could adversely affect the results of our operations. 
 The design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects, component failures, unapproved or improper use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of risks or other information relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other serious adverse events. Such events have in the past and could in the future lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products (either voluntary or as required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries), and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of a product from the market. A recall could result in significant costs and lost sales and customers, enforcement actions and/or investigations by state and federal governments or other enforcement bodies, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce future demand for our products. Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products or the imposition of post-market approval requirements. 
 Our operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property assets. 
 Many of our businesses rely on patent, trademark and other intellectual property assets. These intellectual property assets, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business. We can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations, legal challenges or governmental action. Any patent applications we own or license may not result in patents being issued and any issued patents we obtain may not provide us with any competitive advantage. Furthermore, we may fail to accurately predict all of the countries where patent protection will ultimately be desirable, and if we fail to timely file a patent application in any such country, we may be precluded from doing so at a later date. Patents attained by competitors, particularly as patents on our products expire, may also adversely affect our competitive position. Competitors may design around our intellectual property to develop competing technologies and products without infringing our intellectual property rights. In addition, competitors may seek to invalidate patents on our products or claim that our products infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise violate their intellectual property, which could result in a loss of competitive advantage or the payment of significant legal fees, damage awards and past or future royalties, as well as injunctions against future sales of our products. We also operate in countries that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the U.S., which could make it easier for competitors to compete with us in those countries. 
 We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with certain employees, consultants and other parties. These agreements may not adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors. 
 The loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings, financial condition or cash flows. 
 Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness 
 We may not be able to service all of our indebtedness. 
 We depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments. However, our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations of the combined Company and to utilize other methods to make scheduled payments will depend on a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside of our control. There can be no assurance that these sources will be adequate. If we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations, we will be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, seek additional capital, sell assets or refinance our indebtedness. Any such action may not 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 be successful and we may be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, we may not be able to refinance existing debt on favorable or comparable terms. 
 The agreements that govern our indebtedness impose restrictions that may affect our ability to operate our businesses. 
 The agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may, subject to certain significant exceptions, restrict the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur debt and the ability of us and certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things, have liens on our property, and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person, engage in certain transactions with affiliates and change the nature of our business. In addition, the agreements also require us to comply with certain financial covenants, including financial ratios. Our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations and could result in a default and acceleration under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. 
 Risks Relating to the Spin-off of Embecta Corp. 
 Risks relating to spin-off of Embecta Corp. 
 On April 1, 2022, we completed the spin-off of Embecta Corp. (Embecta) (NASDAQ: EMBC), which holds our former Diabetes Care business and is now one of the world s largest pure-play diabetes management companies in the world. The spin-off is intended to be a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If any facts, assumptions, representations, and undertakings from BD and Embecta regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, the spin-off may not qualify for tax-free treatment, which could result in significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities for BD and its shareholders. Additionally, there can be no assurances that BD will be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that are expected to result from the spin-off. 
 General Business Risks 
 We cannot guarantee that any of our strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances will be successful. 
 We seek to supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. Such transactions are inherently risky, and the integration of any newly-acquired business requires significant effort and management attention. The success of any acquisition, investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business. There can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful. 
 Natural disasters, war and other events beyond our control could disrupt our business and adversely affect our future revenues and operating income. 
 Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, wildfires and floods and other extreme weather events (including those caused by climate change), war, global health crises, terrorism, social or political unrest, labor disruptions and international conflicts and other events beyond our control, and actions taken by the U.S. and other governments or by our customers or suppliers in response to such events, could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the U.S. and areas outside of the U.S. in which we operate. These events could result in decreased demand for our products, adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities, or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers.

 Company Overview 
 Description of the Company and Business Segments 
 Becton, Dickinson and Company BD is a global medical technology company engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment and diagnostic products used by healthcare institutions, physicians, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, the pharmaceutical industry and the general public. The Company's organizational structure is based upon three principal business segments, BD Medical Medical ), BD Life Sciences Life Sciences and BD Interventional Interventional ). 
 BD s products are manufactured and sold worldwide. Our products are marketed in the United States and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to end-users by BD and independent sales representatives. We organize our operations outside the United States as follows: EMEA (which includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa); Greater Asia (which includes countries in Greater China, Japan, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Korea, Australia and New Zealand); Latin America (which includes Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and South America); and Canada.

 Strategic Objectives 
 BD remains focused on delivering durable growth, creating shareholder value and making appropriate investments for the future. BD 2025, our vehicle for value creation, is anchored in three key pillars: grow, simplify and empower. BD's management team aligns our operating model and investments with these key strategic pillars through continuous focus on the following underlying objectives: 
 Grow 
 Developing and maintaining a strong portfolio of leading products and solutions that address significant unmet clinical needs, improve outcomes, and reduce costs; 
 Focusing on our core products, services and solutions that deliver greater benefits to patients, healthcare workers and researchers; 
 Investing in research and development that leads to and expands category leadership, as well as results in a robust product pipeline; 
 Accelerating innovation in smart devices, robotics, analytics, and artificial intelligence in order to enable new care settings, streamline care workflows and remove administrative burdens for healthcare providers; 
 Leveraging our global scale in order to provide equitable access to affordable medical technologies around the world, including in under-resourced markets; 
 Supplementing our internal growth through strategic acquisitions in faster growing market segments; and 
 Focusing on cash management and an efficient capital structure in order to drive balance sheet productivity and strong shareholder returns.

 Simplify 
 Driving operating effectiveness and margin expansion by increasing factory productivity and asset efficiencies; 
 Reducing complexity, increasing agility and improving customer experience by rationalizing our product portfolio, as well as by simplifying and optimizing our architecture and operating model; 
 Making strategic investments which prioritize a culture of quality and our quality management system to ensure we are a best-in-class, proactive quality-driven organization; 
 Enhancing customer experiences through the digitalization of internal processes and go-to-market approaches; 
 Working across our supply chain to responsibly source materials and goods, as well as to reduce environmental impacts; and 
 Creating more resilient operations through investments in an enterprise-wide renewable energy strategy. 
 Empower 
 Fostering a purpose-driven culture with a focus on positive impact to all stakeholders customers, patients, employees, shareholders and communities; 
 Cultivating an inclusive work environment that welcomes and celebrates diverse backgrounds and perspectives; 
 Growing and enabling talent through training, development and reskilling strategies; and 
 Driving sustainability initiatives within our organizational units to support enterprise-wide collaboration towards our sustainability strategy. 
 In assessing the outcomes of these strategies as well as BD s financial condition and operating performance, management generally reviews forecast data, monthly actual results, including segment sales, and other similar information. We also consider trends related to certain key financial data, including gross profit margin, selling and administrative expense, investment in research and development, return on invested capital, and cash flows. 
 BD s Spin-Off of Diabetes Care and Sale of Surgical Instrumentation Platform 
 On April 1, 2022, we completed the spin-off of our former Diabetes Care business as a separate publicly traded company. The historical results of the Diabetes Care business that was contributed in the spin-off were reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements. 
 In August 2023, we completed the sale of the Interventional segment's Surgical Instrumentation platform. The historical financial results for this platform have not been classified as a discontinued operation. Additional disclosures regarding the spin-off and sale are provided in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 Key Trends Affecting Results of Operations 
 Our operations, supply chain, suppliers and customers are exposed to various global macroeconomic factors. The factors which were most impactful to our fiscal year 2023 results included the following: 
 Inflation continued to drive higher costs of raw materials, electronic components, labor, energy, and logistical services. We expect inflation to persist into our fiscal year 2024, but at levels lower than our fiscal year 2023. 
 A limited supply of skilled labor in certain markets drove higher overall labor costs, as noted above, and we expect labor availability will continue to be a macroeconomic challenge for our operations. 
 The availability of energy sources in certain markets, as well as the availability of certain raw materials and electronic components on a global basis.

 Logistics capacity constraints eased in our fiscal year 2023 compared to 2022 and lead times improved in most key routes. However, adequate supply of transportation capacity is critical to our operations and constrained capacity may unfavorably impact our results of operations. 
 Current healthcare delivery has transitioned more care from acute to non-acute settings and has increased focus on chronic disease management; this transition has placed additional financial pressure on hospitals and the broader healthcare system. Healthcare institutions may take actions to mitigate any persistent pressures on their budgets and such actions could impact the future demand for our products and services. Additionally, a worsening of staffing shortages within healthcare systems may affect the prioritization of healthcare services, which could also impact the demand for certain of our products. 
 Certain geopolitical conditions, including the evolving situations in Ukraine, the Middle East and Asia, may contribute to the macroeconomic conditions discussed above. While these geopolitical conditions have not materially impacted our results of operations to date, the continuation and/or an escalation of these evolving situations may further weaken the global economy and could result in additional inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints, including the unavailability and cost of energy. 
 Additionally, governments in China and other countries use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures, including increased use of competitive bidding and tenders as well as price regulation. During our fiscal year 2023, regional and national volume-based procurement programs VoBP established by the government in China unfavorably impacted our revenues and we anticipate that these programs may continue to impact our results of operations. 
 We continue to invest in research and development, strategic tuck-in acquisitions, geographic expansion, and new product programs to drive further revenue and profit growth. Our ability to sustain our long-term growth will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to expand our core business (including geographical expansion), develop innovative new products, and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness. 
 We have been mitigating the impacts of the macroeconomic and other factors discussed above through various strategies which leverage our procurement, logistics and manufacturing capabilities. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively mitigate these pressures in future periods and an inability to offset these pressures through our strategies, at least in part, could adversely impact our results of operations. Due to the significant uncertainty that exists relative to the duration and overall impact of the macroeconomic and other factors discussed above, our future operating performance, particularly in the short-term, may be subject to volatility. The impacts of macroeconomic and other conditions on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows are dependent on certain factors, including those discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Summary of Financial Results 
 Worldwide revenues in 2023 of 19.372 billion increased 2.7 from the prior-year period. This increase reflected the following impacts: 
 Increase (decrease) in current-period revenues Volume/other 3.0 Period-over-period decline in revenues related to COVID-19-only testing (2.3) Pricing 3.8 Foreign currency translation (1.8) Increase in revenues from the prior-year period 
 2.7 
 Our fiscal year 2023 revenues reflected sales in our Life Sciences segment related to COVID-19-only diagnostic testing on the BD Veritor TM Plus and BD Max TM Systems of 73 million, compared with revenues from such testing products in 2022 of 511 million.

 Our financial position remains strong, with cash flows from continuing operating activities totaling 2.990 billion in 2023. At September 30, 2023, we had 1.489 billion in cash and equivalents and short-term investments, including restricted cash. We continued to return value to our shareholders in the form of dividends. During fiscal year 2023, we paid cash dividends of 1.114 billion, including 1.046 billion paid to common shareholders and 68 million paid to preferred shareholders. 
 Each reporting period, we face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate from the beginning of such period. A stronger U.S. dollar, compared to the prior-year period, resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact to our revenues and earnings during our fiscal year 2023. We evaluate our results of operations on both a reported and a foreign currency-neutral basis, which excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of results on a foreign currency-neutral basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. Foreign currency-neutral ("FXN") information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We use results on a foreign currency-neutral basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. We calculate foreign currency-neutral percentages by converting our current-period local currency financial results using the prior-period foreign currency exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current-period results. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Results on a foreign currency-neutral basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Spending in 2023, 2022 and 2021 reflected our continued commitment to invest in new products and platforms. 
 Acquisitions and other restructurings 
 Restructuring expense in 2023, 2022 and 2021 primarily included restructuring costs related to simplification and other cost saving initiatives. Integration expense in 2023 and 2022 included system integration costs and integration expense in 2021 included costs incurred due to our acquisition of C.R. Bard, Inc. in fiscal year 2018. For further disclosures regarding the costs relating to restructurings, refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 Other operating (income) expense, net 
 Other operating (income) expense in 2023, 2022 and 2021 included the following items which are further discussed in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data: 
 (Millions of dollars) 2023 2022 2021 Charges to record product liability reserves, including related defense costs (See Note 6) 26 21 361 Gains on sale-leaseback transactions (See Note 18) (158) Separation-related items 14 20 Gain recognized on sale of business (see Note 2) (268) Other 18 (4) Other operating (income) expense, net (210) 37 203

 Higher interest expense in 2023 compared with 2022 was largely attributable to the higher levels of commercial paper borrowings outstanding throughout 2023 and higher overall interest rates on debt outstanding. Lower interest expense in 2022 compared with 2021 reflected lower overall interest rates on debt outstanding during 2022 and the impact of debt repayments.

 arrangements and debt instruments are provided in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 Higher interest income in 2023 compared with 2022 was largely attributable to higher interest rates and levels of cash in 2023. 
 Income Taxes 
 The income tax rates for continuing operations in 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows: 
 2023 2022 2021 Effective income tax rate for continuing operations 7.9 8.3 5.2 Impact, in basis points, from specified items (500) (500) (620) 
 
 The effective income tax rate for continuing operations in 2023 compared with 2022 primarily reflected the impact of a remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities upon the approval of a tax incentive. The effective income tax rate for continuing operations in 2022 primarily reflected a tax impact from specified items that was less favorable compared with the benefits associated with specified items recognized in 2021. 
 
 Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations 
 Net income and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows: 
 2023 2022 2021 Net income from continuing operations (Millions of dollars) 1,530 1,635 1,604 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 5.10 5.38 5.18 Unfavorable impact-specified items 7.11 5.97 6.10 (Unfavorable) favorable impact-foreign currency translation (0.37) 0.14 (0.02) 
 
 Financial Instrument Market Risk 
 We selectively use financial instruments to manage market risk, primarily foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk relating to our ongoing business operations. The counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 BD and its subsidiaries transact business in various foreign currencies throughout Europe, Greater Asia, Canada and Latin America. We face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency. These payables and receivables primarily arise from intercompany transactions. We hedge substantially all such exposures, primarily through the use of forward contracts. We have also hedged the currency exposure associated with investments in certain foreign subsidiaries with instruments such as foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency swaps, which are designated as net investment hedges, as well as currency exchange contracts. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations, including sales, to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period. We did not enter into contracts to hedge cash flows against these foreign currency fluctuations in fiscal year 2023 or 2022.

Table of Contents 

 Derivative financial instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. For foreign currency derivatives, market risk is determined by calculating the impact on fair value of an assumed change in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. Fair values were estimated based upon observable inputs, specifically spot currency rates and foreign currency prices for similar assets and liabilities. 
 With respect to the foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding at September 30, 2023 and 2022, the impact that changes in the U.S. dollar would have on pre-tax earnings was estimated as follows: 
 Increase (decrease) (Millions of dollars) 2023 2022 10 appreciation in U.S. dollar (100) (63) 10 depreciation in U.S. dollar 100 63 
 These calculations do not reflect the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying transactions that would substantially offset the results of the derivative instruments. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 When managing interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and floating rate instruments. We may enter into interest rate swaps to help maintain this balance and manage debt and interest-bearing investments in tandem, since these items have an offsetting impact on interest rate exposure. For interest rate derivative instruments, fair values are measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows using market-based observable inputs including credit risk and interest rate yield curves. Market risk for these instruments is determined by calculating the impact to fair value of an assumed change in interest rates across all maturities. 
 The impact that changes in interest rates would have on interest rate derivatives outstanding at September 30, 2023 and 2022, as well as the effect that changes in interest rates would have on our earnings or cash flows over a one-year period, based upon our overall interest rate exposure, were estimated as follows: 
 Increase (decrease) to fair value of interest rate derivatives outstanding Increase (decrease) to earnings or cash flows (Millions of dollars) 2023 2022 2023 2022 10 increase in interest rates (3) (4) 2 (1) 10 decrease in interest rates 2 4 (2) 1 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our strong financial position and cash flow performance have provided us with the capacity to accelerate our innovation pipeline through investments in research and development, as well as through strategic acquisitions. We believe that our available cash and cash equivalents, our ability to generate operating cash flow, and if needed, our access to borrowings from our financing facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our foreseeable operating needs. The following table summarizes our consolidated statement of cash flows in 2023, 2022 and 2021: 
 (Millions of dollars) 2023 2022 2021 Net cash provided by (used for) continuing operations Operating activities 2,990 2,471 4,126 Investing activities (716) (3,220) (1,843) Financing activities (1,956) (736) (3,306)

 Net Cash Flows from Continuing Operating Activities 
 Cash flows from continuing operating activities in 2023 reflected net income, adjusted by a change in operating assets and liabilities that was a net use of cash, which was significantly lower than the net use of cash in 2022 due to efforts in 2023 to optimize inventory levels. The net use of cash in 2023 primarily reflected lower levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses, as well as higher levels of trade receivables, partially offset by lower levels of prepaid expenses. 
 Cash flows from continuing operating activities in 2022 reflected net income, adjusted by a change in operating assets and liabilities that was a net use of cash. This net use of cash primarily reflected higher levels of inventory and prepaid expenses, as well as lower levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses. Cash flows from continuing operating activities in 2022 additionally reflected a discretionary cash contribution of 134 million to fund our pension obligation. 
 Cash flows from continuing operating activities in 2021 reflected higher net income, which was driven by strong revenue performance, adjusted by a change in operating assets and liabilities that was a net source of cash. This net source of cash primarily reflected higher levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by higher levels of prepaid expenses, inventory and trade receivables. Cash flows from continuing operating activities in 2021 additionally reflected a 16 million discretionary cash contribution to fund our pension obligation. 
 Net Cash Flows from Continuing Investing Activities 
 Capital expenditures 
 Our investments in capital expenditures are focused on projects that enhance our cost structure and manufacturing capabilities, as well as support our BD 2025 strategy for growth and simplification. Capital expenditures of 874 million, 973 million and 1.194 billion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, primarily related to manufacturing capacity expansions. Details of spending by segment are contained in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 Acquisitions 
 Cash outflows for acquisitions in 2022 included a cash payment of 1.548 billion associated with our acquisition of Parata Systems in the fourth quarter of 2022, as well as cash payments relating to various strategic acquisitions we have executed as part of our growth strategy, including our acquisitions of MedKeeper, Scanwell Health, Inc, Tissuemed, Ltd., and Venclose, Inc. Cash outflows for acquisitions in 2021 included a cash payment relating to the strategic acquisition of Tepha, Inc. 
 Divestitures 
 Cash inflows relating to our divestiture of the Interventional segment's Surgical Instrumentation platform in 2023 were 540 million. For further discussion, refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

 (a) Represents shareholders equity, net non-current deferred income tax liabilities, and debt. 
 
 Additional disclosures regarding our debt instruments are provided in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 Cash and Short-term Investments 
 At September 30, 2023, total worldwide cash and equivalents and short-term investments, including restricted cash, were 1.489 billion. These assets were largely held in the United States. We regularly review the amount of cash and short-term investments held outside of the United States and our historical foreign earnings are used to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property, plant and equipment expenditure needs. To fund cash needs in the United States, we rely on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and remittances from foreign subsidiaries of earnings that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. 
 Financing Facilities 
 We have a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility in place which will expire in September 2026. The credit facility, which was amended and restated in January 2023, provides borrowings of up to 2.750 billion, with separate sub-limits of 100 million and 194 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively. The expiration date of the credit facility may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods, subject to certain restrictions (including the consent of the lenders). The credit facility provides that we may, subject to additional commitments by lenders, request an additional 500 million of financing, for a maximum aggregate commitment under the credit facility of up to 3.250 billion. Proceeds from this facility 
 41

 may be used for general corporate purposes and Becton Dickinson Euro Finance S. r.l., an indirect, wholly owned finance subsidiary of BD, is authorized as an additional borrower under the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at September 30, 2023. 
 The agreement for our revolving credit facility contains the following financial covenants. We were in compliance with these covenants, as applicable, as of September 30, 2023. 
 We are required to have a leverage coverage ratio of no more than: 
 4.25-to-1 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter following the closing of the credit facility; or 
 4.75-to-1 for the four full fiscal quarters following the consummation of a material acquisition. 
 We may access commercial paper programs over the normal course of our business activities. In March 2023, we amended the agreement for our U.S. commercial paper program. The amendment provided, among other things, an increase of the maximum amount of unsecured borrowings available under the program to 2.750 billion. Also in March 2023, we entered into an agreement to establish a multicurrency euro commercial paper program. This multicurrency program allows for a maximum amount of unsecured borrowings that, when aggregated with the amount outstanding under the U.S. commercial paper program, will not exceed 2.750 billion at any time. Proceeds from these programs may be used for working capital purposes and general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions, share repurchases and repayments of debt. We had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2023. We have additional informal lines of credit outside the United States. Also, over the normal course of our business activities, we transfer certain trade receivable assets to third parties under factoring agreements. Additional disclosures regarding sales of trade receivable assets are provided in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 
 Access to Capital and Credit Ratings 
 Our corporate credit ratings with the rating agencies Standard Poor's Ratings Services S P ), Moody's Investor Service Moody's and Fitch Ratings Fitch were as follows at September 30, 2023: 
 S P Moody s Fitch Ratings: Senior Unsecured Debt BBB Baa2 BBB Commercial Paper A-2 P-2 F2 Outlook Stable Stable Stable 
 
 Our corporate credit ratings at September 30, 2023 were unchanged compared with our ratings at September 30, 2022. S P, Moody s and Fitch assigned ratings of A-2, P-2 and F2, respectively, to the multicurrency euro commercial paper program we entered into in March 2023. These ratings were consistent with the ratings already assigned to our U.S. commercial paper program. 
 Lower corporate debt ratings and downgrades of our corporate credit ratings or other credit ratings may increase our cost of borrowing. We believe that given our debt ratings, our financial management policies, our ability to generate cash flow and the non-cyclical, geographically diversified nature of our businesses, we would have access to additional short-term and long-term capital should the need arise. A rating reflects only the view of a rating agency and is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Ratings can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future. Information regarding our obligations under purchase, debt and lease arrangements are provided in Notes 6, 16 and 18, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The following discussion supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. For any given estimate or assumption made by management, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. Actual results that differ from management s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our consolidated financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements: 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Our revenues are primarily recognized when the customer obtains control of the product sold, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms specified in the sales agreement. Revenues associated with certain instruments and equipment for which installation is complex, and therefore significantly affects the customer s ability to use and benefit from the product, are recognized when customer acceptance of these installed products has been confirmed. For certain service arrangements, including extended warranty and software maintenance contracts, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. The majority of revenues relating to extended warranty contracts associated with certain instruments and equipment is generally recognized within a few years whereas deferred revenue relating to software maintenance contracts is generally recognized over a longer period. 
 Our agreements with customers within certain organizational units including Medication Management Solutions, Integrated Diagnostic Solutions and Biosciences, contain multiple performance obligations including both products and certain services noted above. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require judgment. The transaction price for these agreements is allocated to each performance obligation based upon its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling price is the amount at which we would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. We generally estimate standalone selling prices using list prices and a consideration of typical discounts offered to customers. The use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of revenue deferral. 
 Our gross revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, including rebates. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and judgment is required when determining the impact on gross revenues for a reporting period. Additional factors considered in the estimate of our rebate liability include the quantification of inventory that is either in stock at or in transit to our distributors, as well as the estimated lag time between the sale of product and the payment of corresponding rebates. 
 Impairment of Assets 
 Goodwill assets are subject to impairment reviews at least annually, or whenever indicators of impairment arise. Intangible assets with finite lives, including developed technology, and other long-lived assets, are periodically reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present. 
 We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Our reporting units represent one level below reporting segments. Our review of goodwill for each reporting unit compares the fair value of the reporting unit, estimated using an income approach, with its carrying value. Our annual goodwill impairment 
 43 

Table of Contents 

 test performed on July 1, 2023 did not result in any impairment charges, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. 
 We generally use the income approach to derive the fair value for impairment assessments. This approach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures the value of our income producing assets. This approach requires significant management judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, appropriate discount rates, terminal values and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with BD s business plans. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset. Actual results may differ from management s estimates. 
 Income Taxes 
 BD maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. 
 BD conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, we record accruals for uncertain tax positions based on the technical support for the positions, our past audit experience with similar situations, and the potential interest and penalties related to the matters. BD s effective tax rate in any given period could be impacted if, upon resolution with taxing authorities, we prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established, or we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves. 
 We have reviewed our needs in the United States for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and we continue to invest foreign subsidiaries earnings outside of the United States to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property, plant and equipment expenditure needs. As a result, we are permanently reinvested with respect to all of our historical foreign earnings as of September 30, 2023. Additional disclosures regarding our accounting for income taxes are provided in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 Contingencies 
 We are involved, both as a plaintiff and a defendant, in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, product liability and environmental matters, as further discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. We establish accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable (and in the case of environmental matters, without considering possible third-party recoveries). A determination of the amount of accruals for these contingencies is made after analysis of each individual matter. When appropriate, the accrual is developed with the consultation of outside counsel and, in the case of certain mass tort litigation, actuarial specialists regarding the nature, timing and extent of each matter. The accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in our litigation strategy. We record expected recoveries from product liability insurance carriers or other parties when realization of recovery is deemed probable. 
 Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party. In view of these uncertainties, we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, liability insurance. In the opinion of management, any such future charges, individually or in the 
 44 

Table of Contents 

 aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on BD s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and/or consolidated cash flows. 
 Benefit Plans 
 We have significant net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations that are measured using actuarial valuations which include assumptions for the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discussion. 
 The discount rate is selected each year based on investment grade bonds and other factors as of the measurement date (September 30). Specifically for the U.S. plans, we will use a discount rate of 6.01 for 2024, which was based on an actuarially-determined, company-specific yield curve to measure liabilities as of the measurement date. To calculate the pension expense in 2024, we will apply the individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments in order to calculate interest cost and service cost. Additional disclosures regarding the method to be used in calculating the interest cost and service cost components of pension expense for 2024 are provided in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, although reviewed each year, changes less frequently due to the long-term nature of the assumption. This assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of the measurement date; rather, it is used only in the calculation of pension expense. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider many factors, including our historical assumptions compared with actual results; benchmark data; expected returns on various plan asset classes, as well as current and expected asset allocations. We will use a long-term expected rate of return on plan assets assumption of 7.5 for the U.S. pension plan in 2024. We believe our discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors. 
 Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our U.S. pension and other postretirement and postemployment plans are as follows: 
 Discount rate A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated 5 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the total U.S. net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan costs. This estimate assumes no change in the shape or steepness of the company-specific yield curve used to plot the individual spot rates that will be applied to the future cash outflows for future benefit payments in order to calculate interest and service cost. 
 Expected return on plan assets A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated 3 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on U.S. pension plan costs. 
 Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. BD and its representatives may also, from time to time, make certain forward-looking statements in publicly released materials, both written and oral, including statements contained in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases, and our reports to shareholders. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as plan, expect, believe, intend, will, may, anticipate, estimate and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future operations and financial performance (including volume growth, pricing, sales and earnings per share growth, and cash flows) and statements regarding our strategy for growth, liquidity, future product development, regulatory approvals, competitive position and expenditures. All statements that address our future operating performance or events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future are forward-looking statements. 
 Forward-looking statements are, and will be, based on management s then-current views and 
 45 

Table of Contents 

 assumptions regarding future events, developments and operating performance, and speak only as of their dates. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from our expectations and projections. Investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Furthermore, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events and developments or otherwise, except as required by applicable law or regulations. 
 The following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statements. For further discussion of certain of these factors, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report and our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. 
 General global, regional or national economic downturns and macroeconomic trends, including heightened inflation, capital market volatility, interest rate and currency rate fluctuations, and economic slowdown or recession, that may result in unfavorable conditions that could negatively affect demand for our products and services, impact the prices we can charge for our products and services, disrupt our supply chain. impair our ability to produce our products, or increase borrowing costs. 
 The impact of inflation and disruptions in our global supply chain on BD and our suppliers (particularly sole-source suppliers and providers of sterilization services), including fluctuations in the cost and availability of oil-based resins and other raw materials, as well as certain components, used in the production or sterilization of our products, transportation constraints and delays, product shortages, energy shortages or increased energy costs, labor shortages or disputes, and increased operating and labor costs. 
 Conditions in international markets, including social and political conditions, geopolitical developments such as the ongoing situations in Ukraine, the Middle East and Asia, civil unrest, terrorist activity, governmental changes, restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders, economic sanctions, export controls, tariffs and other protectionist measures and barriers to market participation (such as local company and products preferences), difficulties in protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights and governmental expropriation of assets. Our international operations also increase our compliance risks, including risks under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption and bribery laws, as well as regulatory and privacy laws. 
 Competitive factors that could adversely affect our operations, including new product introductions and technologies (for example, new forms of drug delivery or novel medical therapies) by our current or future competitors, consolidation or strategic alliances among healthcare companies, distributors and/or payers of healthcare to improve their competitive position or develop new models for the delivery of healthcare, increased pricing pressure due to the impact of low-cost manufacturers, patents attained by competitors (particularly as patents on our products expire), new entrants into our markets and changes in the practice of medicine. 
 Changes in the way healthcare services are delivered, including transition of more care from acute to non-acute settings and increased focus on chronic disease management, which may affect the demand for our products and services. Additionally, budget constraints and staffing shortages, particularly shortages of nursing staff, may affect the prioritization of healthcare services, which could also impact the demand for certain of our products and services. 
 Our ability to achieve our projected level or mix of product sales, as our earnings forecasts are based on projected sales volumes and pricing of many product types, some of which are more profitable than others. 
 Changes in the coverage or reimbursement landscape, or adverse decisions relating to our products by governments or third-party payers, which could reduce demand for our products or the price we can charge for such products. 
 Cost-containment efforts in the U.S. or in other countries in which we do business, such as alternative payment reform and increased use of competitive bidding and tenders, including, without limitation, any 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 expansion of the volume-based procurement process in China or the implementation of similar cost-containment efforts. 
 Risks relating to our overall level of indebtedness, including our ability to service our debt and refinance our indebtedness, which is dependent upon the capital markets and the overall macroeconomic environment and our financial condition at such time. 
 Changes in the domestic and foreign healthcare industry or in medical practices that result in a reduction in procedures using our products or increased pricing pressures, including cost-reduction measures instituted by and the continued consolidation among healthcare providers. 
 The effects of regulatory or other events (such as public health crises) that adversely impact our supply chain, including our ability to manufacture (including sterilize) our products (particularly where production of a product line or sterilization operations are concentrated in one or more plants), source materials or components or services from suppliers (including sole-source suppliers) that are needed for such manufacturing (including sterilization), or provide products to our customers, including events that impact key distributors. In particular, there has been increased regulatory focus on the use and emission of ethylene oxide in sterilization processes, and additional regulatory requirements have been proposed and may be imposed in the future that could adversely impact BD or our third-party sterilization providers. 
 Security breaches of our information and technology systems or our products, which could impair our ability to conduct business, result in the loss of BD trade secrets or otherwise compromise sensitive information of BD or its customers, suppliers and other business partners, or of patients, including sensitive personal data, or result in product efficacy or safety concerns for certain of our products, and result in actions by regulatory bodies or civil litigation. 
 Product efficacy or safety concerns regarding our products resulting in product holds or recalls, regulatory action on the part of the FDA or foreign counterparts (including restrictions on future product clearances and civil penalties), declining sales and product liability claims, and damage to our reputation. As a result of the CareFusion acquisition, our U.S. infusion pump business is operating under a Consent Decree with the FDA. The Consent Decree authorizes the FDA, in the event of any violations in the future, to order our U.S. infusion pump business to cease manufacturing and distributing products, recall products or take other actions, and order the payment of significant monetary damages if the business subject to the decree fails to comply with any provision of the Consent Decree. In accordance with our commitments to the FDA, the overall timing of replacement or remediation of the BD Alaris Infusion Systems and return to market in the U.S. may be impacted by, among other things, customer readiness, supply continuity and our continued engagement with the FDA. 
 Difficulties inherent in product development, including the potential inability to successfully continue technological innovation, successfully complete clinical trials, obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and registrations in the U.S. and abroad, obtain intellectual property protection for our products, obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for new products, or gain and maintain market approval of products, as well as the possibility of infringement claims by competitors with respect to patents or other intellectual property rights, all of which could preclude or delay commercialization of a product. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or clearances from the FDA or other regulatory agencies or changes in the regulatory process may also delay product launches and increase development costs. 
 Any impact that public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, including COVID-19, may have on our business, the global economy and the global healthcare system. This may include decreases in the demand for our products, disruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers and customers, disruptions to our supply chain, or increases in transportation costs. 
 The impact of changes in U.S. federal or foreign laws and policies that could affect fiscal and tax policies, taxation (including tax reforms, such as the implementation of a global minimum tax, that could adversely impact multinational corporations), and international trade, including import and export

 The risks associated with the spin-off of our former Diabetes Care business, including factors that could adversely affect our ability to realize the expected benefits of the spin-off, or the qualification of the spin-off as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
 The impact of business combinations or divestitures, including any volatility in earnings relating to acquisition-related costs, and our ability to successfully integrate any business we may acquire. 
 Our ability to penetrate or expand our operations in emerging markets, which depends on local economic and political conditions, and how well we are able to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities and distribution networks. 
 Deficit reduction efforts or other actions that reduce the availability of government funding for healthcare and research, which could weaken demand for our products and result in additional pricing pressures, as well as create potential collection risks associated with such sales. 
 Fluctuations in university or U.S. and international governmental funding and policies for life sciences research. 
 Our ability to recruit and retain key employees and the impact of labor conditions which could increase employee turnover or increase our labor and operating costs and negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our business. 
 Fluctuations in the demand for products we sell to pharmaceutical companies that are used to manufacture, or are sold with, the products of such companies, as a result of funding constraints, consolidation or otherwise. 
 The impact of climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, such as regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, zero-carbon energy and sustainability mandates, and additional taxes on fuel and energy, and changing customer preferences and requirements, such as those regarding the use of materials of concern, increased demand for products with lower environmental footprints, and for companies to set and demonstrate progress against greenhouse gas reduction plans and targets. 
 Natural disasters, including the impacts of hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, fires, earthquakes and floods and other extreme weather events, global health pandemics, war, terrorism, labor disruptions and international conflicts that could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability, resulting in decreased demand for our products, adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or cause interruptions in our supply chain. 
 Pending and potential future litigation or other proceedings asserting, and/or investigations concerning and/or subpoenas and requests seeking information with respect to, alleged violations of law (including in connection with federal and/or state healthcare programs (such as Medicare or Medicaid) and/or sales and marketing practices (such as investigative subpoenas and the civil investigative demands received by BD)), potential anti-corruption and related internal control violations under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, antitrust claims, securities law claims, product liability (which may involve lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multi-district litigation proceedings, including pending claims relating to our hernia repair implant products, surgical continence products for women, vena cava filter products and implantable ports), claims with respect to environmental matters, data privacy breaches and patent infringement, and the availability or collectability of insurance relating to any such claims.

 requirements for new products and products in the post-marketing phase. In particular, the U.S. and other countries may impose new requirements regarding registration, labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to re-register products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products. Environmental laws, particularly with respect to the emission of greenhouse gases, are also becoming more stringent throughout the world, which may increase our costs of operations or necessitate changes in our manufacturing plants or processes or those of our suppliers, or result in liability to BD. 
 The effect of adverse media exposure or other publicity regarding BD s business or operations, including the effect on BD s reputation or demand for its products. 
 The effect of market fluctuations on the value of assets in BD s pension plans and on actuarial interest rate and asset return assumptions, which could require BD to make additional contributions to the plans or increase our pension plan expense. 
 Our ability to obtain the anticipated benefits of restructuring programs, if any, that we may undertake. 
 Issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the FASB or the SEC. 
 The foregoing list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could impact our ability to achieve results described in any forward-looking statements.

Reports of Management 
 Management s Responsibilities 
 The following financial statements have been prepared by management in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and include, where required, amounts based on the best estimates and judgments of management. The integrity and objectivity of data in the financial statements and elsewhere in this Annual Report are the responsibility of management. 
 In fulfilling its responsibilities for the integrity of the data presented and to safeguard the Company s assets, management employs a system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance, at appropriate cost, that the Company s assets are protected and that transactions are appropriately authorized, recorded and summarized. This system of control is supported by the selection of qualified personnel, by organizational assignments that provide appropriate delegation of authority and division of responsibilities, and by the dissemination of written policies and procedures. This control structure is further reinforced by a program of internal audits, including a policy that requires responsive action by management. 
 The Board of Directors monitors the internal control system, including internal accounting and financial reporting controls, through its Audit Committee, which consists of five independent Directors. The Audit Committee meets periodically with the independent registered public accounting firm, the internal auditors and management to review the work of each and to satisfy itself that they are properly discharging their responsibilities. The independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have full and free access to the Audit Committee and meet with its members, with and without management present, to discuss the scope and results of their audits including internal control, auditing and financial reporting matters. 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended. Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). 
 Based on the Company's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and the criteria noted above, management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 The financial statements and internal control over financial reporting have been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Ernst Young s reports with respect to fairness of the presentation of the financial statements, and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, are included herein.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of 
 Becton, Dickinson and Company 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Becton, Dickinson and Company (the Company) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of 
 September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 Basis for Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

 Estimation of Product Liability Reserves Description of the Matter As described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is a defendant in various product liability matters in which the plaintiffs allege a wide variety of claims associated with the use of certain Company devices. At September 30, 2023, the Company s product liability reserves totaled approximately 1.9 billion. The Company engaged an actuarial specialist to perform an analysis to estimate the outstanding liability for indemnity costs related to claims arising from certain of these product liability matters. The methods used by the Company to estimate these reserves are based on reported claims, historical settlement amounts, and stage of litigation, among other items. 
 
 Auditing management s estimate of certain of the Company s product liability reserves and the related disclosure was challenging due to the significant judgment required to determine the methods used to estimate the amount of unreported product liability claims and the indemnity costs and the key assumptions utilized in those methods given the stages of these matters and the amount of claims history. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over the Company s evaluation of certain product liability reserves. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the methods, significant assumptions and the underlying data used by the actuary to estimate the product liability reserves. 
 
 To evaluate management s estimate of certain product liability reserves, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by management's actuarial specialist to estimate the amount of unreported claims and the indemnity cost. For example, we compared filed and settled claims data to legal letters obtained from external counsel, and, on a sample basis, compared settlement amounts to the underlying agreements. In addition, we involved our actuarial specialists to assist us in evaluating the methods used to estimate the unreported claims and the indemnity cost used in the calculation of certain product liability reserves. We have also assessed the adequacy of the Company s disclosures in relation to these matters.

 Income taxes Uncertain tax positions Description of the Matter As discussed in Notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company conducts business in numerous countries and as a result, files tax returns in those locations. Uncertain tax positions may arise for multiple reasons including, but not limited to, the interpretation of global tax rules and regulations. The Company uses judgment to (1) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. The Company has recorded a liability of 366 million related to uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty in predicting the resolution of these tax matters, auditing the Company s uncertain tax positions involved complex analysis and auditor judgment. This also required the use of tax subject matter resources to determine whether the more likely than not criteria was met. 
 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management s accounting for uncertain tax positions, including assessment of the technical merits of tax positions. 
 
 To evaluate whether the technical merits of uncertain tax positions are more likely than not sustainable, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluation of applicable tax law, tax regulations and other regulatory guidance by our tax subject matter professionals. We also involved our tax subject matter professionals in verifying our understanding of the relevant facts and analysis, by assessing the Company s correspondence with the relevant tax authorities and evaluating third-party advice obtained by the Company. We also evaluated the adequacy of the Company s income tax disclosures included in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in relation to these matters.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Spin-Off of Embecta Corp. 
 On April 1, 2022, the Company completed the spin-off of its former Diabetes Care business as a separate publicly traded company named Embecta through a distribution of Embecta s publicly traded common stock (listed on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol "EMBC") to BD s shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 22, 2022 (the record date ). The Company distributed one share of Embecta common stock for every five common shares of BD outstanding as of the record date and shareholders received cash in lieu of fractional shares of Embecta common stock. BD retained no ownership interest in Embecta subsequent to the spin-off. The distribution is expected to qualify and has been treated as tax-free to the Company and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. On March 31, 2022, Embecta used a portion of the proceeds from its financing transactions to make a cash distribution of approximately billion to the Company. Additional disclosures regarding the various financing transactions entered into by Embecta and related to the spin-off are provided in Note 16. 
 The Company and Embecta entered into various agreements to effect the spin-off and provide a framework for the relationship between the Company and Embecta after the spin-off. Such agreements include the separation and distribution agreement, as well as the following ongoing agreements: a cannula supply agreement, an intellectual property matters agreement, a transition services agreement, manufacturing and

Product Liability Matters 
 As of September 30, 2023, the Company is defending approximately product liability claims involving the Company s line of hernia repair devices (collectively, the Hernia Product Claims ). The Company s outstanding Hernia Product Claims as of September 30, 2022 were approximately . The Company s outstanding product liability claims represent nonhomogeneous populations of claims which vary widely based upon various factors, most notably the quality of the claims. As such, claim activity during any given period may not necessarily be indicative of the Company s ultimate liability under a mass tort matter. As further discussed below, the Company s underlying estimate of its product liability includes and already accounts for unfiled claims and as such, the net year-to-date change in the number of outstanding Hernia Product Claims did not materially impact the Company s product liability accrual as of September 30, 2023. The majority of the outstanding claims are currently pending in a coordinated proceeding in Rhode Island State Court RI and in a federal multi-district litigation MDL established in the Southern District of Ohio, but claims are also pending in other state and/or federal court jurisdictions. In addition, outstanding claims include multiple putative class actions in Canada. Generally, the Hernia Product Claims seek damages for personal injury allegedly resulting from use of the products. From time to time, the Company engages in resolution discussions with plaintiffs law firms regarding certain of the Hernia Product Claims, but the Company also intends to vigorously defend Hernia Product Claims that do not settle, including through litigation and trial. A trial for the Hernia Product Claims is currently scheduled in the MDL in April 2024. 
 The Company also continues to be a defendant in certain other mass tort litigation. As of September 30, 2023, the Company is defending product liability claims involving the Company s line of pelvic mesh products, the majority of which are pending in a coordinated proceeding in New Jersey Superior Court and in various federal court jurisdictions, and the Company s line of inferior vena cava IVC filter products, which are pending in various jurisdictions. Also, as of September 30, 2023, the Company is defending product liability claims involving its implantable ports, the majority of which are pending in an MDL formed on August 8, 2023 in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and is vigorously defending itself in these matters. 
 In most product liability litigations like those described above, plaintiffs allege a wide variety of claims, ranging from allegations of serious injury caused by the products to efforts to obtain compensation notwithstanding the absence of any injury. In many of these cases, the Company has not yet received and reviewed complete information regarding the plaintiffs and their medical conditions and, consequently, is unable to fully evaluate the claims. The Company expects that it will receive and review additional information regarding any remaining unsettled product liability matters.

per claimant. The cases allege a variety of injuries, including but not limited to multiple types of cancer, allegedly attributable to exposure to EtO. The Company does not believe these cases are appropriate for class action treatment and they have not been filed as such. The Company currently has approximately of such suits involving approximately plaintiffs asserting personal injury claims; approximately of the cases also allege injury caused by exposure to a chemical of another defendant entirely unrelated to the Company. Three trial dates have been set in 2024. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and is vigorously defending itself in these matters. 
 The Company is also involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and is vigorously defending itself in each of these matters. 
 Except for the matters for which a potential disposition has been noted per above, the Company cannot predict the outcome of the other legal matters discussed above, nor can it predict whether any outcome will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated results of operations and/or consolidated cash flows. Accordingly, the Company has made no provisions for these legal matters in its consolidated results of operations. 
 The Company is a potentially responsible party to a number of federal administrative proceedings in the United States brought under the Comprehensive Environment Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as Superfund, and similar state laws. The Company also is subject to administrative proceedings under environmental laws in jurisdictions outside the U.S. The affected sites are in varying stages of development. In some instances, the remedy has been completed, while in others, environmental studies are underway or commencing. For several sites, there are other potentially responsible parties that may be jointly or severally liable to pay all or part of cleanup costs. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon the Company s experience, current information and applicable law, the Company does not expect these proceedings to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations and/or consolidated cash flows. 
 Litigation Accruals 
 The Company regularly monitors and evaluates the status of product liability and other litigated matters, and may, from time-to-time, engage in settlement discussions and mediation taking into consideration, among other things, developments in the litigation and the risks and uncertainties associated therewith. These activities have resulted in confidential settlements and going forward could result in further settlements, the terms of which would be confidential. A determination of the accrual amounts for these contingencies is made after analysis of each litigation matter. When appropriate, the accrual is developed with the consultation of outside 
 72 

Table of Contents 
 
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
 Becton, Dickinson and Company 

million, million, and million, respectively, related to certain of the product liability matters discussed above under the heading Product Liability Matters, including the related legal defense costs. 
 The Company considers relevant information when estimating its product liability accruals, including, but not limited to: the nature, number, and quality of unfiled and filed claims; the rate of claims being filed; the status of settlement discussions with plaintiffs counsel; the allegations and documentation supporting or refuting such allegations; publicly available information regarding similar medical device mass tort settlements; historical information regarding other product liability settlements involving the Company; and the stage of litigation. Because currently available information regarding product liability matters is often limited, there is inherent uncertainty and volatility relating to the Company s estimate of product liability. As additional information becomes available, the Company records adjustments to its product liability accruals as required. 
 Accruals for the Company's product liability claims which are discussed above, as well as the related legal defense costs, amounted to approximately billion and billion at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These accruals, which are generally long-term in nature, are largely recorded within Deferred Income Taxes and Other Liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The decrease in the Company s product liability accrual as of September 30, 2023, as compared with September 30, 2022, largely reflected the payment of settlements and legal fees during the fiscal year 2023, which reduced the amount of the accrual. The increase in the number of outstanding hernia repair device claims discussed above did not materially impact the Company s product liability accrual because the underlying estimate of the Company s liability includes and already accounts for unfiled claims. Moreover, the accrual reflects the determination that the quality of new hernia repair device claims has generally diminished over time. Claim activity during the fiscal year 2023 relating to the pelvic mesh device and IVC filter matters did not materially impact the Company s product liability accrual as of September 30, 2023. 
 Additionally, the particular outcome in any one product liability trial is typically not representative of potential outcomes of all cases or claims. Because the accrual already contemplates a wide range of possible outcomes, including those with a de minimis value, individual outcomes generally do not impact the value of other cases in the total case inventory or the overall product liability accrual.

million and million, respectively. The impact of other forms of variable consideration, including sales discounts and sales returns, is not material to the Company's revenues. Additional disclosures relating to sales discounts and sales returns are provided in Note 19. 
 
 Effects of Revenue Arrangements on Consolidated Balance Sheets 
 Due to the nature of the majority of the Company's products and services, the Company typically does not incur costs to fulfill a contract in advance of providing the customer with goods or services. Capitalized contract costs associated with the costs to fulfill contracts for certain products in the Medication Management Solutions organizational unit are immaterial to the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The Company's costs to obtain contracts are comprised of sales commissions which are paid to the Company's employees or third party agents. The majority of the sales commissions incurred by the Company relate to revenue that is recognized over a period that is less than one year and as such, the Company has elected a practical expedient provided under ASC 606 to record the majority of its expense associated with sales commissions as it is incurred. Commissions

million of contract liabilities. Contract liabilities as of September 30, 2022, were immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial results. The Company's liability for product warranties provided under its agreements with customers is not material to its consolidated balance sheets. 
 Remaining Performance Obligations 
 The Company's obligations relative to service contracts, which are further discussed above, and pending installations of equipment, primarily in the Company's Medication Management Solutions unit, represent unsatisfied performance obligations of the Company. The revenues under existing contracts with original expected durations of more than one year, which are attributable to products and/or services that have not yet been installed or provided, are estimated to be approximately billion at September 30, 2023. The Company expects to recognize the majority of this revenue over the next . 
 Within the Company's Medication Management Solutions, Medication Delivery Solutions, Integrated Diagnostic Solutions, and Biosciences units, some contracts also contain minimum purchase commitments of reagents or other consumables and the future sales of these consumables represent additional unsatisfied performance obligations of the Company. The revenue attributable to the unsatisfied minimum purchase commitment-related performance obligations, for contracts with original expected durations of more than one year, is estimated to be approximately billion at September 30, 2023. This revenue will be recognized over the customer relationship periods.

 Expected volatility is based upon historical volatility for the Company s common stock and other factors. The expected life of SARs granted is derived from the output of the lattice-based model, using assumed exercise rates based on historical exercise and termination patterns, and represents the period of time that SARs granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate used is based upon the published U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar life. The dividend yield is based upon the most recently declared quarterly dividend as of the grant date. The Company issued million shares during 2023 to satisfy the SARs exercised.

In fiscal year 2021, the Company also issued additional performance-based time-vested units to certain key executives, which cliff vest three years after the date of grant and are tied to the Company s performance against average annual growth in the Company s Adjusted EPS over a performance period of three years. No shares will be issuable if the performance targets have not been met. The fair value is based on the market price of the Company s stock on the date of grant. Compensation cost initially recognized assumes that the target payout level will be achieved and is adjusted for subsequent changes in the expected outcome of performance-related conditions. For units for which the performance conditions are modified after the date of grant, any incremental increase in the fair value of the modified units, over the original units, is recorded as compensation expense on the date of the modification for vested units, or over the remaining performance period for units not yet vested.

 Expected benefit payments associated with postretirement healthcare plans are immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial results. 
 Investments 
 The Company s primary objective is to achieve returns sufficient to meet future benefit obligations. It seeks to generate above market returns by investing in more volatile asset classes such as equities while at the same time controlling risk through diversification in non-correlated asset classes and through allocations to more stable asset classes like fixed income. 
 U.S. Plans 
 The Company s U.S. pension plans comprise of total benefit plan investments, based on September 30, 2023 market values, and have a target asset mix of fixed income, diversifying investments and equities. This mix was established based on an analysis of projected benefit payments and estimates of long-term returns, volatilities and correlations for various asset classes. The asset allocations to diversifying investments include high-yield bonds, hedge funds, real estate, infrastructure, leveraged loans and emerging markets bonds. 
 The actual portfolio investment mix may, from time to time, deviate from the established target mix due to various factors such as normal market fluctuations, the reliance on estimates in connection with the determination of allocations and normal portfolio activity such as additions and withdrawals. Rebalancing of the asset portfolio on a quarterly basis is required to address any allocations that deviate from the established target allocations in excess of defined allowable ranges. The target allocations are subject to periodic review, including a review of the asset portfolio s performance, by the named fiduciary of the plans. Any tactical deviations from the established asset mix require the approval of the named fiduciary. 
 The U.S. plans may enter into both exchange traded and non-exchange traded derivative transactions in order to manage interest rate exposure, volatility, term structure of interest rates, and sector and currency

 (a) As required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company s research and development expenditures were capitalized and amortized in fiscal year 2023 for income tax purposes. This resulted in an increase in cash tax paid in fiscal year 2023 with a corresponding deferred tax benefit. 
 (b) Net deferred tax assets are included in Other Assets and net deferred tax liabilities are included in Deferred Income Taxes and Other Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets . 
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are netted on the balance sheet by separate tax jurisdictions. The Company asserts indefinite reinvestment for all historical unremitted foreign earnings as of September 30, 2023. Deferred taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of September 30, 2023 since the determination of the total amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable. 
 Generally, deferred tax assets have been established as a result of net operating losses and credit carryforwards with expiration dates from 2024 to an unlimited expiration date. Valuation allowances have been established as a result of an evaluation of the uncertainty associated with the realization of certain deferred tax assets on these losses and credit carryforwards. The valuation allowance at September 30, 2023 is primarily the result of foreign losses due to the Company s global re-organization of its foreign entities and these generally have no expiration date. Valuation allowances are also maintained with respect to deferred tax assets for certain state carryforwards that may not be realized.

 to approximately years and the weighted-average remaining lease term of the Company s leases is approximately years. An option to renew or terminate the current term of a lease arrangement is included in the lease term if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option. 
 For the longer-term lease arrangements that are recognized on the Company s consolidated balance sheet, the right-of-use asset and lease liability is initially measured at the commencement date based upon the present value of the lease payments due under the lease. These payments represent the combination of the fixed lease and fixed non-lease components that are due under the arrangement. The costs associated with the Company s short-term leases, as well as variable costs relating to the Company s lease arrangements, are not material to its consolidated financial results. 
 The implicit interest rates of the Company s lease arrangements are generally not readily determinable and as such, the Company applies an incremental borrowing rate, which is established based upon the information available at the lease commencement date, to determine the present value of lease payments due

 An event of default for a particular series of BD notes under the BD indenture does not necessarily constitute an event of default for any other series of BD notes or for any other series of debt securities under the BD indenture. 
 Additional BD Notes 
 We may, without notice to or consent of the holders or beneficial owners of any series of the BD notes, issue additional BD notes of such series having the same ranking, interest rate, maturity and or other terms as the applicable series of BD notes. Any such additional BD notes issued should be considered under the BD indenture fungible with and part of the same series of BD notes under the BD indenture as the applicable series of BD notes. In the event any additional BD notes are not fungible with the BD notes of the applicable series for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such nonfungible additional BD notes will be issued with a separate CUSIP number so that they are distinguishable from the applicable series of BD notes. 
 Issuance in Euro 
 If the euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or the euro is no longer used by the then member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions within the international banking community, then all payments in respect of the 0.034 2025 notes and the 1.900 2026 notes (collectively, the Euro BD notes will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to us or so used. 
 3 

The amount payable on any date in euro will be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate mandated by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board as of the close of business on the second business day prior to the relevant payment date or, in the event the U.S. Federal Reserve Board has not mandated a rate of conversion, on the basis of the most recent euro U.S. dollar exchange rate available on or prior to the second business day prior to the relevant payment date, as determined by us in our sole discretion. Any payment in respect of any series of Euro BD notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default under the applicable Euro BD notes or the BD indenture. Neither the trustee nor the paying agent have any responsibility for any calculation or conversion in connection with the foregoing. 
 Issuance in GBP 
 If GBP is unavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or GBP is no longer used by the United Kingdom as currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions within the international banking community, then all payments in respect of the 3.020 2025 notes will be made in U.S. dollars until GBP is again available to us or so used. 
 The amount payable on any date in GBP will be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate mandated by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board as of the close of business on the second business day prior to the relevant payment date or, in the event the U.S. Federal Reserve Board has not mandated a rate of conversion, on the basis of the most recent GBP U.S. dollar exchange rate available on or prior to the second business day prior to the relevant payment date, as determined by us in our sole discretion. Any payment in respect of the 3.020 2025 notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default under the 3.020 2025 notes or the BD indenture. Neither the trustee nor the paying agent have any responsibility for any calculation or conversion in connection with the foregoing. 
 Interest on the BD Notes 
 We make interest payments to the person in whose name each series of BD notes are registered on the business day preceding the interest payment date of each year. The rights of holders of beneficial interests of the BD notes to receive the payments of interest on such BD notes are subject to the applicable procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear. 
 If any interest payment date is not a business day, payment of interest is made on the next day that is a business day and no interest accrues as a result of such delayed payment on amounts payable from and after such interest payment date to the next succeeding business day. For the purposes of the BD notes, business day means any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday and that is not a day on which banking institutions are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close in the City of New York or London and on which the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer system (the TARGET2 system), or any successor thereto, operates. Interest on each series of the BD notes is computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated and the actual number of days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on such series of the BD notes (or from the original issuance date of the applicable series of BD notes, if no interest has been paid on such series of BD notes), to but excluding the next scheduled interest payment date. This payment convention is referred to as ACTUAL ACTUAL (ICMA) as defined in the rulebook of the International Capital Market Association. 
 Optional Redemption 
 We may, at our option, redeem each series of the BD notes, in whole or in part, (i) at any time prior to July 13, 2025 (one month prior to the maturity date) with respect to the 0.034 2025 notes, (ii) at any time prior to February 24, 2025 (three months prior to the maturity date) with respect to the 3.020 2025 notes and (iii) at any time prior September 15, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date) with respect to the 1.900 2026 notes. The redemption price, as determined by us, will be equal to the greater of 
 100 of the principal amount of the applicable series of BD notes to be redeemed and 
 the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments on the applicable series of BD notes being redeemed, discounting such payments to the redemption date on an annual basis (ACTUAL ACTUAL (ICMA)) at the applicable comparable government bond rate, plus (i) 15 basis points in the case of the 0.034 2025 notes, (v) 25 basis points in the case of the 3.020 2025 notes and (vi) 25 basis points in the case of the 1.900 2026 notes, in 
 4

Unless we default on payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, the applicable series of BD notes or any portion of such BD notes called for redemption will stop accruing interest. On or before any redemption date, we will deposit with the paying agent or the trustee money sufficient to pay the accrued interest on the applicable series of BD notes to be redeemed and their redemption price. A partial redemption of any series of BD notes may be effected pursuant to applicable procedures of the depository or the paying agent, and may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for such BD notes or any integral multiple of (i) with respect to the Euro BD notes, 1,000 in excess thereof and (ii) with respect to the 3.020 2025 notes, 1,000 in excess thereof) of the principal amount of such BD notes of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination for such BD notes.

The following description is a summary of selected portions of the Becton Finance indenture. It does not restate the Becton Finance indenture, and the Becton Finance indenture, not this description, define the rights of a holder of the Becton Finance notes. 
 Terms of the Becton Finance Notes 
 The registered holder of a Becton Finance note is treated as its owner for all purposes. Only registered holders of Becton Finance notes have rights under the Becton Finance indenture governing the Becton Finance notes. The Becton Finance indenture, the Becton Finance notes and the guarantees thereof are governed by the laws of the State of New York.

 An event of default for a particular series of Becton Finance notes under the Becton Finance indenture does not necessarily constitute an event of default for other series of Becton Finance notes or for any other series of debt securities under the Becton Finance indenture. 
 Additional Becton Finance Notes 
 We may, without notice to or consent of the holders or beneficial owners of any series of the Becton Finance notes of such series, issue additional Becton Finance notes of the applicable series having the same ranking, interest rate, maturity and or other terms as the applicable series of Becton Finance notes. Any such additional Becton Finance notes issued should be considered under the Becton Finance indenture fungible with and part of the same series of Becton Finance notes under the Becton Finance indenture as the applicable series of Becton Finance notes. In the event any additional Becton Finance notes are not fungible with the Becton Finance notes of the applicable series for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such nonfungible additional Becton Finance notes will be issued with a separate CUSIP number so that they are distinguishable from the applicable series of Becton Finance notes. 
 Guarantees 
 BD fully and unconditionally guarantees (1) the full and punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, of all obligations of Becton Finance under the Becton Finance indenture (including obligations to the trustee) and the Becton Finance notes, whether for payment of principal of, or interest on or premium, if any, on, the Becton Finance notes and all other monetary obligations of Becton Finance under the Becton Finance indenture and the Becton Finance notes and (2) the full and punctual performance within applicable grace periods of all other obligations of Becton Finance whether for fees, expenses, indemnification or otherwise under the Becton Finance indenture and the Becton Finance notes. Any obligation of BD to make a payment may be satisfied by causing Becton Finance to make such payment. The guarantees are a senior unsecured obligation of BD and are pari passu with all of its other senior unsecured obligations. 
 Issuance in Euro 
 If the euro is unavailable to us or, in the case of the guarantees, BD, due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our or BD s control or the euro is no longer used by the then member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions within the international banking community, then all payments in respect of the Becton Finance notes or the guarantees will be made in U.S. dollars until the euro is again available to us or, in the case of the guarantees, BD, or so used. 
 The amount payable on any date in euro will be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate mandated by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board as of the close of business on the second business day prior to the relevant payment date or, in the 
 11 

event the U.S. Federal Reserve Board has not mandated a rate of conversion, on the basis of the most recent euro U.S. dollar exchange rate available on or prior to the second business day prior to the relevant payment date, as determined by us in our sole discretion. Any payment in respect of any series of Becton Finance notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute an event of default under the applicable Becton Finance notes or the Becton Finance indenture. Neither the trustee nor the paying agent have any responsibility for any calculation or conversion in connection with the foregoing. 
 Interest on the Becton Finance Notes 
 We or, in the case of the guarantees, BD, make interest payments to the person in whose name each series of Becton Finance notes are registered on the business day preceding the interest payment date of each year. The rights of holders of beneficial interests of the Becton Finance notes to receive the payments of interest on such Becton Finance notes are subject to the applicable procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear. 
 If any interest payment date is not a business day, payment of interest is made on the next day that is a business day and no interest accrues as a result of such delayed payment on amounts payable from and after such interest payment date to the next succeeding business day. For the purposes of the Becton Finance notes, business day means any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday and that is not a day on which banking institutions are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close in the City of New York or London and on which the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer system (the TARGET2 system), or any successor thereto, operates. Interest on each series of the Becton Finance notes is computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated and the actual number of days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on such series of Becton Finance notes (or from the original issuance date of the applicable series of Becton Finance notes, if no interest has been paid on such series of Becton Finance notes), to but excluding the next scheduled interest payment date. This payment convention is referred to as ACTUAL ACTUAL (ICMA) as defined in the rulebook of the International Capital Market Association. 
 Optional Redemption 
 We may, at our option, redeem each series of Becton Finance notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to (i) March 4, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date) with respect to the 1.208 2026 notes and (ii) November 12, 2035 with respect to the 1.213 2036 notes. The redemption price, as determined by us, will be equal to the greater of 
 100 of the principal amount of the applicable series of Becton Finance notes to be redeemed and 
 the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments on the applicable series of Becton Finance notes being redeemed, discounting such payments to the redemption date on an annual basis (ACTUAL ACTUAL (ICMA)) at the applicable comparable government bond rate, plus (i) 25 basis points in the case of the 1.208 2026 notes and (ii) 25 basis points in the case of the 1.213 2036 notes, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding the date of redemption on the principal balance of the applicable series of Becton Finance notes being redeemed. The trustee has no responsibility for calculating the redemption price. 
 At any time on or after (i) March 4, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date) with respect to the 1.208 2026 notes and (ii) November 12, 2035 with respect to the 1.213 2036 notes, we may redeem such series of Becton Finance notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the applicable series of Becton Finance notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption on the principal balance of the applicable series of Becton Finance notes being redeemed. 
 The term comparable government bond rate means the yield to maturity, expressed as a percentage (rounded to three decimal places, with 0.0005 being rounded upwards), on the third business day prior to the date fixed for redemption, of the comparable government bond (as defined below) on the basis of the middle market price of the comparable government bond prevailing at 11 00 a.m. (London time) on such business day as determined by an independent investment bank selected by us. 
 The term comparable government bond means, in relation to any comparable government bond rate calculation, at the discretion of an independent investment bank selected by us, a German federal government bond whose maturity is closest to the maturity of the applicable series of Becton Finance notes to be redeemed (assuming with respect to the 1.213 2036 notes, that such 1.213 2036 notes to be redeemed matured on November 12, 2035), or if such

Exhibit 10(c) 
 
 BECTON, DICKINSON AND COMPANY 
 PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN 
 AMENDED AND RESTATED EFFECTIVE AS OF JULY 25, 2023 
 PURPOSE 
 The purpose of the Performance Incentive Plan (the Plan is to provide annual incentive payments to associates for their contribution to the Company s successful financial performance and the accomplishment of strategic objectives. 
 Notwithstanding anything in this plan to the contrary, the payment of annual incentives, if any, is solely within the discretion of the PIP Steering Committee and the Board of Directors, except that payment in excess of the plan guidelines will not be made. No employee has any vested right to any such payment. 
 PIP STEERING COMMITTEE 
 The PIP Steering Committee will be responsible for administering this Plan, except that the Compensation and Human Capital Committee of the Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee will be responsible for administering this Plan with respect to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and other members of the Executive Leadership Team (the ExLT and for selection and approval of total Company metrics, targets, and payouts, as specified herein. The PIP Steering Committee will consist of no less than three persons, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief People Officer and such other senior executives as are designated from time to time by the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief People Officer shall have authority to act on behalf of the PIP Steering Committee with respect to all matters under this Plan. 
 ELIGIBILITY 
 Participation in any particular fiscal year is generally restricted to employees of the Company and its worldwide subsidiaries in Job Group 4 and above positions (other than those covered under other incentive plans or sales incentive plans) and other key positions as may be approved by the PIP Steering Committee. Current employees promoted to, and persons newly hired to, eligible positions during a particular fiscal year may be considered for a pro-rata bonus provided that such employees are promoted to, or newly hired to, eligible positions on or before July 1 of the particular fiscal year. Persons employed by companies acquired by the Company which have pre-existing incentive, profit sharing or similar programs will not participate in this Plan until and unless those plans are superseded by this Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, employees who transferred out of the Company due to a divestiture of a subsidiary or business unit during the fiscal year will not be eligible for an incentive payment under this Plan with respect to the fiscal year in which the spin-off occurs, except as otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee. 
 PARTICIPATION LEVELS 
 Plan targets for eligible employees are determined based upon the scope and responsibilities of the position. Plan targets for eligible employees who have received a promotion or other role change during the applicable year will be pro-rated based on the eligible employee s time in each role. 

DETERMINATION OF PERFORMANCE CRITERIA 
 Prior to or shortly following the beginning of a fiscal year, the Compensation Committee shall establish financial and strategic criteria, targets and related formula(s) with respect to the total Company, which shall apply to the ExLT and other applicable associates, and the PIP Steering Committee shall establish financial and strategic criteria, targets and related formula(s) tied to results below total Company, including targets related to segment, business unit, region, and or country performance. 
 INCENTIVE CALCULATION 
 Incentive payments shall be made under the Plan based upon total Company, segment, business unit, region, and or country performance, as applicable, as measured against the financial and strategic criteria and targets established as set forth above. Subject to the terms of this Plan as set forth herein, Incentive Payments for individual participants shall generally be equal to the applicable final business modifier (i.e. the percentage of achievement of the financial and strategic criteria and targets upon application of the applicable pre-approved formula) multiplied by the participant's target and salary or earnings, as applicable. For participants approved for Exceptional Impact (discussed below), this calculation is also increased by a set Exceptional Impact Reward Percentage to determine each recipient s Incentive Payment. For participants who have been designated as needing performance remediation, this calculation will be reduced by a set percentage. For the ExLT, the Compensation Committee (and in the case of the Chief Executive Officer, the independent directors of the Board) shall approve the final incentive payment amount in its sole discretion after considering the formula noted above. For the avoidance of doubt, the final incentive payment for any ExLT member, as determined by the Compensation Committee or the Board, as applicable, may greater or less than the amount determined pursuant to the formula noted above. 
 DETERMINATION OF FUNDING LEVELS 
 Funding levels relating to ExLT incentive payments shall be determined by the Compensation Committee based on total Company performance as measured against the corporate financial and strategic performance targets in accordance with the formula established by the Compensation Committee. Funding levels tied to incentive payments below total Company shall be determined by the PIP Steering Committee based on the satisfaction of the performance targets in accordance with the formula established by the PIP Steering Committee at the beginning of the Fiscal Year. These funding levels are adjusted both upwards (for performance above target) and downwards (for performance below target). With respect to total Company, the Compensation Committee has the discretion to make adjustments to the Company s operating results for unbudgeted items that are not considered part of BD s ordinary operations and other events that significantly impacted BD s performance. Similarly, the PIP Steering Committee has this same discretion for results below total Company. 
 DETERMINATION OF INCENTIVE POOLS AND FINAL INCENTIVES 
 (a) Theoretical Incentive and Exceptional Impact Pool 
 Following the close of each fiscal year, a hypothetical incentive pool will be established assuming achievement at 100 of target for participants, and the PIP Steering Committee will hold back an amount of the hypothetical incentive pool, in an amount determined by the PIP Steering Committee in its sole discretion, to be established as an Exceptional Impact Pool. For purposes of determining the hypothetical incentive pool, the target for participants who have had a salary, individual target, or status change during 

the applicable fiscal year will be pro-rated based on the period during the year that the original salary, individual target, or status and the adjusted salary, individual target, or status was applicable. 
 (b) Final Business Modifiers 
 Following the close of each fiscal year, the Compensation Committee (with respect to incentives based on total Company performance) and the PIP Steering Committee (with respect to incentives based on segment, business unit, region and or country performance) will determine the final achievement level of the financial and strategic performance targets and will apply the formula established by the Compensation Committee or PIP Steering Committee, as applicable, to determine the final business modifiers for the applicable fiscal year. 
 (c) Communication 
 The operating unit and performance results will be communicated throughout the organization to the extent that the Company deems appropriate and subject to any confidentiality concerns. 
 (d) Incentive Payment Recommendations 
 The ExLT will review and approve the list of designated participants below the ExLT who have had exceptional impact during the fiscal year for an additional amount to be paid through the Exceptional Impact Pool. The Compensation Committee will review and approve any ExLT participants who are considered to have had exceptional impact during the fiscal year and who will be eligible for an additional amount to be paid through the Exceptional Impact Pool, and will determine, for such ExLT participants, the Exceptional Impact Reward Percentage that will apply to such ExLT participants. ExLT members who have been designated as needing performance remediation will receive a reduced incentive amount, as determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion. For all participants below the ExLT, the PIP Steering Committee determines the Exceptional Impact Percentange. 
 The PIP Steering Committee will apply the final business modifiers, and Exceptional Impact Reward Percentage to the individual incentive targets as applicable to determine the final incentive amounts for participants (other than the ExLT). Participants who have been designated as needing performance remediation will receive a reduced incentive amount. The Compensation Committee will approve the final total Company business modifier and will determine the final incentive payments for the ExLT (inclusive of Exceptional Impact awards) in its sole discretion. 
 Participants who have been on an approved leave of absence during the fiscal year may have their incentive amounts pro-rated based on Company policy in the applicable region or country. No individual may receive an incentive payment in excess of 200 of the their target incentive. 
 FINAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL 
 All incentive payments for the participants other than the ExLT will be reviewed and approved by the Chief Executive Officer, in the aggregate or on a case-by-case basis, as appropriate. In the case of the ExLT, recommendations will be subject to final review and approval by the Compensation Committee(and in the case of the Chief Executive Officer, the independent directors of the Board). The Compensation Committee (and the Board, as applicable) has the discretion to reduce payouts based on any factors it deems appropriate, including whether an individual has taken unnecessary or excessive risk. 

(a) Payment 
 Incentives will generally be paid by January of the calendar year following the year in which they are awarded (unless deferred by the participant). Except in cases of death, disability, retirement, or involuntary terminations due to the elimination of employees position, no incentive payments will be made to individuals who are not active employees on the final day of the fiscal year. Employees who are terminated for cause prior to the distribution date will forfeit their incentives. 
 If an employee is terminated by reason of death, disability, or retirement, his or her incentive payment will paid in or around January of the calendar year following the year in which it was awarded and will be based on applicable business performance and pro-rated based on the number of days the employee was actively at work during the fiscal year in which the incentive payment was awarded. 
 Incentives awarded to any employee who dies prior to the distribution date may be made to the employee's estate or beneficiares at the discretion of management. 
 If a U.S.-based employee has experienced a Termination Due to Workforce Restructuring, as determined in accordance with the U.S. BD Severance Plan, or an employee who is not a U.S.-based employee is terminated by reason of an involuntary termination due to the elimination of the employee s position, as determined in the sole discretion of the applicable Human Resources business partner, such employee may receive a pro-rated incentive payment at the target level of performance based on his or her individual incentive target and salary or earnings as applicable. In the event that an employee shall receive a pro-rated incentive payment under this paragraph, the incentive payment will be pro-rated based on the number of days the employee was actively at work during the fiscal year in which the incentive payment was awarded and be paid in accordance with the following 
 (i) if the employee is a U.S.-based employee, the pro-rated incentive payment shall be paid under, in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of the U.S. BD Severance Plan and subject to the Plan Administrator of the U.S. BD Severance Plan s discretion to eliminate or modify such pro-rated incentive payment and 
 (ii) if the employee is not a U.S.-based employee, the pro-rated incentive payment shall be paid under the Plan in accordance with applicable law, subject to local rules, practices, procedures, and limitations that would provide for a lesser benefit (e.g., probationary periods) provided that the lead Human Resources business partner and the Regional Total Rewards Director may, in their sole and absolute discretion, authorize a pro-rated incentive payment that is different from the amount otherwise set forth in this Plan or determine that an individual is not entitled to a pro-rated incentive payment and, provided further that the payment of any incentive under this subsection shall also be in satisfaction of any local severance plan, arrangement, or law that requires the payment of bonus (or any similar compensation) as part of severance or separation pay. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, participants in the ExLT, including the Chief Executive Officer, are eligible to receive a prorated bonus pursuant to this Plan unless they are a participant in or a party to a separate plan, agreement, or arrangement that was approved by the Company. 
 (b) Exceptions 
 Any recommendations for exceptions to the provisions of the Plan must be submitted to the PIP Steering Committee for review and are subject to final approval by the Chief Executive Officer. Any exceptions applicable to the ExLT are further subject to approval by the Compensation Committee (and in the case of the Chief Executive Officer, the independent directors of the Board). 

RECOVERY OF INCENTIVE PAYMENTS 
 Any incentive payment approved under this Plan shall be subject to the terms of the Company s Policy Regarding the Recovery of Compensation, as the same may be subsequently amended, or any similar policy or policies established by the Company that may apply to the employee (referred to as the Policy provided, that no amendment to the Policy shall adversely affect the rights of an employee with respect to any incentive payment that is approved in accordance with this Plan prior to such amendment. The Company s rights under the Policy shall be in addition to, and not in substitution of, the Company s rights under this Plan or otherwise and, in all events, the terms of the Policy shall prevail to the extent that the terms of the Policy conflict with this Plan or any other plan, program, agreement or arrangement.

 (A) Good Reason means the occurrence (without the Participant s express written consent) of (1) a reduction in the Participant s base salary as in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control or as the same may be increased thereafter from time to time, or a reduction in the Participant s annual performance incentive award opportunity or equity-based compensation that is not in good faith and consistent with past practices, or (2) any change in the location of the Participant s principal place of employment as it existed immediately prior to the Change in Control to a location that is more than twenty-five (25) miles from such principal place of employment. No event described above shall constitute Good Reason unless the Participant gives written notice to the Company of the existence of the event within 90 days after the initial occurrence of such event and the Company has not remedied such within 30 days of receipt of such notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Participant is a party to a Change in Control Agreement (as defined below), Good Reason with respect to such Participant for purposes of this Plan shall have the meaning given to such term in the Change in Control Agreement. 
 12 

(B) Change in Control Agreement means an employment agreement or other agreement or plan between the Company and a Participant and approved by the Board or the Committee that provides for the continued employment of the Participant following a Change in Control and the payment of benefits upon termination of employment in connection with or following a Change in Control. 
 (v) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11(g) to the contrary, any Awards that are otherwise subject to Code Section 409A shall not be distributed or payable upon a Change in Control unless the Change in Control otherwise meets the requirements for a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company within the meaning of Code Section 409A and the regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder instead such Awards shall be distributed or payable in accordance with the Award s applicable terms. 
 (i) Non-employee Directors of the Company shall be entitled to defer the receipt of any Shares that may become issuable to them under any Award in accordance with the terms of the 1996 Directors Deferral Plan, as the same may be hereinafter amended, or any other plan that may be established by the Company that provides for the deferred receipt of such Shares. 
 (j) Employees of the Company shall be entitled to defer the receipt of any Shares that may become issuable to them under any Award in accordance with the terms of the Deferred Compensation and Retirement Benefit Restoration Plan, as the same may be hereinafter amended, or any other plan that may be established by the Company that provides for the deferred receipt of such Shares. 
 (k) Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary (but subject to Sections (7)(d) and (e), 8(c), 10, and 11(h) of the Plan), no Award granted under the Plan shall become vested over a period of less than one year following the date the applicable Award is granted provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Awards that result in the issuance of up to 5 of the Shares reserved for issuance under Section 5(a)(ii) may be granted to any one or more Participants without respect to such minimum vesting provisions. Nothing in this Section 11(k) shall preclude the Committee from taking action, in its sole discretion, to accelerate the vesting of any Award in connection with or following a Participant s death, Disability, retirement, termination of service other than for Cause, or the consummation of a Change in Control. 
 (l) Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, any dividend or dividend equivalent otherwise payable in respect of any Award of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Unit, Performance Unit, or Other Stock-Based Award that remains subject to vesting conditions at the time of payment or accrual of such dividend or dividend equivalent shall be retained by the Company and remain subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying Award to which the dividend relates, and the right to any such accumulated dividends shall be forfeited upon the forfeiture of the Award to which such dividends relate. 
 Section 12. Amendments and Termination . 
 (a) Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law and unless otherwise expressly provided in an Award Agreement or in the Plan, the Board may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue, or terminate the Plan or any portion thereof at any time provided , however , that no such amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuation or termination shall be made without (i) shareholder approval (A) if the effect thereof is to increase the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan or to expand the class of persons eligible to participate in the Plan or (B) if such approval is necessary to comply with any tax or regulatory requirement for which or 
 13 

with which the Board deems it necessary or desirable to qualify or comply or (ii) the consent of the affected Participant, if such action would adversely affect the rights of such Participant under any outstanding Award. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Committee may amend the Plan in such manner as may be necessary to enable the Plan to achieve its stated purposes in any jurisdiction outside the United States in a tax-efficient manner and in compliance with local rules and regulations. In all events, no termination or amendment shall be made in a manner that is inconsistent with the requirements under Code Section 409A to allow for tax deferral. 
 (b) The Committee may waive any conditions or rights under, amend any terms of, or amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate, any Award theretofore granted, prospectively or retroactively, without the consent of any relevant Participant or holder or beneficiary of an Award provided , however , that no such action shall impair the rights of any affected Participant or holder or beneficiary under any Award theretofore granted under the Plan and provided further that, except as provided in Section 5(e), no such action shall reduce the exercise price, grant price or purchase price of any Award established at the time of grant thereof and provided further , that the Committee s authority under this Section 12(b) is limited in the case of Awards subject to Section 11(f), as set forth in Section 11(f) and provided further , that the Committee may not act under this Section 12(b) in a way that is inconsistent with the requirements under Code Section 409A to allow for tax deferral. In no event shall an outstanding Option or Stock Appreciation Right for which the exercise price is less than the Fair Market Value of a Share be cancelled in exchange for cash or, except as provided in Section 5(e), replaced with a new Option or Stock Appreciation Right with a lower exercise price, without approval of the Company s shareholders. 
 (c) Except as noted in Section 11(f), the Committee shall be authorized to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, Awards in recognition of events (including, without limitation, the events described in Section 5(e)) affecting the Company, or the financial statements of the Company, or of changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles, whenever the Committee determines that such adjustments are appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan. 
 (d) Any provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in connection with a Business Combination, the Committee may cause any Award granted hereunder to be canceled in consideration of a cash payment or alternative Award made to the holder of such canceled Award equal in value to the Fair Market Value of such canceled Award. 
 (e) The Committee may correct any defect, supply any omission, or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or any Award in the manner and to the extent it shall deem desirable to carry the Plan into effect or to otherwise comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A so as to avoid adverse tax consequences under Code Section 409A. 
 Section 13. Confidentiality, Non-Solicitation and Non-Compete. 
 By accepting an Award under the Plan, a Participant agrees, understands, and acknowledges that the Participant shall be bound by, and shall abide by the Restrictive Covenants. In the event that a Participant breaches any applicable Restrictive Covenant, the Company may claw back or recoup any vested and unvested Awards granted under the Plan to such Participant (including any amounts or benefits arising from such Award) in accordance with Section 14. 
 Section 14. Clawback Policy Recoupment 
 14 

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, any Award granted under the Plan (including any amounts or benefits arising from such Award) shall be subject to potential cancellation, recoupment, rescission, payback or other action in accordance with the terms of the Company s Policy Regarding the Recovery of Compensation, as it may be amended from time to time, or any similar policy or policies established by the Company that may apply to the Participant (referred to as the Policy ). By accepting an Award under the Plan, a Participant agrees and consents to the Company s application, implementation and enforcement of (i) the Policy and (ii) any provision of applicable law relating to cancellation, rescission, payback or recoupment of compensation, and expressly agrees that the Company may take such actions as are necessary to effectuate the Policy or applicable law without further consent or action being required by the Participant. The Company s rights under the Policy shall be in addition to, and not in substitution of, the Company s rights under the Plan or otherwise and, in all events, the terms of the Policy shall prevail to the extent that the terms of the Policy conflict with the Plan or any other plan, program, agreement or arrangement. 
 Section 15. Miscellaneous . 
 (a) No employee, Participant or other person shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of employees, Participants, or holders or beneficiaries of Awards under the Plan. The terms and conditions of Awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient. 
 (b) The Committee may delegate to one or more officers or managers of the Company, or a committee of such officers or managers, the authority, subject to such terms and limitations as the Committee shall determine, to grant Awards to, or to cancel, modify, waive rights with respect to, alter, discontinue, suspend or terminate Awards held by, employees who are not officers or directors of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Committee may delegate to one or more officers or managers of the Company, or a committee of such officers or managers, the authority, subject to such terms and limitations as the Committee shall determine, authority to carry out a specified part or parts of its administrative responsibilities or ministerial functions in connection with the Plan, including but not limited to determining whether the conditions to forfeit an Award have been met and whether any Restrictive Covenant has been breached and any remedy for such breach. Any delegation of authority may be removed by the Committee at any time with or without cause. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) any delegation to management with respect to the Plan shall conform with the requirements of the corporate law of New Jersey and with the requirements, if any, of the New York Stock Exchange, in either case as in effect from time to time, (2) interpretations or determinations with respect to an executive officer s rights under an Award or the Plan shall be made by the Committee, and (3) if any action or direction of any person to whom authority hereunder has been delegated conflicts with an action or direction of the Committee, then the authority of the Committee shall supersede that of the delegate with respect to such action or direction. Any action taken by a person under an authorized delegation of authority in compliance with this Section 15.2(b) shall have the same force and effect as if taken directly by the Committee. 
 (c) The Company shall be authorized to withhold from any Award granted or any payment due or transfer made under any Award or under the Plan or from any compensation or other amount owing to a Participant the amount (in cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards, or other property) of withholding taxes due in respect of an Award, its exercise, or any payment or transfer under such Award or under the Plan and to take such other action (including, without limitation, providing for elective payment of such amounts in cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards or other property by the Participant) as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such taxes. 
 15 

(d) Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company from adopting or continuing in effect other or additional compensation arrangements, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases. 
 (e) The grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any Affiliate. Further, the Company or the applicable Affiliate may at any time dismiss a Participant from employment, free from any liability, or any claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in any Award Agreement or in any other agreement binding the parties. The receipt of any Award under the Plan is not intended to confer any rights on the receiving Participant except as set forth in such Award. 
 (f) If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or as to any person or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, person or Award, and the remainder of the Plan and any such Award shall remain in full force and effect. 
 (g) Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and a Participant or any other person. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company. 
 (h) No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award, and the Committee shall determine whether cash, other securities or other property shall be paid or transferred in lieu of any fractional Shares, or whether such fractional Shares or any rights thereto shall be canceled, terminated or otherwise eliminated. 
 Section 16. Effective Date of Plan . 
 The Plan shall be effective as of the date of its approval by the stockholders of the Company. 
 Section 17. Term of the Plan . 
 No Award shall be granted under the Plan after January 25, 2033. However, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in an applicable Award Agreement, any Award theretofore granted may extend beyond such date, and the authority of the Committee to amend, alter, adjust, suspend, discontinue, or terminate any such Award, or to waive any conditions or rights under any such Award, and the authority of the Board to amend the Plan, shall extend beyond such date.
