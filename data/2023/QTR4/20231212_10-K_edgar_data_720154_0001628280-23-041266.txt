 RISK FACTORS SUMMARY 
 Our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties, which may affect our future financial performance or condition. If any of the events or circumstances described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K occur, our business and financial performance or condition could be adversely affected, our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face. There may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material that may adversely affect our business and financial performance. We have provided a summary of some of these risks below. 
 Our business, results of operations, financial condition, including the carrying value of certain of our assets, and cash flows have and may continue to be adversely affected by our dependence on the importation of NHPs from suppliers located outside the U.S., particularly from communist countries in Southeast Asia, legal issues related to these suppliers and any inability to diversify our suppliers located outside the U.S. 
 We are involved in legal proceedings that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 We are subject to inspections, investigations and enforcement actions by regulatory authorities, which could lead to penalties, including substantial fines, warning letters, a temporary restraining order or injunction, civil and/or criminal penalties, and/or license suspension or revocation. 
 We are subject to environmental, health and safety requirements and risks as a result of which we may incur significant costs, liabilities and obligations. 
 Any failure by us to comply with existing regulations could harm our reputation and operating results, and requirements to comply with new laws, regulations and guidance may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical industry could change the demand for the services we provide. 
 If we fail to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 We have experienced periods of losses and financial insecurity. 
 We have incurred significant additional indebtedness during recent periods, which may impair our ability to raise further capital or impact our ability to service our debt. 
 Our credit agreement contains covenants that restrict our business and financing activities. All of our assets secure our obligations under the credit agreement and may be subject to foreclosure. 
 Our failure to comply with the terms of our Credit Agreement could result in an event of default that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 due to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to remediate these material weaknesses and maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and materially and adversely affect our business and financial results. 
 We rely on a limited number of key clients, the importance of which may vary dramatically from year to year, and a loss of one or more of these key clients may adversely affect our operating results. 
 We operate in a highly competitive industry. 
 The majority of our clients contracts and orders can be terminated upon short notice. 
 We may bear financial risk if we underprice our contracts or overrun cost estimates. 
 Our business uses biological and hazardous materials, which could injure people or violate laws, resulting in liability that could adversely impact our financial condition and business. 
 Our animal populations may suffer diseases that can damage our inventory, harm our reputation, result in decreased sales of our services or research products or result in other liability.

Tab l e o f Contents 

 Failure to manage our growth effectively could cause our business to suffer and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 Providing CROs creates a risk of liability. 
 New technologies may be developed, validated and increasingly used in biomedical research that could reduce demand for some of our products and services. 
 Our non-U.S. locations account for a significant percentage of our revenues, exposing us to risks associated with operating internationally. 
 Some of our clients and contracts depend on government funding of research and development and a reduction in that funding may adversely affect our business. 
 We have and may further expand our business through acquisitions, which exposes us to various risks. Our due diligence of our past or future acquisitions may not have identified all pertinent risks, or the full magnitude of such risks, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. 
 We may need additional capital, and any additional capital we seek may not be available in the amount or at the time we need it. 
 The Company may fail to realize anticipated strategic and financial benefits from acquisitions, related integrations and our site optimization strategy. 
 We are substantially dependent on the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. 
 Our future success depends on our ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes that could make our services and products less competitive or obsolete. 
 Actions of animal rights activists may affect our business. 
 We are at risk of cyber-attacks or other security breaches that could compromise sensitive business information, undermine our ability to operate effectively and expose us to liability, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer. 
 Hardware or software failures, delays in the operations of our computer and communications systems or the failure to implement system enhancements could harm our business. 
 Our business, results of operations, financial condition, including the carrying value of certain of our assets, cash flows and stock price have and may continue to be adversely affected by pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies. 
 Our share price could continue to be volatile and our trading volume may fluctuate substantially. 
 Our principal shareholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over matters subject to shareholder approval. 
 The resale of certain shares issued in the Envigo acquisition and covered by a resale registration statement could adversely affect the market price of our common shares, which result could in turn negatively affect our ability to raise additional equity capital. 
 Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and under Indiana law may discourage or prevent a change in control, even if a sale of us would benefit our shareholders, which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by shareholders to replace or remove our current management. 
 If we are unable to maintain listing of our securities on The Nasdaq Capital Market or another reputable stock exchange, it may be more difficult for our shareholders to sell their securities.

 PART I 
 
 ITEM 1 BUSINESS 
 Corporate History 
 Inotiv, Inc. and its subsidiaries we, our, us, the Company, or Inotiv began operating in 1975 as Bioanalytical Systems, Inc. Bioanalytical Systems, Inc. was incorporated in 1974 and completed an initial public offering in 2000. On March 18, 2021, the Company changed its corporate name from Bioanalytical Systems, Inc. to Inotiv, Inc. Our stock is traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol NOTV. We are headquartered in West Lafayette, Indiana. Our headquarters mailing address is 2701 Kent Avenue, West Lafayette, Indiana 47906, and the telephone number at that location is (765) 463-4527. Our Internet site is www.inotivco.com. The information contained on our website is not a part of this Report and is not incorporated by reference herein. 
 Overview 
 Inotiv is a leading contract research organization CRO dedicated to providing nonclinical and analytical drug discovery and development services primarily to the pharmaceutical and medical device industries and selling a range of research-quality animals and diets to the same industries as well as academia and government clients. Our products and services enable the discovery and development of new drugs and medical devices and facilitate better understanding of disease biology, all while focusing on increasing efficiency, improving data, and reducing the cost of discovering and taking new drugs and medical devices to market. Inotiv is committed to supporting discovery and development objectives as well as helping researchers realize the full potential of their critical research and development projects, all while working together to build a healthier and safer world. We are dedicated to practicing high standards of laboratory animal care and welfare. 
 As a result of our strategic acquisition of Envigo RMS Holding Corp. Envigo in November 2021, which added a complementary research model platform, our full spectrum solutions now span two segments: Discovery and Safety Assessment DSA and Research Models and Services RMS ). 
 6 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 Through our DSA segment, we support the discovery, nonclinical development and clinical development needs of researchers and clinicians for primarily small molecule drug candidates, as well as biotherapeutics and biomedical devices. Our scientists have skills in analytical instrumentation development, chemistry, computer software development, histology, pathology, physiology, surgery, analytical chemistry, drug metabolism, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology to make the services and products we provide increasingly valuable to our current and potential clients. Our principal clients are companies whose scientists are engaged in analytical chemistry, drug safety evaluation, clinical trials, drug metabolism studies, pharmacokinetics and basic research, from small start-up biotechnology companies to some of the largest global pharmaceutical companies. 
 
 Through our RMS segment, we offer access to a wide range of small and large research models for basic research and drug discovery and development, as well as specialized models for specific diseases and therapeutic areas. We combine deep animal husbandry expertise with extensive knowledge and expertise in managing breeding genetics and high health status facilities, geared toward the delivery of high quality laboratory animals for research. In conjunction with our CRO business, we have the ability to run selected nonclinical studies directly on-site at closely located research model facilities and provide access to innovative genetically engineered models and services solutions. Our principal clients include biopharmaceutical companies, CROs, and academic and government organizations. 
 During the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, we focused our efforts on our site optimization strategy, which includes 11 facilities in addition to the exit of our Israel businesses, the completion of the build-out of a newly leased 48,000 square foot facility in Rockville, Maryland Rockville and addressing the shortage of nonhuman primate research models. As of September 30, 2023, we had completed the sale of the Israel businesses and the closure and consolidation of seven U.S. facilities and the facilities in France, Italy and Spain. One of our U.K. facilities is expected to close and consolidate with our other U.K. facility by the end of March. The facility build-out at Rockville was substantially complete in March 2023, and we are continuing to validate the equipment and assays required to support growth in both the genetic toxicology and biotherapeutics businesses. 
 Discovery and Safety Assessment 
 The DSA segment is comprised of two principal areas of services: Discovery Services Discovery and Safety Assessment. 
 Discovery Services 
 Analytical Method Development and Validation: Analytical methods are developed and validated in a manner designed to ensure that data generated are accurate, precise, reproducible and reliable and are used consistently throughout the drug development process and in later product support. Both early-stage, fit-for-purpose discovery methods and fully Good Laboratory Practice GLP )-validated methods are generated to provide appropriate and timely responses to the client s situation. 
 In Vivo Pharmacology : We provide preclinical in vivo efficacy services. In vivo pharmacology is strengthened by the combination of our genetically-modified rodent production capability which provides animals with specific genetic modifications necessary for evaluation of new molecular targets. 
 Exploratory Pharmacokinetics and Toxicology: We evaluate the initial pharmacokinetics of drug candidates to determine oral bioavailability, dose proportionality of exposure, gender differences, and time-dependent changes in exposure in our laboratories. In addition we provide initial safety evaluation of drug candidates through the conduct of single and repeated dose exploratory toxicology studies designed to identify tolerability and target organ toxicity and to provide guidance for dosing of more extensive pivotal studies which are intended to support human clinical trials. 
 Archiving Services: We provide climate-controlled archiving services for our clients data and samples at all of our facilities. 
 Analytical Products: Analytical products consist of our liquid chromatographic and electrochemical instruments with associated accessories. The critical component of these products is the Epsilon electrochemical platform. This platform incorporates all the hardware capabilities needed for most electrochemical experiments but can be modified through software development. The market for our analytical products is comprised principally of academic institutions and industrial research companies. 
 7 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 In Vivo Sampling Products: In vivo sampling products consist of the Culex family of automated in vivo sampling and dosing instruments. These instruments are used by pharmaceutical researchers to dose animals and collect biological samples (blood, bile, urine, microdialysate, feces or any bio-fluid) from the animals. Since dosing and sample collections are automated, animals are not manually handled, reducing stress on the animals and producing more representative pharmacological data. Behavior and other physiological parameters can also be monitored simultaneously. Compared to manual methods, the Culex products offer significant reduction in test model use and comparable reduction in labor. The line also includes in vivo sampling devices sold to drug developers and medical research centers to assist in the study of a number of medical conditions including stroke, depression, Alzheimer s and Parkinson s diseases, diabetes and osteoporosis. 
 Safety Assessment 
 Non-clinical Toxicology and Pathology Services : We provide safety testing in studies ranging from acute safety evaluation of drugs and medical devices to chronic, multi-year oncogenicity studies, and safety evaluation focused on developmental and reproductive toxicology. We also provide services in toxicologic pathology and evaluation of tissues from animal efficacy models, surgical modeling and focused evaluation of biomedical devices as well as cardiovascular safety evaluation in radiotelemetry-implanted animals. 
 Stability Testing : We test stability of nonclinical drug dosing formulations and collect bioanalysis samples designed to ensure the integrity of all solutions used in nonclinical and clinical studies and post-study analyses. Results from sample shipping and storage studies assist our clients in maintaining sample integrity throughout the process from collection to analysis. 
 Drug Metabolism, Bioanalysis, and Pharmacokinetics Testing : We analyze samples from in vitro, preclinical and clinical studies to identify and measure drug and metabolite concentrations in complex biological matrices, including drug metabolism, bioanalysis and pharmacokinetics studies. 
 New Service Offerings 
 During the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we spent 6.9 million and 5.7 million, respectively, on startup costs for new service offerings that we are building internally such as: mechanistic pharmacology and toxicology, safety pharmacology; juvenile toxicology; SEND (Standard for the Exchange of Nonclinical Data) data reporting; clinical pathology; biotherapeutics; histopathology for devices; genetic toxicology; and cardiovascular safety pharmacology. 
 Research Models and Services 
 The RMS segment is comprised of (1) Research Models, (2) Diets and Bedding, and (3) Research Model Services. 
 Research Models: Our research models business is comprised of the commercial production and sale of laboratory animals and research models, principally purpose-bred rats and mice and large animal models (non-human primates NHP and rabbits) for use by researchers. We provide these models to numerous clients around the world, including many academic institutions, government agencies, biopharmaceutical companies, and CROs, and we have a global footprint with production facilities strategically located in three countries. 
 Our research models include standard stocks and strains, immunocompromised models (which are useful for oncology research), disease models (which are in demand as early-stage research tools) and genetically-engineered models (( GEMS ), which are often created for specific research projects). 
 Small Animal Research Models : Our rodent species have been and continue to be among the most-used research models in the world, largely as a result of our geographic footprint and commitment to quality and client service. Our small animal research models are bred and maintained in controlled environments, which are designed to ensure that the models are free of specific viral and bacterial agents, and other contaminants that can disrupt research operations and distort research results. With our production capabilities, we strive to consistently deliver high-quality research models worldwide. 
 RMS rodent research models include: 
 outbred, which are purposefully bred for heterogeneity; 
 8 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 inbred, which are bred to be genetically identical; 
 spontaneous mutant, which contain a naturally occurring genetic mutation (such as immune deficiency); 
 hybrid, which are the offspring of two different inbred parents; and 
 GEMS. 
 Certain of our models are proprietary, disease-specific rodent models used to research treatments for diseases such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular and kidney disease. 
 Large Research Models: Our large animal portfolio includes NHPs and rabbits. NHPs are generally imported into the U.S. and Europe from Asia and Africa, with limited breeding in the U.S. We operate two quarantine facilities in the U.S. to house and clear these imported animals before onward shipment to clients. NHPs are used by our clients primarily for the safety testing of new biological therapies. Rabbits are bred in both the U.K. and U.S. and utilized primarily for the reproductive safety testing of potential new therapies. 
 Diets and Bedding: Through its Teklad product line Teklad ), RMS produces and sells laboratory animal diets, bedding, and enrichment products. With primary manufacturing operations in the U.S. and a primarily company-owned and/or managed distribution network throughout the U.S., U.K. and Europe, we distribute Teklad products globally. We also maintain contract-manufacturing relationships with companies in the U.K. and Italy. 
 Teklad offers a full line of off-the-shelf formulations as well as custom diets to meet our clients specific research needs. A team of nutritionists, including several PhDs, work with our clients to determine the best diet for their research objectives. If a custom diet is required, our nutritionists define the appropriate formula and our custom diet manufacturing line produces the feed. Our manufacturing facilities are ISO 9001:2015 certified. 
 Teklad diets are manufactured from natural ingredients and use fixed formulas. In conjunction with strict quality standards for raw materials, this approach helps to ensure quality and consistency by minimizing variability of both nutrients and certain natural chemicals in the diet which might affect a research study. Teklad offers a variety of bedding and enrichment products to support model breeding, weaning, and holding. 
 Research Model Services: We also offer a variety of services designed to support our clients' use of research models in basic research and product development. These services include specialized surgical modifications such as cannulation, implants, and the creation of surgically derived disease state models. We also provide contract breeding, contract colony management, health monitoring, quarantine, cryopreservation, rederivation and revitalization services, as well as antibody development and production. Lastly, through the GEMS business, we offer the creation of new transgenic research models specific to individual clients needs. 
 The Company s Role in the Drug Development Process 
 Inotiv provides research support, through provision of its products and services, for the identification and development of new chemical and biological entities from discovery through clinical development. Our DSA segment provides services related to efficacy and safety evaluations and our RMS segment offers animal research models for use in efficacy and safety evaluations. 
 1. The discovery phase of new product development includes the identification and validation of potential targets for therapeutic intervention, the latter of which may involve studying a disease s molecular pathway by genetically altering one or more of the molecules in that pathway in cell lines or in murine models. Inotiv s molecular biology group creates such murine models for our clients and, where appropriate, can then support clients in the use of those models to study the pharmacokinetic and potential efficacy profiles of new therapeutic entities. 
 In addition to generation of new models for studying potential pharmacokinetics and efficacy at the request of our clients, Inotiv also has a broad range of off-the-shelf standard, and disease-bearing models, that may be used for the same purposes. Our discovery services group uses these animals, and other model systems, to perform a range of early discovery tests to better characterize potential new therapeutic molecules for mode of action, potential efficacy, and predicted safety and metabolism profiles. 
 2. After a new drug candidate is identified and carried through this preliminary discovery screening, the development process for new drugs has three distinct phases: the nonclinical phase, the clinical phase and the post approval 
 9 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 phase. The nonclinical phase includes safety testing to prepare an Investigational New Drug ("IND") application for submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA ). The IND must be accepted by the FDA before the drug candidate can be initially tested in humans. Once a pharmacologically active molecule is fully analyzed to confirm its potential utility, the initial dosage form for clinical trials is created. An analytical chemistry method is developed to enable reliable quantification. Stability and purity of the formulation are also determined. 
 Clients work with our nonclinical services group to establish initial pharmacology, pharmacokinetics PK ), pharmacodynamics PD and safety characteristics of the drug candidate. The safety studies range from dose ranging studies, that involve acute safety evaluation of drug candidates and medical devices to chronic, multi-year oncogenicity and reproductive toxicity studies. Dose formulation analysis is provided by our pharmaceutical analysis group. Bioanalyses of blood sampled under these protocols by our bioanalytical services group provide pharmacokinetic and metabolism data that is used with the safety and toxicity information to determine the exposure required to demonstrate toxicity. A no observable adverse effect level is then established for the drug and sets the basis for future safety testing and clinical Phase I studies. Upon successful completion of nonclinical safety studies, an IND submission is made by the sponsor and must be approved by FDA prior to initiation of human clinical trials. 
 Our bioanalytical services group utilizes our depth of expertise in liquid chromatography with detection by mass spectrometry to support research, nonclinical and clinical programs. We also offer bioanalytical services that utilize electrochemistry, spectrophotometric (UV/Vis or fluorescence) and Corona Discharge detection as options. We have invested in robotics and mass spectrometry systems. Application of this technology allows us to rapidly develop and validate methods for new compounds and obtain information suitable for regulatory submission. 
 3. The clinical phase further explores the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate in humans. The sponsor conducts Phase I human clinical trials in a limited number of healthy individuals to determine safety and tolerability. Bioanalytical assays determine the availability and metabolism of the active ingredient following administration. Expertise in method development and validation is critical for new chemical entities and new biological entities. 
 Exhaustive safety, tolerability and dosing regimens are established in patients in Phase II trials. Phase III clinical trials verify efficacy and safety. After successful completion of Phase III trials, the sponsor of the new drug submits a New Drug Application ("NDA") or Biologics License Application ("BLA") to the FDA requesting that the product be approved for marketing. The bioanalytical sample count per study grows rapidly from Phase I through Phase III. Phase II and III studies may take several years to complete, and must be supported by well-proven and consistently applied analytical methods. 
 In parallel with the conduct of Phase II and Phase III clinical development, additional nonclinical animal studies (including sub-chronic and chronic toxicology studies, carcinogenicity studies and reproductive toxicology studies) are performed to allow the drug to proceed through clinical development and to support product registration. 
 Our services supporting clinical development include evaluation of bioequivalence and bioavailability to monitor the rate and extent to which a drug is available in the body and to demonstrate that the availability is consistent between formulations. We also offer in-vitro bioequivalence testing for poorly absorbed topical and oral drugs. We offer support and testing services in clinical sample development, release and stability. 
 4. The post-approval phase follows FDA approval of the NDA or BLA. This includes production and continued analytical and clinical monitoring of the drug. The post-approval phase also includes development and regulatory approval of product modifications and line extensions, including improved dosage forms. The drug manufacturer must comply with quality assurance and quality control requirements throughout production and must continue analytical and stability studies of the drug during commercial production to continue to validate production processes and confirm product shelf life. Samples from each manufactured batch must be tested prior to release of the batch for distribution to the public. 
 We also provide services during the post-approval phase, including bioequivalence studies of new formulations, line extensions, new disease indications and drug interaction studies. Our ability to offer Good Manufacturing Process ("GMP") electrochemical detection services has provided increased business opportunities for release testing.

 Increases in our services offerings have resulted in our ability to provide a broader range of services to our clients, often using combined services of several disciplines to address program needs. Our ability to solve problems by combining our knowledge base, services and products has been a factor in our selection by small startup biotechnology companies and major pharmaceutical companies to assist in several preclinical through post-approval phases. 
 Clients 
 
 We provide our services and products to organizations engaged in basic research, biomedical device and pharmaceutical research and development. During the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, we made sales to over 2,500 companies, ranging from emerging biopharmaceutical companies up to some of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. We discuss client concentration and geographic information related to our business in Note 5 Segment and Geographic Information to our consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8. 
 
 Recurring business from existing clients is important to ongoing operations. Our clients needs for our services and products increase and decrease depending on the stage of their research activities, so we experience some client turnover. Our business development efforts focus on both expanding existing client relationships and acquiring new clients. Historically, our RMS segment has stable, long-term relationships with a majority of our clients due to their overarching preference for consistency in the products they use to conduct their studies. However, we are continuing our efforts to cross-sell and expand our client base. Our DSA segment, due to its broad menu of services and flexibility in study design, is well positioned to serve the emerging biopharmaceutical segment during the discovery and development phases. We discuss client concentration of revenue in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8. 
 
 Contractual Arrangements 
 
 Our DSA contracts typically establish an estimated fee to be paid for a proposed set of services designed in consultation with the client. In most cases, some percentage of the contract fee is paid in advance. While we are performing a contract, clients often adjust the scope of services to be provided based on interim project results. Fees are adjusted accordingly. Generally, our fee-for-service contracts are terminable by the client upon written notice of 30 days or less for a variety of reasons, including the client s decision to forego a particular study, the failure of product prototypes to satisfy safety requirements, and unexpected or undesired results of product testing. Cancellation or delay of ongoing contracts may result in fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results. We are generally able to recover, at a minimum, our invested costs when contracts are terminated. 
 
 Our RMS product contracts are typically short-term in nature and based upon purchase orders submitted by clients to satisfy specific requirements for their research. Pricing is based upon list prices, which are market-adjusted. In addition, prior to Inotiv s acquisition of Envigo, Envigo entered into a five-year supplier agreement with a key strategic partner that includes minimum purchase commitments and preferred pricing (equal to best price extended to similar clients). The contract s initial term ends during the third fiscal quarter 2024. However, it requires a two-year termination notice. Contract breeding and client-owned animal colony care contracts are generally billed as per diems over the contract period. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We promote our services through concentrated business development efforts, scientist-to-scientist communications, centralized corporate marketing programs and social media to both pharmaceutical and medical device companies, as well as academic and government research institutions. We recognize that our growth depends upon our ability to continually improve client satisfaction in order to deepen existing and establish new client relationships. 
 In November of 2019, the Company rebranded its contract research services business as Inotiv. Adoption of the trade name Inotiv symbolized the expansion and supplementation of the Company s legacy contract research service operations through significant business acquisitions as well as internal growth. Since the rebranding, the Company has marketed and otherwise managed its contract research services operations under the name Inotiv. On March 18, 2021, the Company changed its corporate name from Bioanalytical Systems, Inc. to Inotiv, Inc. Our research equipment manufacturing division continues to operate under the name BASi Research Products. 
 The Company acquired Envigo RMS Holding Corp in November of 2021. After its acquisition, the research models business of Envigo has continued to operate under the Envigo brand as an Inotiv company and comprises the majority of 
 11 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 the RMS segment of Inotiv. Since March of 2023, the Company has worked to consolidate all DSA and RMS products and services under the Inotiv trade mark, as evidenced by the launch of a unified website under the Inotiv domain. 
 Our commercial initiatives include integrated campaigns designed to help differentiate and promote our products and services. Through trade events, digital and print advertising, direct communication, newsletters, social media, virtual exhibit space and our website, we provide our perspective on current industry challenges and developments to create an ongoing dialogue with our clients and to promote our industry expertise, quality, technology and innovation. Historically, we have reinforced key messages and selling points through client visits, presentations, corporate material and at trade events and industry conferences. While trade events were almost entirely virtual from 2020 through 2022, nearly all have returned to in-person events. 
 We encourage and sponsor the participation of our scientific and technical personnel in a variety of professional endeavors, including in-person (seminar) and virtual (webinar) speaking engagements, the presentation of papers at national and international professional trade meetings and the publication of scientific articles in medical and pharmaceutical journals. Through these endeavors we seek to emphasize our reputation for both scientific depth and operational excellence. 
 As of September 30, 2023, in addition to our leadership team and scientists, we had 135 employees on our commercial team supporting sales, marketing, client experience, client service and program management for both our DSA and RMS clients. These resources are located in both North America and U.K./Europe to serve major research markets. 
 Competition 
 Our two operating segments compete with other businesses, which range in size and capabilities, both financial and operational. In addition to competing companies in both industries, we compete with internal research and development teams at our client companies. There is competition for clients on the basis of many factors, including scientific and technological expertise, quality, reputation, responsiveness, price, scope of product and related service offerings, and geographic presence. Further, specific to the RMS segment, we believe there are significant barriers to becoming a global provider including the construction of bio-secure barrier production facilities, flexible-film isolator production facilities and the population of these facilities with over 175 species and strains of animal models (including over 80 genetically engineered rodent models), which requires years of investment and strict operating procedures. 
 For DSA, we have many competitors, including two public companies in the U.S. and one public company in China. 
 For RMS, there are five main competitors, including one public company in the U.S., two privately-held companies in the U.S., one government-funded, not-for-profit entity in the U.S., and one privately-held company in Europe. 
 Industry Support and Animal Welfare 
 Inotiv is committed to delivering high-level health and genetic quality, operational performance and client service. High standards of animal welfare are vital to delivering on each of these objectives and are a principal focus of Inotiv. 
 Inotiv is an advocate for implementation of Replacement, Reduction and Refinement 3Rs ). Members of Inotiv's scientific and technical care staff undertake continuing professional development in the field of laboratory animal science, with special focus on animal welfare and the 3Rs, and they are encouraged to publish and present within the scientific community. 
 Inotiv has formed internal Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees, comprising staff from many disciplines within the DSA and RMS segments, in addition to external representation, to implement applicable regulations and provide strict oversight of animal welfare matters. The majority of Inotiv s animal production facilities are accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International AAALAC ), a private, non-profit, international accrediting organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs. Our facilities are also routinely inspected by government agencies tasked with enforcing animal welfare regulations. 
 Inotiv is firmly committed to the 3Rs and to reducing the number of animals used in research by emphasizing health and genetic integrity to decrease study data variability. Whenever possible, technological advances, such as new diagnostic tests for screening pathogens in laboratory rodents, micro-sampling and in vitro assays, are used.

 Laboratory animals remain an essential component in the research and development that our clients conduct. They further our knowledge of living systems and help in the discovery and development of products that can save or enhance human and animal lives. The Company works with the scientific community to improve our understanding and promote best practice in the care and welfare of research animals. As providers of research models to the research community and scientists conducting experiments on behalf of our clients to help discover and develop new medicines, Inotiv is responsible to our clients and the public for the health and well-being of the animals in our care. 
 Human Capital Management 
 As of September 30, 2023, we had 1,955 full-time employees and 100 part-time employees. All employees enter into confidentiality agreements intended to protect our proprietary information. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. Our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified professional, scientific and technical staff. The level of competition among employers for skilled personnel is high. We believe that our employee benefit plans enhance employee morale, professional commitment and work productivity and provide an incentive for employees to remain with the Company. 
 Our primary objectives and philosophy of our compensation programs are to (i) drive leadership behaviors that maximize long-term stockholder value creation and (ii) attract and retain talented colleagues with the skills necessary to successfully manage and grow our business. 
 Attracting, retaining, and developing talent is a core principle of our talent management and total rewards strategy. Compensation and benefit programs are an important part of our employment relationship, which also includes challenging and rewarding work, growth and career development opportunities and being part of a leading CRO with a diverse and talented workforce that helps clients develop life-changing therapies. We strive to have the following features as part of our compensation and benefits: 
 a consistent framework that is affordable to the business; 
 a pay for performance focus individuals are rewarded for performance and overall contributions to business success; 
 compensation is fair and equitable, irrespective of gender, race, or similar personal characteristics; and 
 a total rewards package that will be competitive with leading companies. 
 Compensation is used to attract, retain, and motivate employees and to reward the achievement of business results through the delivery of competitive pay and discretionary incentive programs. Benefits provide employees with income security and protection from catastrophic loss. We will continue to evaluate and develop affordable, competitive benefit programs that meet these objectives. No one element is more important than any other, and business judgement is used to balance them to ensure our compensation and benefits strategy is effective in supporting our overall business strategy. 
 Our Guiding Principles consist of: 
 Pay Equity employee compensation should be fair and equitable. 
 Performance Orientation compensation programs should support and reinforce a pay-for-performance culture. 
 Competitive Positioning critical to attracting, motivating, and retaining a high-performance team. 
 Affordability compensation and benefits must be affordable to us over the medium to long-term. 
 Consistency and Stability compensation and benefit programs should have a high degree of consistency and should not significantly fluctuate year-over-year. 
 Delivery Efficiency compensation, benefits, and other related programs should be consistent, equitable and easy to administer. 
 Deliver Effectiveness clearly defined metrics should be developed for compensation, benefits, and other related programs that are aligned with corporate business performance metrics. 
 Attracting, retaining, and developing world class talent that is empowered to work together to compete and win is a fundamental aspect of our corporate strategy. A foundational principle of our talent management strategy is an unwavering

 commitment to equal opportunity in all aspects of employment, including the way we compensate and reward our employees. 
 Regulatory Matters 
 We are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations and inspections designed to promote compliance therewith. We strive to conduct our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations may result in sanctions, including substantial fines, warning letters that require corrective action (including potential facilities improvement requirements), revocation of approvals, exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs and grants, criminal prosecution and even the denial or debarment of the right to conduct business. We hold a range of permits and licenses, related to our activities. 
 We are subject to extensive regulatory requirements designed to ensure the quality and integrity of our data and products and to government inspections and audits related thereto. These regulations include those promulgated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended from time to time, and include GLP, GMP, Bioequivalence regulations BE and Good Clinical Practices ("GCP"). These requirements demand rigorous attention to research; development; safety; manufacturing quality control; employee training; detailed documentation; equipment and computer validation; promotion and advertising; careful tracking of changes and routine auditing of compliance. Noncompliance with these standards could result in disqualification of project data collected by the Company, which would substantially impact our ability to meet our obligations to clients, and, in severe cases, discontinuance of selected operations. The products and services we offer to international clients are also subject to foreign regulatory requirements, which vary from country to country. Since our formation, we have been inspected, on a routine basis, by the FDA at each of our locations. 
 We are subject to federal, state and foreign healthcare and other regulations, including anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws (such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977), and could face substantial penalties if we fail to comply with such regulations and laws. In particular, the relationships that we, and third parties that market and/or sell our products, have with purchasers of our products, are subject to scrutiny under various state and federal laws, including those referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws. 
 Our facilities and operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to protection of human health and the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the environment and the storage, handling, use, treatment, disposal, and recycling of hazardous substances and wastes, as well as relating to the humane treatment of animals in our custody, as further described below. Such laws include, without limitation, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Animal Welfare Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. As environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve, it is likely we will be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future, particularly under air and water quality laws and standards related to climate change issues. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time. 
 Analytical Services 
 Laboratories that provide information included in INDs, NDAs and BLAs must conform to regulatory requirements that are designed to ensure the quality and integrity of the testing process. Most of our contract research services are subject to government standards for laboratory practices that are embodied in regulations for GLP, GMP, BE and GCP. The FDA, Environmental Protection Agency and other regulatory authorities require that test results submitted to such authorities be based on studies conducted in accordance with the regulations listed above. These requirements include but are not restricted to the following areas: 
 Resources organization, personnel, facilities and equipment; 
 Rules protocols and written procedures; 
 Characterization test items and test systems; 
 Documentation raw data, final report and archives; and 
 Quality assurance unit formalized internal audit function. 
 We must also maintain reports for each study for specified periods for auditing by the study sponsor and by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities in other parts of the world. Regulatory monitoring authorities such as the FDA, have 
 14 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 indicated an increased emphasis on the management of electronic records generated by computerized systems to ensure data integrity. Noncompliance with these regulations can result in the disqualification of data collected during the preclinical trial, which would substantially impact our ability to meet our obligations to clients, and, in severe cases, discontinuance of selected operations. 
 Nonclinical Services 
 Our animal research facilities are subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations, including The Animal Welfare Act AWA and the rules and regulations enforced by the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") and the National Institutes of Health ("NIH"). These regulations establish the standards for the humane treatment, care and handling of animals by breeders, dealers and research facilities. Our animal research facilities maintain detailed standard operating procedures and other documentation designed to comply with applicable regulations for the humane treatment of the animals in our custody. If the USDA determines that our equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable AWA standards, it may issue an inspection report documenting the deficiencies and setting deadlines for any required corrective actions. For continued noncompliance, the USDA may impose fines, suspend and/or revoke animal research licenses or confiscate research animals. In addition to being licensed by the USDA as a research facility where applicable, we have registered assurances with the NIH. 
 Research Models and Services 
 As the RMS segment operates in a number of distinct environments and in a variety of locations worldwide, the RMS segment is subject to numerous, and sometimes overlapping, regulatory environments. 
 The AWA governs the care and use of certain species of animals used for research in the U.S. other than certain laboratory rats, mice and birds. For regulated species, the AWA and the associated animal care regulations require producers and users of regulated species to provide veterinary care and to utilize specific husbandry practices such as cage size, shipping conditions, sanitation and environmental enrichment to assure the welfare of these animals. Separately, facilities using live vertebrate animals in research funded by the U.S. Public Health Service PHS must also adhere to the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and follow the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals produced by the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research. 
 The RMS segment is subject to licensing and registration requirement standards set by the USDA and similar agencies in other countries for the care and use of regulated species. Our operations in Europe are subject to the standards as stipulated by Directive 2010/63/EU on the Protection of Animals Used for Scientific Purposes. Stipulations within that Directive were transposed into national legislations within Europe in 2013. We are regularly consulted and inspected by the relevant national authorities in each nation in which we operate. 
 The RMS segment's import and export of animals and its operations in foreign countries are subject to international agreements and conventions, as well as a variety of national, regional, and local laws and regulations, which establish the standards for the humane treatment, care, handling and transport of animals by breeders, dealers and research facilities. 
 In addition, the specific activities of some of RMS lines of business require RMS entities to hold specialized licenses for the conduct, manufacture, and distribution of particular products and services. 
 All of RMS s sites are subject to licensing and regulation under international treaties and conventions, including national, regional and local laws relating to: 
 the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens; 
 the handling, use, storage and disposal of chemicals (including anesthetics, narcotics and psychotropic drugs), biological reagents, laboratory specimens, hazardous waste and radioactive materials; 
 the safety and health of employees and visitors to our facilities; and 
 protection of the environment and general public. 
 To meet these compliance obligations, Inotiv has established quality assurance procedures and functions. The quality assurance function operates independently from those individuals that manage RMS production.

 Controlled, Hazardous, and Environmentally Threatening Substances 
 Some of our development and testing activities are subject to the Controlled Substances Act administered by the Drug Enforcement Agency ("DEA"), which strictly regulates all narcotic and habit-forming substances. We maintain restricted-access facilities and heightened control procedures for projects involving such substances due to the level of security and other controls required by the DEA. 
 Our laboratories are subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws relating to hazard communication and employee right-to-know regulations, the handling and disposal of medical specimens and hazardous waste, as well as the safety and health of laboratory employees. All of our laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to the storage and disposal of laboratory specimens, including regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, the National Fire Protection Agency and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. We may incur liability for alleged environmental damages associated with the off-site transportation and disposal of hazardous substances. Generators of hazardous substances which are transported to disposal sites where environmental problems are alleged to exist are subject to claims under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 CERCLA ), and state counterparts. CERCLA imposes strict, joint and several liabilities for investigatory and cleanup costs upon hazardous substance generators, site owners and operators, and other potentially responsible parties. We may be held liable for all costs arising out of any release of hazardous substances and for consequences arising out of human exposure to such substances, which costs may be material. In addition, changes in any environmental laws may increase costs of compliance and liabilities arising from any past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances and may materially adversely affect the business. 
 The regulations of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the PHS and the U.S. Postal Service apply to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens. Our laboratories must also comply with the International Air Transport Association regulations which govern international shipments of laboratory specimens. Furthermore, when materials are sent to a foreign country, the transportation of such materials becomes subject to the laws, rules and regulations of such foreign country. 
 Safety 
 In addition to comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace generally, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers, whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus, chemicals and drugs, and respiratory hazards. These regulations, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to chemicals, transmission of blood-borne and airborne pathogens, and other potential hazards. Relevant employees receive initial and periodic training focusing on compliance with applicable hazardous materials regulations and health and safety guidelines. 
 Trends Affecting the Drug Discovery and Development Industry 
 Our services and products are primarily marketed globally to pharmaceutical, medical research and biotechnology companies and institutions (academic and governmental) engaged in drug research and development. The research services industry is highly fragmented among many niche vendors as well as a small number of consolidating larger companies; the latter offer an ever-growing portfolio of start-to-finish pharmaceutical development services. Our services and products may have distinctly different clients (including separate divisions in a single large pharmaceutical company) and requirements. We believe that market trends in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries demonstrate an increasing emphasis towards outsourcing, as companies seek to maintain reduced internal resources in favor of variable cost models that offer high quality and higher accountability alternatives to meet their drug discovery, development and manufacturing needs. We believe that our clients are facing increased pressure to outsource facets of their research and development activities and that the following factors are the main contributors to client outsourcing. 
 Limited Research Model Availability 
 During the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers and CROs experienced significant limitations in their access to animal research models, specifically including a sharp reduction in the availability of NHPs originating from breeding farms in Southeast Asia. Prior to the pandemic, China was the leading exporter of NHPs employed in basic and applied research; however, early in 2020, China ceased exportation of cynomolgus monkeys, the species most commonly involved in pharmaceutical product development. This change in the world supply of a critical research model has resulted in a need to 
 16 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 source increased numbers of NHPs from breeding farms principally located in Cambodia, Vietnam, and Mauritius Island, with a resultant marked increase in unit pricing. We do not know whether the embargo in China on exportation will loosen in the future. 
 On November 16, 2022, the Company became aware that the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Southern District of Florida USAO-SDFL had criminally charged employees of the principal supplier of NHPs to the Company , along with two Cambodian government officials, with conspiring to illegally import NHPs into the United States from December 2017 through January 2022 and in connection with seven specific imports between July 2018 and December 2021. In addition, two of the Company's subsidiaries, Orient BioResource Center, Inc. ("OBRC") and Envigo Global Services, Inc., companies acquired by the Company on January 27, 2022 and November 5, 2021, respectively, have received grand jury subpoenas from USAO-SDFL requiring the production of documents and information related to their importation of NHPs into the U.S. The Company understands that one of the Cambodian government officials is currently scheduled to be tried by the USAO-SDFL in March 2024. The indictment further jeopardized the already constrained domestic supply of these critical animal models. 
 The limited NHP supply initially brought on by halting of Chinese exports and exacerbated by the events in Cambodia also resulted in an increase in the cost of these animals during fiscal year 2023, which could limit the ability of small innovator companies to fund the initial safety evaluation of new product candidates. 
 Accelerated Drug Development 
 Clients continue to demand faster, more efficient, more selective development of an increasing pool of drug candidates. Consequently, our clients require fast, high-quality service in order to make well-informed decisions to quickly exclude poor candidates and speed development of promising ones. The need for additional development capacity to exploit more opportunities, accelerate development, extend market exclusivity and increase profitability drives the demand for outsourced services. 
 Increase in Potential New Drug Candidates 
 
 The time and cost required to develop a new drug or device candidate have generally increased. Many small and virtual pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies do not have sufficient internal resources to pursue development of all of the new drug candidates on their own. Consequently, these companies are looking to the drug discovery and development services industry for cost-effective, innovative and rapid means of developing new drugs. Looking to the future, as we continue to explore how we can better support our customers, and their development of novel medicines going forward, we have embarked on a program to standardize the capture of data generated in discovery, safety, and clinical studies. The goal of this program is to structure our data in a way that, in the future, may allow an AI approach to integrate them to find correlations between discovery and safety data, and clinical outcomes that can innovate and accelerate our translational medicine offering. 
 
 Cost Pressures of Introducing New Drugs 
 Market forces, healthcare reform and other governmental initiatives place significant pressures on pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to reduce drug prices. In addition, increased competition as a result of patent expiration, market acceptance of generic drugs, and governmental and privately managed care organization efforts to reduce healthcare costs have added to drug pricing pressures. The pharmaceutical industry is responding by consolidating, streamlining operations, decentralizing internal discovery and development processes, and minimizing fixed costs. In addition, increased pressures to differentiate products and justify drug pricing are resulting in an increased focus on healthcare economics, safety monitoring and commercialization services. Moreover, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are attempting to increase the speed and efficiency of internal new drug discovery and development processes. 
 Patent Expiration 
 As exclusivity ends with patent expiration, drug companies defend their proprietary positions against generic competition with various patent extension strategies. Both the drug company pursuing these extensions and the generic competitors provide additional opportunities for the Company. 
 17 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 Alliances 
 Strategic alliances allow pharmaceutical companies to share research know-how and to develop and market new drugs faster in more diverse, global markets. We believe that such alliances will lead to a greater number of potential drugs in testing, many under study by small and virtual companies lacking broad internal resources to conduct such testing. These small and virtual companies can seek to add shareholder value by further developing new products through outsourcing, reducing risk for potential allies. Clients seek realistic business partnerships with their service provider in an effort to ensure that costs are controlled and scientific continuity is maintained as their development programs progress. We have long-standing business relationships with many pharmaceutical companies, continue to offer flexible services and aim to adapt to our clients requirements. 
 Mergers and Acquisitions 
 Consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry as well as its supporting contract research industry is commonplace. As pharmaceutical industry firms blend personnel, resources and business activities, we believe they will continue to streamline operations and minimize staffing, which will lead to more outsourcing and a dependence on small and virtual drug discovery efforts to feed their pipelines. Consolidation may result in a disruption in the progress of drug development programs as merging companies rationalize their respective drug development pipelines. In addition, we believe that recent consolidation within the contract research industry has created a unique opportunity for the emergence of mid-market CRO providers who can offer clients a high degree of touch not only in study execution, but in program design and regulatory agency interactions. 
 Biotechnology Industry and Virtual Drug Company Growth 
 The U.S. biotechnology industry has grown rapidly over the last two decades and has emerged as a key client segment for the drug discovery and development services industry. In recent years, this industry has generated significant numbers of new drug candidates that will require development and regulatory approval. Many biotechnology drug developers do not have sufficient in-house resources to conduct early stage drug development. Many new companies choose only to carry a product to a development stage sufficient to attract a partner who will manufacture and market the drug. Because of the time and cost involved, these companies typically rely heavily on CROs to conduct research for their drug candidates. 
 Specialized Technical Expertise 
 The increasing complexity of new drug candidates requires highly specialized, innovative, solution-driven research not available in all client labs. We believe that this need for specialized technical expertise will increasingly lead to outsourcing of research activity. We believe further that the reliance of the pharmaceutical industry on small innovative drug discovery companies, which are often overlooked by large CROs, creates an opportunity for strategic partnership with small, consulting-based and innovative CROs such as ours. 
 Data Management and Quality Expertise 
 Our clients and worldwide regulatory authorities require more data, greater access to that data, consistent and auditable management of that data, and greater security and control of that data. We have made investments in software throughout our contract services groups to optimize efficiency and promote compliance with regulations and market expectations. 
 Globalization of the Marketplace 
 Foreign firms rely on independent development companies like ours with experience in the U.S. to provide integrated services through all phases of product development and to assist in preparing complex regulatory submissions. Domestic drug firms are broadening product availability globally, which increases demand for local regulatory approval. We believe that we and other domestic service providers with global reach, established regulatory expertise, and a broad range of integrated development services and products will benefit from this trend. 
 Our Solution 
 We address the needs of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, as well as academic, non-profit and government organizations, for drug discovery and development by providing integrated products and services to help our clients maximize the return on their research and development investments. We have focused on stabilizing critical supply chain 
 18 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 issues particularly related to research models. We believe our application of innovative technologies and products and our commitment to quality throughout the drug discovery and development process offer our clients a way to identify and develop successful drugs and devices more quickly and cost-effectively. We have obtained significant drug development expertise from almost 50 years of operation, and in recent years, we have added to our CRO service offerings through expansion of current facilities, acquisitions and startup initiatives to build new service offerings internally. 
 Product Liability and Insurance 
 We maintain product liability and professional errors and omissions liability insurance, providing coverage on a claims-made basis. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we seek to manage our liability risk through contractual provisions to be indemnified by the client or covered by the client s liability insurance policies. Also, in certain types of engagements, we seek to limit our contractual liability to clients to the amount of fees received. Our client contractual arrangements are subject to negotiation, and the terms and scope of indemnification, liability limitation and insurance coverage vary by client and project. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We believe that our patents, trademarks, copyrights and other proprietary rights are important to our business. Accordingly, we actively seek protection for those rights both in the United States and abroad. Where we deem it to be an appropriate course of action, we will vigorously prosecute patent infringements. 
 
 Our issued patents are protected for durations ranging from October of 2031 to February of 2034. We also hold various U.S. registered copyrights. In addition to these formal intellectual property rights, we rely on trade secrets, unpatented know-how and continuing applications research which we seek to protect through means of reasonable business procedures, such as confidentiality agreements. 
 
 Raw Materials 
 
 There are no specialized raw materials that are particularly essential to our business. We have a variety of alternative suppliers for the components in our diets and bedding products.

 ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS 
 Our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties, which may affect our future financial performance or condition. If any of the events or circumstances described below occur, our business and financial performance or condition could be adversely affected, our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline. The risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face. There may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material that may adversely affect our business and financial performance. 
 
 Risks Related to NHP Supply 
 
 Our business, results of operations, financial condition, including the carrying value of certain of our assets, and cash flows have and may continue to be adversely affected by our dependence on the importation of NHPs from suppliers located outside the U.S., particularly from communist countries in Southeast Asia, legal issues related to these suppliers, and any inability to diversify our suppliers located outside the U.S. 
 
 Our business, results of operations, financial condition, including the carrying value of certain of our assets, and cash flows have and may continue to be adversely affected by our dependence on NHP suppliers that are located outside the U.S. and difficulties in being able to diversify our suppliers located outside the U.S. China exited the NHP exportation market in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, and has repeatedly stated that it strategically intends to dominate, amongst other things, worldwide biomedical research. As such, their demand for NHPs has shifted a previously exported supply to their domestic use. Legal matters affecting the Cambodian supply of NHPs , including those arising as a result of the USAO-SDFL criminally charging employees of our principal supplier of NHPs, along with two Cambodian government officials has further exacerbated an already constrained NHP supply for U.S. research. The Company understands that one of the Cambodian government officials is currently scheduled to be tried by the USAO-SDFL in March 2024. The a llegations contained in that indictment also led us to refrain from selling or delivering any of the Cambodian NHPs we held in the U.S. until we could evaluate what additionally could be done to confirm that the NHPs in inventory from Cambodia could be reasonably determined to be purpose-bred. The decision to refrain from selling or delivering the Cambodian NHPs had a material adverse effect on our liquidity. In order to address the material adverse effect, we entered into an amendment to our credit facility. 
 
 While we are seeking to diversify our suppliers located outside the U.S., the number of NHP suppliers is limited, and we may not be successful in doing so. If we are unable to obtain NHPs in sufficient quantities of the required species or in a timely manner to meet the needs of our clients, if the price of NHPs that are available increases significantly, or if we are unable to ship the NHPs in our possession to our clients because of governmental restrictions or limitations, our business, particularly in our RMS segment, will be materially adversely affected. 
 
 In addition, overall supply constraints with respect to NHPs has led to an extremely dynamic pricing environment for NHPs, which has, and could continue to, make it difficult to predict results, lead to reduced volumes, and require us to adjust operations. Further, during fiscal 2023, the volume of NHPs we sold to third parties was significantly lower than in fiscal 2022. 
 
 Risks Related to Regulation and Legal Matters 
 
 We are involved in legal proceedings that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 We are involved in legal proceedings related to various matters, including employment and securities litigation, and may become involved in other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the future. For example, as discussed further in Note 16 - Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8, a putative securities class action and derivative securities lawsuits have been filed against the Company and certain officers and directors, alleging violations of the Exchange Act related to the Company s disclosures concerning its acquisitions of Envigo and OBRC and their regulatory compliance. 
 
 Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, can be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, be harmful to our reputation, require significant management attention, and divert significant resources. In addition, the expense of litigation and the timing of this expense from period to period are difficult to estimate and subject to change. Litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view of these matters may change in the future. Given the uncertain nature of legal proceedings generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or 
 22 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. We could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period. 
 
 We are subject to inspections, investigations and enforcement actions by regulatory authorities, which could lead to penalties, including substantial fines, warning letters, a temporary restraining order or injunction, civil and/or criminal penalties, and/or license suspension or revocation. 
 
 We are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities, including the FDA, the USDA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. As part of these inspections, the regulatory authorities seek to determine whether our facilities, operations and animal research model importation practices comply with applicable laws and regulations. Adverse findings as a result of these inspections could lead to enforcement actions, including substantial fines, warning letters that require corrective action (including potential facilities improvement requirements), revocation of approvals, exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs, criminal prosecution and even the denial of the right to conduct business. Envigo s Cumberland, VA facility, which was closed as of September 30, 2022, had been the subject of inspections by the USDA, a search and seizure warrant executed by the U.S. Department of Justice (the DOJ and federal and state law enforcement agents. Further, certain employees also received a grand jury subpoena requested by the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Western District of Virginia, and the Company has received additional subpoenas related to this matter. For further information on these and other actions, see Note 16 - Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8. 
 
 Inspections, investigations and/or other actions could result in penalties that could include a temporary restraining order or injunction, civil and/or criminal penalties, and/or license suspension or revocation. The imposition of any of these penalties or other restrictions on our business could adversely affect our business reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and stock price. 
 
 We are subject to environmental, health and safety requirements and risks as a result of which we may incur significant costs, liabilities and obligations. 
 
 We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws, regulations, initiatives and permits that govern, among other things: the emission and discharge of materials, including greenhouse gases, in air, land and water; the remediation of soil, surface water and groundwater contamination; the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal and transportation of regulated materials and wastes, including biomedical and radioactive wastes; and health and safety. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations or permits could result in fines or sanctions, obligations to investigate or remediate existing or potential contamination, third-party property damage claims, personal injury claims, natural resource damages claims or modification or revocation of operating permits and may lead to temporary or permanent business interruptions. Pursuant to certain environmental laws, we may be held strictly, and under certain circumstances jointly and severally, liable for costs of investigation and remediation of contaminated sites which we currently own or operate, or sites we or our predecessors have owned or operated in the past. Further, we could be held liable at sites where we have sent waste for disposal. 
 
 Environmental laws, regulations and permits, and the enforcement thereof, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Compliance with the requirements of laws and regulations may increase capital costs and operating expenses or necessitate changes to our production processes. 
 
 We use, and in the past have used, hazardous materials and generate, and in the past have generated, hazardous wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages and incur liabilities which could exceed our resources. Our costs, liabilities and obligations relating to environmental matters may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Any failure by us to comply with existing regulations could harm our reputation and operating results, and requirements to comply with new laws, regulations and guidance may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Any failure on our part to comply with existing regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities. For example, if we were to fail to properly monitor compliance with study protocols, the data collected could be disqualified. Under such circumstances, we may be contractually required to repeat a study at no further cost to the client, but at substantial cost to us. That development 
 23 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 would harm our reputation, our prospects for future work and our operating results. The issuance of a notice from the FDA or the USDA, or other relevant authorities, based on a finding of a material violation by us of good clinical practice, good laboratory practice or good manufacturing practice requirements, animal welfare laws and regulations, or other applicable regulations could materially and adversely affect our business and financial performance. Furthermore, the cost to comply with new federal or state legislature may adversely affect our operating results. 
 
 Changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical industry could change the demand for the services we provide. 
 
 Governmental agencies throughout the world, but particularly in the United States, strictly regulate the drug development process. Our business involves helping pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies comply with the regulatory drug approval process. Changes in regulation, such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures, or an increase in regulatory requirements that we may have difficulty satisfying, or that make our services less competitive, could substantially change the demand for our services and products. Also, if governments increase efforts to contain drug costs and pharmaceutical and biotechnology company profits from new drugs, or if governments impose new regulatory requirements demanding restricted use of research models for biomedical research, our clients may spend less, or slow the pace of increased spending, on research and development. 
 
 If we fail to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 
 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regulations under the HIPAA demand compliance with patient privacy and confidentiality requirements. We are also subject to federal, state and international data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, location, disposal and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition to U.S. federal laws and regulations, a number of U.S. states have also enacted data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, disposal, and protection of personal information. The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving as countries continue to adopt privacy and data security laws that may apply to us, both because our operations are located in those countries and/or because we provide services to customers in those countries. The interpretation and enforcement of the laws and regulations described above are uncertain and subject to change, and may require substantial costs to monitor and implement compliance with any additional requirements. Failure to comply with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations, and the disclosure of any data or related breach, could result in government enforcement actions (which could include substantial civil and/or criminal penalties and injunctive relief), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Risks Related to our Financial Activities 
 We have experienced periods of losses and financial insecurity. 
 Throughout our history we have experienced periods of financial losses and financial hardship. Our current efforts may not result in profitability, or if our efforts result in profits, such profits may not continue for any meaningful period of time. In order to finance various acquisitions and expand certain facilities, we have significantly increased our leverage. Sustained losses may result in our inability to service our financial obligations as they come due, including the additional indebtedness we have incurred to support our growth initiatives, or to meaningfully invest in our business. 
 We have incurred significant additional indebtedness during recent periods, which may impair our ability to raise further capital or impact our ability to service our debt. 
 We have incurred significant additional indebtedness during recent periods. Our additional indebtedness may impair our ability to raise further capital, including to expand our business, pursue strategic investments, and take advantage of financing or other opportunities that we believe to be in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders. 
 Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and 
 24 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, curtailing spend, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Our additional indebtedness may also impact our ability to service our debt and to comply with financial covenants and the other terms of our relevant credit arrangements, in which case our lenders might pursue available remedies up to and including terminating our credit arrangements and foreclosing on available collateral. 
 Our credit agreement contains covenants that restrict our business and financing activities. All of our assets secure our obligations under the credit agreement and may be subject to foreclosure. 
 We are party to a Credit Agreement with Jefferies Finance LLC, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto (as amended, the Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement contains various covenants, restrictions, and events of default. Among other things, these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios, including a secured leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio, and impose certain limits on our ability to engage in certain activities. The Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement that we entered into on January 9, 2023, imposes additional limitations on us through the date that we deliver financial statements for the quarter ending March 31, 2024, including restrictions on permitted asset sales, a prohibition on making permitted acquisitions, and significant limitations on the ability to incur additional debt, make investments and make restricted payments. Further during that time, we can only use borrowings under the revolving credit facility to fund operational expenses in the ordinary course. 
 The restrictions in the Credit Agreement, including under the Third Amendment, impose operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to compete effectively, take advantage of new business opportunities, or take other actions that may be in our, or our shareholders , best interests. Further, various risks and uncertainties, including those arising as a result of the USAO-SDFL criminally charging employees of the Company s principal supplier of NHPs, along with two Cambodian government officials, may impact our ability to comply with our obligations under the Credit Agreement. 
 
 Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by all assets (other than certain excluded assets) of the Company and each of the subsidiary guarantors. 
 
 Our inability to comply with any of the provisions of the Credit Agreement could result in a default under it. If such a default occurs, the lenders may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable, and they would have the right to terminate any commitments to provide further funds. If we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lenders also have the right to proceed against the collateral. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 
 
 Our failure to comply with the terms of our Credit Agreement could result in an event of default that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 If there were an event of default under our Credit Agreement, all amounts outstanding under that agreement could be due and payable immediately, which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. An event of default may occur should our assets or cash flow be insufficient to fully repay borrowings under our Credit Agreement, whether paid in the ordinary course or accelerated, or if we are unable to maintain compliance with relevant obligations thereunder, including financial and other covenants. Various risks and uncertainties, including those arising as a result of the USAO-SDFL criminally charging employees of the principal supplier of non-human primates to the Company, along with two Cambodian government officials, may impact our ability to comply with our obligations under the Credit Agreement. 
 
 Our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 due to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to remediate these material weaknesses and maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately 
 25 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and materially and adversely affect our business and financial results. 
 
 Our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2023 and 2022: 
 
 Management did not design and maintain effective controls over information technology general controls (ITGCs) for all applications that are relevant to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements throughout the year ended September 30, 2022, which resulted in ineffective business process controls (automated and IT-dependent manual controls) that could result in misstatements potentially impacting all of the financial statement accounts and disclosures. Specifically, management did not design and maintain: sufficient user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and adequately restrict user and privileged access to financial applications, programs and data to appropriate Company personnel; and program change management controls to ensure that information technology IT program and data changes affecting financial information technology applications and underlying accounting records are authorized, tested, and implemented appropriately. As a result, business process controls (automated and IT-dependent manual controls) that are dependent on the ineffective ITGCs, or that use data produced from systems impacted by the ineffective ITGCs were deemed ineffective at September 30, 2022, and were not remediated and therefore remained ineffective at September 30, 2023; and 
 
 Management did not have an adequate process in place to design and test the operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner or an adequate process in place to monitor and provide oversight over the completion of its assessment of internal control over financial reporting. As such, we determined that management did not effectively design and implement components of the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (COSO framework) to address all relevant risks of material misstatement, including elements of the control environment, information and communication, control activities and monitoring activities components, relating to: (i) providing sufficient and timely management oversight and ownership over the internal control evaluation process; (ii) hiring and training sufficient personnel to timely support the Company s internal control objectives; and (iii) performing timely monitoring and oversight to ascertain whether the components of internal control are present and functioning effectively. As a result, controls relevant to all business processes and related controls (including relevant entity level controls) were deemed ineffective at September 30, 2022, and were not remediated and therefore remained ineffective at September 30, 2023. 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. We expect to take steps to remediate the material weaknesses, but there is no assurance that any remediation efforts will ultimately have the intended effects. 
 
 If we identify any new material weaknesses in the future, any such newly identified material weakness could limit our ability to prevent or detect a misstatement of our accounts or disclosures that could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements. In such case, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and our stock price may decline as a result. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or any measures we may take in the future, will be sufficient to avoid potential future material weaknesses. 
 
 Risks Related to our Operations 
 
 We rely on a limited number of key clients, the importance of which may vary dramatically from year to year, and a loss of one or more of these key clients may adversely affect our operating results. 
 One client related to the RMS segment accounted for approximately 22.0 and 28.2 of our total revenue during fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Five clients of the DSA segment in the aggregate accounted for approximately 5.4 and 7.2 of our total revenue during fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. The loss of a significant amount of business from one or more of our major clients would materially and adversely affect our results of operations until such time, if ever, as we are able to replace the lost business. Significant clients or projects in any 
 26 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 one period may not continue to be significant clients or projects in other periods. In any given year, there is a possibility that a single client may account for a significant percentage of our total revenue or that our business may depend on one or more large projects. Since we do not have long-term contracts with most of our clients, the importance of a single client may vary dramatically from year to year as projects end and new projects begin. To the extent that we are meaningfully dependent on any single client, we are indirectly subject to risks related to that client, including if such risks impede the client s ability to stay in business or otherwise to make timely payments to us. 
 We operate in a highly competitive industry. 
 The CRO services industry is highly competitive. We often compete for business not only with other CROs, but also with internal discovery and development departments within our client companies. Several of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing, technical or other resources and a larger global footprint than we have. The industry has historically been diverse with more than 1,000 CROs around the globe, ranging from small, regional niche laboratories up to global comprehensive service providers with tens of thousands of employees. 
 The CRO industry has experienced consolidation in recent years. This trend is likely to produce more competition among the larger companies for both clients and acquisition candidates. Offshore CROs have provided increasing competitive pressures. 
 The RMS industry is highly competitive. Competition ranges from academics and large biopharmaceutical companies, that derive and maintain their own rodent colonies, to commercial competitors that may offer a similar or overlapping range of products and/or services. Some of these competitors have greater capital, technical and other resources than we have, while other competitors that are smaller specialized companies might compete effectively against us based on price and their concentrated size and focus. 
 If we do not compete successfully, our business will suffer. Increased competition might lead to price and other concessions that could adversely affect our operating results. 
 The majority of our clients contracts and orders can be terminated upon short notice. 
 Most of our contracts for CRO services are terminable by the client upon 30 days notice and these clients terminate or delay their contracts for a variety of reasons. Further, in general, our clients order research models on an as-needed basis. The size and frequency of those orders can be reduced or eliminated with little or no notice. 
 Client contracts and orders may be negatively impacted for various reasons, including: 
 products being tested fail to satisfy safety requirements; 
 products having undesired clinical results; 
 the client deciding to forego a particular study; 
 inability to enroll enough patients in the study; 
 inability to recruit enough investigators; 
 loss of funding for the particular research study or program; 
 production problems causing shortages of the drug; 
 inability to secure research models relevant to the studies; and 
 actions by regulatory authorities. 
 Although our CRO contracts frequently entitle us to receive the costs of winding down the terminated projects, as well as all fees earned by us up to the time of termination, and some of our contracts entitle us to a termination fee, the loss, reduction in scope or delay of a large contract or order, or the loss or delay of multiple contracts or orders, could materially adversely affect our business. 
 27 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 We may bear financial risk if we underprice our contracts or overrun cost estimates. 
 Since some of our contracts are structured as fixed price or fee-for-service, we bear the financial risk if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates. Significant underpricing or cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 
 Our business uses biological and hazardous materials, which could injure people or violate laws, resulting in liability that could adversely impact our financial condition and business. 
 Our activities involve the controlled use of potentially harmful biological materials, as well as hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages that result, and any liability could exceed our insurance coverage and ability to pay. Any contamination or injury could also damage our reputation, which is critical to obtaining new business. In addition, we are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations is significant and if changes are made to impose additional requirements, these costs could increase and have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our animal populations may suffer diseases that can damage our inventory, harm our reputation, result in decreased sales of our services or research products or result in other liability. 
 It is important that our animal populations be free of diseases, including infectious diseases. The presence and prevalence of diseases can distort or compromise the quality of research results, can cause substantial loss of animals in our inventory, can result in harm to humans or outside animal populations if the disease is not contained to animals in inventory, or can result in other losses. 
 These risks may differ substantially according to species. In rodents, most infections are without any apparent clinical signs and therefore pose a risk to the scientific quality of the research performed on the animals rather than to humans. The same applies to primates, where all animals are serologically tested for specific diseases in our facilities and at our suppliers. The main concern in this species is the potential for zoonotic infectious disease-causing harm to humans. We seek to minimize the risk of these species being infected by stringent biohazard management protocols and health monitoring programs in place in our facilities. Nevertheless, we have in the past suffered disease in our animal populations and may suffer outbreaks in the future. 
 If disease or contamination occurs in our animal population, it typically requires remediation and cleanup activities that are costly and time consuming. In certain circumstances, it can require the temporary or permanent closure of an affected facility. We have experienced such closures in the past and may do so again in the future. 
 Any significant disease outbreak has the potential to harm our reputation or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. There is also the risk that disease from research models we produce may affect our clients facilities and may result in an affected client requesting compensation for damages. 
 While we endeavor to include provisions in our sale and supply contracts which entitle us to be indemnified or entitle us to a limitation of liability, these provisions do not uniformly protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions, such as negligence or misconduct. Moreover, in certain circumstances, we may agree to use contracts drafted by our clients, which may not contain clauses that indemnify us or limit our liability. We could be materially adversely affected if we were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim which is not covered by a contractual indemnification provision or in the event that a party who must indemnify us does not fulfill its indemnification obligations or which is beyond the level of our insurance coverage or for which insurance coverage is not available. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain insurance coverage on terms acceptable to us. 
 Failure to manage our growth effectively could cause our business to suffer and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 We experienced significant growth in a short period of time, including as a result of the Envigo acquisition. To manage our growth effectively, we must continually evaluate and evolve our organization. We must also manage our employees, operations, finances, technology and development and capital investments efficiently. Our efficiency, 
 28 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 productivity and the quality of our products and services may be adversely impacted if we do not integrate and manage our growth effectively, or if we fail to appropriately coordinate across our organization. 
 Additionally, our rapid growth may place a strain on our resources, infrastructure and ability to maintain the quality of our products and services. You should not consider our revenue growth and levels of profitability in recent periods as indicative of future performance. In future periods, our revenue or profitability could decline or grow more slowly than we expect. Failure to manage our growth effectively could cause our business to suffer and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. 
 Providing CRO services creates a risk of liability. 
 We could be held liable for errors and omissions in connection with the services we perform. In certain circumstances, we seek to manage our liability risk through contractual provisions with clients requiring indemnification by the clients or coverage under the clients product liability insurance policies. The financial performance of our client indemnifying parties is not secured. Therefore, we bear the risk that the indemnifying party may not have the financial ability, or may otherwise fail, to fulfill its indemnification obligations or that the liability could exceed the amount of applicable client insurance, if any. In the event that we are unable to reach indemnification or insurance coverage arrangements with our clients to appropriately cover our potential losses, our insurance coverage may not adequately cover such losses. Relevant insurance coverage may also not always be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. 
 New technologies may be developed, validated and increasingly used in biomedical research that could reduce demand for some of our products and services. 
 For many years, groups within the scientific and research communities have attempted to develop models, methods and systems that would replace or supplement the use of living animals as test subjects in biomedical research. In addition, technological improvements to existing or new processes, such as imaging and biomarker technology, could result in a refinement in the number of animal research models necessary to conduct the required research. Alternative research methods could decrease the need for research models, and we may not be able to develop new products effectively or in a timely manner to replace any lost sales. In addition, other companies or entities may develop research models with characteristics different than the ones that we produce, and which may be viewed as more desirable by our clients. 
 Our non-U.S. locations account for a significant percentage of our revenues, exposing us to risks associated with operating internationally. 
 During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, 15.7 and 13.8 , respectively, of our revenues were generated by our facilities outside the U.S. As a result of these sales from foreign entities and facilities located outside the U.S., our operations are subject to a variety of risks unique to international operations, including the following: 
 exposure to local economic conditions; 
 currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations; 
 differences and changes in tax laws; 
 potential restrictions on the transfer of funds; 
 differences in regulatory requirements; 
 exposure to liabilities under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or the U.K. Antibribery Act; 
 government imposed investment and other restrictions or requirements; 
 failure to comply with new and evolving regulations, including privacy and security laws 
 exposure to local social unrest, including any resulting acts of war, terrorism or similar events; 
 exposure to local public health issues and the resulting impact on economic and political conditions; 
 difficulty enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain legal systems; 
 more expansive legal rights of employees, including specifically those applicable to our European operations; 
 variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights; and 
 29 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 export and import and trade restrictions (such as antidumping duties, tariffs or embargoes). 
 Some of our clients and contracts depend on government funding of research and development and a reduction in that funding may adversely affect our business. 
 A significant portion of sales are derived from clients at academic institutions and research laboratories whose funding is partially dependent on funding from government sources, including the NIH and U.K./E.U. equivalents. Such funding can be difficult to forecast as it may be subject to the political process. Our sales may be adversely affected if our clients delay purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government budget proposals. There can be no certainty that government research funding that is approved will be directed towards projects and studies that require use of our products and services. A reduction in government funding for the NIH or other government research agencies could adversely affect our business and our financial results. 
 Risks Related to our Acquisition and Optimization Activities 
 We have and may further expand our business through acquisitions, which exposes us to various risks. Our due diligence of our past or future acquisitions may not have identified all pertinent risks, or the full magnitude of such risks, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. 
 We have completed several acquisitions and from time to time review other acquisition candidates. Factors which may affect our ability to effectively pursue acquisition targets or to grow successfully through completed acquisitions, including our recent acquisitions, include: 
 The inability of the Company to obtain financing for the acquisition of targets; 
 Difficulties and expenses in connection with integrating acquired companies and achieving expected benefits, including as related to the integration of departments, accounting and other systems, technologies, books and records and procedures; 
 Diversion of management s attention from daily operations to various integration activities; 
 The potential for disruption of prior operations and plans; 
 The risk that acquisitions could be dilutive to earnings, or in the event of acquisitions made through the issuance of our common shares to the shareholders of the acquired company, dilutive to the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders; 
 The possibility that we may be adversely affected by risks facing the acquired companies, including potential losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of acquired companies not covered by the indemnification we may obtain from the sellers; 
 Risks associated with the assimilation and retention of employees, including key employees; 
 The potential loss of, or adverse effects on, existing business relationships the acquired business has with suppliers and clients; 
 The potential need to address relevant internal control over financial reporting and disclosure control and procedures matters; 
 Possible deficiencies in operational processes and procedures; 
 Risks associated with carrying a relatively significant level of debt; and 
 The ability of our management team to manage expanded operations to meet operational and financial expectations. 
 
 Our operating results or financial condition also may be adversely impacted by (i) claims or liabilities related to the acquired companies businesses including, among others, claims from U.S. regulatory or other governmental agencies, such as those related to OBRC and Envigo, terminated employees, current or former clients or business partners, or other third parties; (ii) pre-existing contractual relationships of the acquired companies that we would not have otherwise entered into, the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business; (iii) unfavorable accounting treatment as a result of the acquired companies' practices; and (iv) intellectual property claims or disputes. 
 
 30 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 Certain of the companies we have acquired were not required to maintain an internal control infrastructure that would meet the standards of a public company, including the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and we may acquire similar companies in the future. The costs to implement such controls and procedures may be substantial and we could encounter unexpected delays and challenges in this implementation. In addition, we may discover significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the quality of an acquired company's financial and disclosure controls and procedures which could result in additional costs or adversely affect our business or operating results, and, as has occurred with us, the accounting for acquisitions can be complex and may lead to material weaknesses. 
 
 As part of our merger and acquisition due diligence, we utilize information provided by relevant sellers. As is true with any merger and acquisition transaction, we may not be aware of all liabilities, or the full magnitude of liabilities, of the acquired business at the time of acquisition. Potential incremental liabilities and additional risks and uncertainties related to our recent or future acquisitions not known or fully appreciated by us could negatively and materially impact our future business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, there are a number of investigations, lawsuits, claims and other matters described in Note 16 Contingencies that relate to the businesses and operations we acquired through the acquisitions of Envigo, OBRC and others . 
 We may need additional capital, and any additional capital we seek may not be available in the amount or at the time we need it. 
 Successful execution of our growth plans will require that we have access to capital. Our expected financing needs are based upon management s estimates as to future revenue and expense. Our business plan and financing needs are subject to change based upon, among other factors, our ability to increase revenues and manage expenses and the timing and extent of our future capital expenditures and acquisition activity. If our estimates of our financing needs change, we may need additional capital more quickly than we expect or we may need a greater amount of capital. 
 In general, additional capital may be raised through the sale of common shares, preferred equity or convertible debt securities, entry into debt facilities or other third-party funding arrangements. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our shareholders and those securities may have rights senior to those of our common shares. Agreements entered into in connection with such capital raising activities could contain covenants that would restrict our operations or require us to relinquish certain rights. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot timely raise any needed funds, we may be forced to reduce our operating expenses, which could adversely affect our ability to implement our long-term strategic roadmap and grow our business. 
 The Company may fail to realize anticipated strategic and financial benefits from acquisitions, related integrations and our site optimization strategy. 
 We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our business acquisitions. These acquisitions may not further our business strategy as we expect, we may fail to successfully integrate the acquired operations as planned or to realize the synergies and other benefits we expected from the acquisitions, we may experience unexpected adverse impacts on the acquired businesses, or we may otherwise not realize the expected return on our investments, any of which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially cause impairment to assets that we record as a part of the acquisitions, including intangible assets and goodwill. We may have difficulties managing the acquired businesses or retaining key personnel of the acquired companies. 
 In addition, during recent periods, we have undertaken restructuring and site optimization initiatives, designed to allow us to reduce overhead and create efficiencies through scale. We are also currently working to take in-house the North American transportation services previously provided by a third party. These initiatives present significant risks that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating enhancements and/or cost reductions, or otherwise harm our business, including higher than anticipated costs in implementing these initiatives, asset impairments and management distraction. If we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of these initiatives, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Risks Related to the Industries we Serve 
 We are substantially dependent on the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. 
 Our revenues depend greatly on the expenditures made by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in research and development, including their decisions to outsource drug development services to providers like us, rather than 
 31 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 handling such services in-house. In some instances, companies in these industries are reliant on their ability to raise capital in order to fund their research and development projects and to compensate us for services rendered. 
 Fluctuations in the research and development budgets of researchers and their organizations has, had and could continue to have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. Research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, spending priorities and institutional budgetary policies, among other reasons. Accordingly, economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries also affect our business. Our ability to continue to grow and win new business depends in large part upon the ability and willingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on research and development and to purchase the products and outsource the services we provide. If companies in these industries were to reduce the number or scope of research and development projects they conduct or outsource, our business could be materially adversely affected. We believe this occurred to some extent is fiscal year 2023 and could continue. 
 Risks Related to Research and Development 
 Our future success depends on our ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes that could make our services and products less competitive or obsolete. 
 The biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device industries generally, and contract research services more specifically, are subject to increasingly rapid technological changes. Our competitors or others might develop technologies, services or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future technologies, services or products, or that render our technologies, services or products less competitive or obsolete. If competitors introduce superior technologies, services or products and we cannot make enhancements to our counterparts to remain competitive, our competitive position, and in turn our business, revenues and financial condition, would be materially and adversely affected. Many of our competitors have superior financial and human resources deployed toward research and development efforts. Our relatively constrained financial and human resources may limit our ability to effectively keep pace with relevant technological changes. 
 Actions of animal rights activists may affect our business. 
 Products and services of the type we provide are required for the registration of pharmaceutical products under regulatory auspices in the United States, Europe and other countries. Many CROs, animal breeders, biopharmaceutical companies and other research organizations have been targeted by animal rights activists that oppose all testing on animals, for whatever purpose, including the animal testing activities in support of safety and efficacy testing for drug development. These groups, which include groups directed at the industry and us, have publicly stated that the goal of their campaign is to stop animal testing. Acts of vandalism and other acts by animal rights activists who object to the use of animals in product development could have a material adverse effect on our business. These groups have historically targeted CROs, animal breeders, academic institutions and biopharmaceutical companies, but also third parties that do business with those organizations, including clients, suppliers, advisors, financial advisors, lenders and investors. 
 Risks Related to Technology and Cybersecurity 
 We are at risk of cyber-attacks or other security breaches that could compromise sensitive business information, undermine our ability to operate effectively and expose us to liability, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer. 
 Cyber-attacks or security breaches could compromise confidential information of ours, our employees and our clients, cause a disruption in our operations, harm our reputation and expose us to liability, which in turn could negatively impact our business and the value of our common shares. As a routine element of our business, we collect, analyze, and retain substantial amounts of data pertaining to the clinical and non-clinical studies we conduct for our clients. We also maintain other sensitive client information, information regarding intellectual property related to certain of our products and other business-critical information, including personally identifiable information of our employees. Our employees, some of whom have access to such information, have and will likely continue to receive phishing e-mails intended to trick recipients into surrendering their usernames and passwords and/or inadvertently installing malicious software onto their computers or networks they are connected to. We cannot completely protect against the 
 32 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 possibility that sensitive information may be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen, via phishing attempts or other circumstances. 
 We utilize cybersecurity technologies, processes and practices which are designed to protect our networks, computers, programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access, but they may not be effective or work as designed. Our contracts with our clients typically contain provisions that require us to keep confidential the information generated from our studies. A cyber-attack could result in a breach of those provisions or other negative outcomes, including legal claims or proceedings, investigations, potential liabilities under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, delays and other impediments to our clients discovery and development efforts, ransomware demands and related delays, damage to our reputation and a negative impact on our financial results and the value of our common shares. 
 Hardware or software failures, delays in the operations of our computer and communications systems or the failure to implement system enhancements could harm our business. 
 We operate large and complex computer systems that contain significant amounts of client data. Our success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems. A failure of our network or data gathering procedures could impede the processing of data, delivery of databases and services, client orders, product shipments and day-to-day management of our business and could result in the corruption or loss of data. While we have disaster recovery plans in place for our operations, they might not adequately protect us. Damage from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins and similar events at our facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to our servers and from our servers to our clients. In addition, any failure by our computer environment to provide our required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our service. In the event of a delay in the delivery of data, we could be required to transfer our data collection operations to an alternative provider of server hosting services, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or on a timely basis, and could result in delays in our ability to deliver our products and services to our clients. Additionally, significant delays in the planned delivery of system enhancements, improvements and inadequate performance of the systems once they are completed could harm our business. Finally, long-term disruptions in our computer and communications infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters, the outbreak of war, the escalation of hostilities and acts of terrorism, particularly involving cities in which we have offices, could adversely affect our businesses. Our property and business interruption insurance coverage might not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur. 
 Risks Related to Health Emergencies 
 Our business, results of operations, financial condition, including the carrying value of certain of our assets, cash flows and stock price have and may continue to be adversely affected by pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies. 
 Our business, results of operations, financial condition, including the carrying value of certain of our assets, cash flows and stock price have and may continue to be adversely affected by pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies. Such health emergencies can result in governments around the world implementing stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, shelter in place and stay at home orders, travel restrictions, business curtailments, school closures, and other measures. 
 The outbreak of public health emergencies and preventive or protective actions taken by governmental authorities may continue to have a material adverse effect on our and our clients and suppliers respective operations, including with respect to the potential for business shutdowns or disruptions. The extent to which these health emergencies may continue to adversely impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, depending upon the severity and duration of the emergency and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain or mitigate its effects. Future financial impact cannot be estimated reasonably at this time, but may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, including the carrying value of certain of our assets, and cash flows. Even after public health emergencies have subsided, we may experience materially adverse impacts to our business due to any resulting economic recession or depression and demand for our products and services. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of public health emergencies have caused extreme volatility in financial and other capital markets which has and may in the future adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capital markets including to refinance existing obligations. To the extent public health 
 33 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 emergencies adversely affect our business and financial results, they may also have the effect of exacerbating many of the other risks described herein or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial. 
 Risks Related to Share Ownership 
 Our share price could continue to be volatile and our trading volume may fluctuate substantially. 
 The market price of our common shares has historically been and might continue to be volatile. Many factors may have a significant impact on the future price of our common shares, including: 
 our failure to successfully implement our business objectives; 
 our businesses, operations, results and prospects; 
 changes in revenue or earnings estimates, or changes in recommendations by equity research analysts; 
 compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements; 
 market acceptance of our products; 
 technological innovations, new commercial products or drug discovery efforts and preclinical and clinical activities by us or our competitors; 
 changes in government regulations, taxes, legal proceedings and other developments; 
 inspections, investigations and enforcement actions by regulatory authorities against us or our principal suppliers; 
 negative information related to, or adverse regulatory or other actions against us or our principal suppliers; 
 pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies, such as COVID-19; 
 general economic conditions, including changes in interest rates, and other external factors; 
 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results and those of our competitors; 
 announcements concerning us or our competitors; 
 market conditions in CRO or research model industries; 
 additions or departures of key management personnel; 
 future mergers and strategic alliances; 
 investor sentiment toward the stock of animal breeding companies; 
 maintenance of acceptable credit ratings or credit quality; 
 ability to fund future growth; 
 the degree of trading liquidity in our common shares; and 
 our ability to meet the minimum standards required for remaining listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. 
 Factors which may impact the price of our common shares include influences beyond our control, such as market conditions and changes in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries we serve. The stock market, and in particular the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnology company stocks, has experienced periods of significant price and volume fluctuations, including as a result of recent increases in interest rates and inflation. Volatility and valuation decline have affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies, often for reasons unrelated to their operating performance, and might adversely affect the price of our common shares. 
 Following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company s securities, securities class action litigation and derivative securities litigation have often been instituted against that company, as has been the case with us. Such occurrences of litigation could result in very substantial costs, divert management s attention and resources and harm our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 34 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 Our principal shareholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over matters subject to shareholder approval. 
 As of November 30, 2023, our executive officers, directors and 5 shareholders beneficially owned approximately 10.3 of our outstanding shares of capital stock. In addition, as of November 30, 2023, our executive officers and directors held options to purchase an aggregate of 360,908 of our common shares at a weighted-average exercise price of 6.38 per share and an aggregate of 723,515 unvested restricted stock units. Therefore, these shareholders will have the ability to influence us through this ownership position. The interests of this group of shareholders may not coincide with the interests of other shareholders. 
 The resale of certain shares issued in the Envigo acquisition and covered by a resale registration statement could adversely affect the market price of our common shares, which result could in turn negatively affect our ability to raise additional equity capital. 
 Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement which we entered with certain former shareholders of Envigo in connection with the Envigo acquisition, we filed a registration statement registering the resale of 6,964,728 of our common shares held by the shareholders who are parties to the Shareholders Agreement. The resale registration statement permits the resale of these shares at any time and without restriction. The sale, or availability for sale, of our common shares in the public market may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and may impair our ability to raise additional equity capital. The resale of a substantial number of our common shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price for our common shares and make it more difficult for you to sell our common shares at times and prices that you feel are appropriate. Furthermore, because there are a large number of shares registered pursuant to the resale registration statement, the selling shareholders named in such registration statement may continue to offer shares covered by the resale registration statement for a significant period of time, the precise duration of which cannot be predicted. Accordingly, the adverse market and price pressures resulting from an offering pursuant to the resale registration statement may continue for an extended period of time and continued negative pressure on the market price of our common shares could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional equity capital. 
 Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and under Indiana law may discourage or prevent a change in control, even if a sale of us would benefit our shareholders, which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by shareholders to replace or remove our current management. 
 Our Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Third Amended and Restated Bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control, discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common shares, harm the market price of our common shares, and diminish the voting and other rights of the holders of our common shares. These provisions include: 
 dividing our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms; 
 authorizing our board of directors to issue preferred stock and additional common shares without shareholder approval; 
 requiring one or more written demands signed and dated by holders of at least 25 of all the votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at a special meeting for shareholders to call a special meeting; 
 prohibiting our shareholders from amending our Bylaws; and 
 requiring advance notice for nominating directors at shareholders meetings. 
 Our board of directors also has the ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement, sometimes called a poison pill, providing for the issuance of a new series of preferred stock to holders of common shares. In the event of a takeover attempt, this preferred stock would give rights to holders of common shares (other than the potential acquirer) to buy additional common shares at a discount, leading to the dilution of the potential acquirer s stake. The board s ability to adopt a poison pill may discourage potential takeover offers, particularly by suitors the board may view as unfavorable transaction partners. 
 As an Indiana corporation, we are governed by the Indiana Business Corporation Law (as amended from time to time, the IBCL ). Under specified circumstances, certain provisions of the IBCL related to control share acquisitions, business combinations, and constituent interests may delay, prevent, or make more difficult unsolicited acquisitions or 
 35 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 changes of control. These provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish Company transactions that shareholders might deem to be in their best interest. 
 If we are unable to maintain listing of our securities on The Nasdaq Capital Market or another reputable stock exchange, it may be more difficult for our shareholders to sell their securities. 
 Nasdaq requires listed issuers to comply with certain standards in order to remain listed on its exchange. If, for any reason, Nasdaq should delist our securities from trading on its exchange and we are unable to obtain listing on another reputable national securities exchange, a reduction in some or all of the following may occur, each of which could materially adversely affect our shareholders: 
 the liquidity of our common shares; 
 the market price of our common shares; 
 our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations; 
 the number of institutional and general investors that will consider investing in our common shares; 
 the number of market makers in our common shares; 
 the availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of our common shares; and 
 the number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in our common shares. 
 General Risk Factors 
 The loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business. 
 Our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel. The loss of the services of such personnel could adversely affect our business. Also, because of the nature of our business, our success depends upon our ability to attract, train, manage and retain qualified personnel. There is substantial competition for qualified personnel, and an inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel may impact our ability to grow our business and compete effectively in our industry. 
 We rely on third parties for important services. 
 We have historically depended on third parties to provide us with services critical to our business, including without limitation transportation services. The failure of third parties to adequately provide needed services or our determination to forgo non-critical services, could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Unfavorable general economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business. 
 While it is difficult for us to predict the impact of general economic conditions on our business, these conditions could reduce client demand for some of our products or services, which could cause our revenue to decline. Also, our clients, particularly smaller biotechnology companies which are especially reliant on the credit and capital markets, may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit or equity funding, which could affect their ability to timely pay us. Moreover, we rely on credit facilities to provide working capital to support our operations and regularly evaluate alternative financing sources. Changes in the commercial credit market or in the financial stability of our creditors may impact the ability of our creditors to provide additional financing. In addition, the financial condition of our credit facility providers, which is beyond our control, may adversely change. Any decrease in our access to borrowings under our credit facility or successor facilities (if any), tightening of lending standards and other changes to our sources of liquidity could adversely impact our ability to obtain the financing we need to continue operating our business in the current manner. For these reasons, among others, if economic conditions stagnate or decline, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
 Global economic uncertainty has produced, and continues to produce, substantial stress, volatility, illiquidity and disruption of global credit and other financial markets. Various factors contribute to the uncertain economic environment, including geopolitical tensions, military conflicts, the level and volatility of interest rates, the level of 
 36 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 inflation, the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, an actual recession or fears of a recession, trade policies and tariffs, and political and governmental instability.

 Business Overview 
 Inotiv is a leading contract research organization ("CRO") dedicated to providing nonclinical and analytical drug discovery and development services to the pharmaceutical and medical device industries and selling a range of research-quality animals and diets to the same industries as well as academia and government clients. Our products and services enable the discovery and development of new drugs and medical devices and facilitate better understanding of disease biology, all while focusing on increasing efficiency, improving data and reducing the cost of discovering and taking new drugs and medical devices to market. Inotiv is committed to supporting discovery and development objectives as well as helping researchers realize the full potential of their critical research and development projects, all while working together to build a healthier and safer world. We are dedicated to practicing high standards of laboratory animal care and welfare. 
 During recent periods, we have undertaken significant internal and external growth initiatives, as well as site optimization initiatives. Our growth initiatives include acquisitions and related integrations, expansion of existing capacity and services, and startup of new services. Prior to fiscal year 2022, our growth initiatives focused on discovery and safety assessment services, and, as a result of our strategic acquisition of Envigo RMS Holding Corp. Envigo in November 2021, which added a complementary research model platform, our full spectrum solutions now span two segments: Discovery and Safety Assessment DSA and Research Models and Services RMS ). In addition to the growth initiatives described above, we have also undertaken site optimization initiatives through site closures and consolidation in the U.S. and Europe as further described below. 
 DSA 
 During the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, we continued building Inotiv into a comprehensive provider of preclinical drug discovery and safety assessment services through our strategic acquisitions of Plato BioPharma, Inc. Plato ), Integrated Laboratory Systems, LLC ILS ), Histion, LLC Histion ), Protypia, Inc. Protypia and our collaboration with Synexa Life Sciences. Plato brought us important new in vivo pharmacology capabilities, ILS complemented our BioReliance genetic toxicology assets and accelerated the buildout of our genetic toxicology offerings as well as expanded our general rodent toxicology capacity. In addition, ILS allowed us to provide a computational toxicology service to provide predictive toxicology assessments. Histion accelerated our development and growth into the highly-specialized plastics and medical device histopathology business and Protypia enhanced our ability to support clients in the development of safe and effective medicines, particularly in the areas of immuno-oncology and cell and gene therapy by bringing bioanalytical capability to solid tissue specimens. The partnership with Synexa Life Sciences enhanced our large molecule bioanalysis and biomarker platform. 
 
 During the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, our focus for our business within the DSA segment revolved around maximizing the integration of service offerings from the aforementioned acquisitions and continuing to build out additional service capabilities and capacity. As we completed fitting out laboratory space, validating new equipment and establishing our processes, we added to the overall depth and breadth of our services portfolio, and expanded our client service capabilities, which are designed to enhance both overall quality and operating margins by reducing our reliance on third-party outsourcing. These included our Boulder, Colorado, facility expansion, which was completed in December 2022, the opening of our Kalamazoo, Michigan, pathology site in January 2023, and the buildout of our Rockville, Maryland, site, which is now operational with GLP biotherapeutics analytical and genetic toxicology capabilities. Furthermore, the expansion activities at Fort Collins, Colorado, were completed by the end of October 2023 and the expanded site is completing the validation of the facility and equipment and plans to be operational early in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Additionally, we announced the expansion of our safety pharmacology offering with the validation and verification of a cardiopulmonary telemetry study model in cynomolgus macaques. Offered through our DSA business, telemetry

 allows for the continuous observation of ECG, respiratory rate and volume, blood pressure and other cardiovascular parameters during preclinical safety studies. Additional new service offerings that we are building internally include: mechanistic pharmacology and toxicology, safety pharmacology; juvenile toxicology; SEND (Standard for the Exchange of Nonclinical Data) data reporting; clinical pathology; biotherapeutics; histopathology for devices; genetic toxicology; and cardiovascular safety pharmacology. 
 RMS 
 During the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 and following the Envigo acquisition, we took steps to leverage our existing RMS capacity with the acquisition of Robinson Services Inc. s RSI rabbit breeding business and we acquired Orient BioResource Center, Inc. OBRC ), which provided access to additional non-human primate facilities. In addition to two sites that Envigo announced closing prior to our acquisition of Envigo, we announced in June 2022 that we were closing a purpose-bred canine facility in Cumberland, Virginia and a rodent breeding facility in Dublin, Virginia as part of restructuring activities. The rodent breeding operations were consolidated into an existing, recently renovated site . The Cumberland facility closure was completed in September 2022 and the Dublin facility closure was completed in November 2022. 
 During the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, our focus for our business within the RMS segment included navigating the global NHP market and executing on our site optimization plans. On November 16, 2022, the Company became aware that the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Southern District of Florida USAO-SDFL had criminally charged employees of the principal supplier of NHPs to the Company, along with two Cambodian government officials, with conspiring to illegally import NHPs into the U.S. from December 2017 through January 2022 and in connection with seven specific imports between July 2018 and December 2021, (the "November 16, 2022 event"). Also, as previously disclosed, two of the Company's subsidiaries, OBRC and Envigo, have received grand jury subpoenas from USAO-SDFL requiring the production of documents and information related to their importation of NHPs into the U.S. 
 The Company has not been directed to refrain from selling the Cambodian NHPs in its possessi on in the U.S. However, due to the allegations contained in the indictment involving the supplier and the Cambodian government officials, the Company believed that it was prudent, at the time of the November 16, 2022 event, to refrain from selling or delivering any of its Cambodian NHPs held in the U.S. until the Company s staff and external experts could evaluate what additionally could be done to satisfy itself that the NHPs in inventory from Cambodia can be reasonably determined to be purpose-bred. Historically, the Company relied on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora CITES documentation and related processes and procedures, including release of each import by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. After a thorough review of the documentation we have for the Cambodian NHPs in our inventory and their colonies, we resumed shipping a amount of Cambodian NHPs beginning in January 2023. In addition, we completed audits on site at our Cambodian supplier and we worked to establish even more robust procedures for future imports. 
 Since the November 16, 2022 event, we have focused on working with our suppliers and developing a long-term solution to establish procedures we can be comfortable assuring ourselves and our customers we only provide purpose-bred NHPs from Cambodia. We have scientists inside and outside our organization working towards establishing new testing procedures for importing purpose-bred Cambodian NHPs and meeting the needs of drug discovery and development in the US. In the meantime, we continued to import from countries outside of Cambodia to satisfy demand at our DSA business segment and to our RMS clients. During fiscal 2023, the volume of NHPs we sold to our RMS clients was significantly lower than in fiscal 2022. While the lower volume was offset by an increase in the average selling price of NHPs, the average selling price of NHPs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 was the lowest quarterly increase compared to each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2023. 
 
 During the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 , we announced additional site consolidation plans in the U.S. and our intent to consult with employee representatives for a proposed consolidation of certain European and U.K. sites. Our site optimization plans are intended to allow us to reduce overhead and create efficiencies through scale. During fiscal 2023 , we completed all planned fiscal year 2023 consolidations and closures and sold our Israeli businesses. The consolidation of the operations at our Blackthorn, U.K., facility with the operations in Hillcrest, U.K., is expected to be complete by the end of March 2024. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 , we made the decision to close our Spain facility. The exit of the Spain facility was complete as of September 30, 2023 and we sold the Spain facility in November 2023. Refer to Note 11 Restructuring and Assets Held for Sale to our consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 for more information related to the site consolidation plans.

 Over the last year, we have continued to improve our infrastructure and worked to optimize our operating platform to support future growth. These improvements included investments in our information technology platforms, building program management functions to enhance management and communication with clients and multi-site programs, further enhancing client services and improving the client experience. We believe the actions taken and investments made in recent periods form a solid foundation upon which we can continue to build.

 For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, DSA revenue was 185.1 million compared to 165.3 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, representing an increase of 19.8 million, or 12.0 . The increase in DSA revenue was primarily driven by additional revenue during the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, generated from Integrated Laboratory Systems that was acquired in January 2022, plus new services related to genetic toxicology and pricing increases in general toxicology services. These increases in DSA service revenue were partially offset by decreases in our discovery services revenue, primarily related to the decline in overall biotech funding in the market. 
 In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we continued to experience study cancellations in our DSA segment due primarily to certain compounds, not yet available for testing, and delayed studies as a result of our clients' re-prioritization of research and development spend and lack of funding. When contracts are terminated, we are generally able to recover, at a minimum, our invested costs. Despite an increased trend in cancellations over the past two years, our flexibility and expanded service offerings have enabled us to eventually replace most of the cancelled or postponed studies with studies from other clients. 
 
 DSA operating income decreased by 7.1 million, or 31.8 , driven by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense, an increase in bad debt expense, an increase in start-up costs primarily related to our Rockville facility, an increase in selling expenses in connection with increased revenues and an increase in compensation expense. These increases in DSA operating expenses were partially offset by the increased revenue discussed above. As we built up

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, RMS revenue was 387.3 million compared to 382.4 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, representing an increase of 4.9 million, or 1.3 . The increase in RMS revenue was due primarily to favorable pricing, particularly for NHPs, partially offset by the negative impact of lower volumes of NHP sales and lower sales of small animal models. Additionally, the increase in RMS revenue was impacted by the timing of contributions from acquisitions. Envigo was acquired on November 5, 2021, RSI was acquired on December 29, 2021, and OBRC was acquired on January 27, 2022. 
 RMS operating loss was 24.9 million in fiscal year 2023 compared to 189.3 million in fiscal year 2022 , a decrease of 164.4 million o r 86.8 , primarily driven by a 169.6 million decrease in non-cash goodwill impairment charges. In fiscal year 2022, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 236.0 million related to our RMS segment. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company determined that as a result of the November 16, 2022 event, the uncertainty related to the Company s ability to import NHPs from Cambodia, and the decrease in its stock price, the carrying value of its goodwill as of December 31, 2022, was required to be quantitatively evaluated. As a result of our impairment assessment for the first quarter in fiscal 2023 , we determined that the carrying amount of goodwill attributed to our RMS segment was in excess of its fair value, and therefore we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of 66.4 million within the RMS segment. 
 
 The decrease in RMS operating loss due to the increase in revenue and the decrease in the goodwill impairment charge amount was partially offset by a 5.5 million , or 20.8 , increase in operating expenses, which included an increase in selling expenses, primarily due to increased revenue, higher compensation expense and higher legal fees. 
 Unallocated Corporate

Tab l e o f Contents 

 Unallocated corporate costs consist of selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses that are not directly related or allocated to the reportable segments. The decrease in unallocated corporate costs to 71.8 million in fiscal 2023 , compared to 96.4 million in fiscal 2022, was primarily driven b y a decrease in stock compensation expense as a result of 23.0 million of post-combination, non-cash stock compensation expense relating to the adoption of the Envigo Equity Plan in fiscal 2022 and a decrease in acquisition expenses as a result of the timing of acquisition activity year-over-year. These decreases in unallocated corporate expenses were partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefits and legal and third party fees. 
 Other Expense 
 Other expense decreased by 46.2 million for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 . The decrease was primarily due to the loss of 56.7 million in fiscal year 2022 of fair value remeasurement of the embedded derivative component of the convertible notes issued in September 2021, which did not recur in fiscal 2023 . For additional information, see Capital Resources Convertible Senior Notes below. There was also an increase in interest expense of 13.3 million in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 , primarily due to the increased debt balance from the draw of our delayed draw term loan in October 2022 and an increase in interest rates year-over-year. 
 Income Taxes 
 Our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 were 15.6 and 4.3 , respectively. The benefit recorded for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 was 19.3 million and 15.2 million , respectively. The benefit from income taxes for fiscal year 2023 primarily related to deferred tax benefits on the pre-tax loss, partially offset by the impact on tax expense of certain non-deductible permanent book to tax differences related to goodwill impairment, withholding taxes paid in connection with the sale of the Israeli businesses, an increase in valuation allowances and other permanent items. The benefit from income taxes for fiscal year 2022 primarily related to deferred tax benefits on the pre-tax loss, offset primarily by the impact on tax expense of certain non-deductible permanent book to tax differences related to goodwill impairment, loss on fair value remeasurement of the embedded derivative component of the convertible notes, compensation, and other permanent items. 
 Consolidated Net Loss 
 As a result of the above described factors, we had a consolidated net loss of 104.9 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to a consolidated net loss of 337.3 million during the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2023 , the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 35.5 million compared to 18.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of September 30, 2022 , an increase of 17.0 million. 
 The November 16, 2022 event and our decision to refrain from selling or delivering Cambodian NHPs held in the U.S. at that time triggered a material adverse event clause in our Credit Agreement discussed in Note 7 - Debt to our consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8, resulting in, among other things, a limitation of our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility. The loss of access to our revolving credit facility and reduced liquidity resulting from the decision to refrain, at that time, from selling Cambodian NHPs held in the U.S. resulted in reduced forecasted liquidity. As a result of these events, we took steps to improve our liquidity, which included negotiating an amendment to our Credit Agreement, which was executed on January 9, 2023, to reinstate our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility. Without the amendment, we were at risk of not having the revolving credit facility available. 
 We have taken several additional steps designed to improve our liquidity, including our site optimization strategy which is intended to allow us to reduce overhead and create efficiencies through scale. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023 , we completed the closure of our Cumberland and Dublin, Virginia facilities. Also in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 , we announced additional site consolidation plans in the U.S. and our intent to consult with employee representatives for a proposed consolidation of certain European and U.K. sites. Prior to the acquisition of Envigo, the Boyertown, Pennsylvania and Haslett, Michigan facilities were identified for relocation of operations to the Denver, Pennsylvania facility. The exits of the Boyertown and Haslett facilities were completed in March 2023. We completed the sale of the Boyertown facility as of September 30, 2023 . During fiscal 2023 , we completed our consultation with employee representatives at the Gannat, France and Blackthorn, U.K. facilities, and the closures of both facilities were approved. The consolidation of operations at 
 44 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 Gannat with the operations in Horst, the Netherlands was completed in June 2023, and the consolidation of the operations at the Blackthorn facility with the operations in Hillcrest, U.K. is expected to be complete by the end of March 2024. The RMS St. Louis facility closed in June 2023 and the GEMS operations at the RMS St. Louis facility were relocated to the DSA St. Louis facility and other operational facilities. In July 2023, we made the decision to close our Spain facility and completed the exit of that facility prior to September 30, 2023 . Additionally, we completed the sale of our Spain facility in November 2023. 
 In connection with the site opti mizations noted above and other restructuring initiatives, we reduced our workforce. As of September 30, 2023, our headcount was approximately 7 lower than it was as of September 30, 2022 , . We also took steps to reduce our 2023 budgeted capital expenditures and certain forecasted expenses, including a reduction of nonessential travel and employee-related expenses among other efficiency-based reductions. Furthermore, we executed RMS price increases that began in January 2023. We also have identified and validated new NHP vendors outside of Cambodian to diversify our suppliers and increase our NHP supply. Additionally, we identified and executed new strategies to improve the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the transportation of our products. In December 2023, the Company announced that it will be partnering with Vanguard Supply Chain Solutions LLC, the Company s current provider of transportation services, to enable the in-house integration of Inotiv s North American transportation operations. By taking direct control of its transportation operations, the Company expects to achieve key efficiencies to strengthen internal operations, improve its outgoing supply chain, and bolster service and scientific continuity for clients. 
 These targeted initiatives implemented by the Company contributed to cash provided by operations of 27.9 million in fiscal 2023 compared to cash used in operations of 5.2 million in fiscal 2022. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2023 also included a decrease in working capital, more specifically a decrease in inventories and prepaid deposits, as well as a decrease in accounts receivable. These decreases in inventories and prepaid expenses were driven by the timing of prepaid deposits for future NHP shipments, the shipment of NHPs and the collection of cash as it relates to the shipments to clients. The decrease in accounts receivable was due to focused collection efforts executed during the fiscal year, as well as timing of invoicing and cash receipts. Partially offsetting these working capital changes were decreases in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities and fees invoiced in advance. 
 The Company believes its existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund its operations, satisfy its obligations, including cash outflows for planned targeted capital expenditures, and comply with minimum liquidity and financial covenant requirements under its debt covenants pursuant to its Credit Agreement for at least the next twelve months. The forecasted operating cash flows include the shipping of the remainder of the Company's existing Cambodian NHP inventory. See Note 7 - Debt to our consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 for further information about the Company s existing credit facilities and requirements under its debt covenants. The Company s liquidity needs and com pliance with covenants depend, among other things, on its ability to source and sell NHPs, its ability to fill its expanded DSA capacity, its ability to generate cash from other operating activities and its ability to manage its forecasted capital expenditures. 
 Comparative Cash Flow Analysis 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 35.5 million compared to 19.0 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of September 30, 2022. As of September 30, 2023, we had no borrowings on our 15.0 million revolving credit facility compared to 15.0 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2022.

 50 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 borrowings under a new senior secured term loan facility, to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Envigo acquisition and related fees and expenses. 
 The Notes are the Company s senior, unsecured obligations and are (i) equal in right of payment with the Company s existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to the Company s existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to the Company s existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, and (to the extent the Company is not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of the Company s non-guarantor subsidiaries.

 The Notes accrue interest at a rate of 3.25 per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on April 15, 2022. The Notes will mature on October 15, 2027, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Before April 15, 2027, noteholders have the right to convert their Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. From and after April 15, 2027, noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, its common shares or a combination of cash and its common shares, at the Company s election. The initial conversion rate is 21.7162 common shares per 1 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately 46.05 per common share. The conversion rate and conversion price are subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time. 
 As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, there were 4.2 million and 5.1 million, respectively, in unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Notes. For the year ended September 30, 2023, the total interest expense was 11.1 million, including coupon interest expense of 4.5 million, accretion expense of 5.7 million, and the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of 0.9 million. For the year ended September 30, 2022, the total interest expense was 10.6 million, including coupon interest expense of 4.6 million, accretion expense of 5.2 million, and the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of 0.8 million. 
 The Notes are redeemable, in whole and not in part, at the Company s option at any time on or after October 15, 2024 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per common share of the Company exceeds 130.00 of the conversion price on (i) each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends the related redemption notice; and (ii) the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such notice. The redemption price is a cash amount equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, calling the Notes for redemption pursuant to the provisions described in this paragraph will constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change, which will result in an increase to the conversion rate in certain circumstances for a specified period of time. 
 If certain corporate events that constitute a Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then noteholders may require the Company to repurchase their Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Fundamental Change repurchase date. The definition of Fundamental Change includes certain business combination transactions involving the Company and certain de-listing events with respect to the Company s common shares. 
 The Notes have customary provisions relating to the occurrence of Events of Default (as defined in the Indenture), which include the following: (i) certain payment defaults on the Notes (which, in the case of a default in the payment of interest on the Notes, are subject to a 30-day cure period); (ii) the Company s failure to send certain notices under the Indenture within specified periods of time; (iii) the failure by the Company or the Guarantor to comply with certain covenants in the Indenture relating to the ability of the Company or the Guarantor to consolidate with or merge with or into, or sell, lease or otherwise transfer, in one transaction or a series of transactions, all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to another person; (iv) a default by the Company or the Guarantor in its other obligations or agreements under the Indenture or the Notes if such default is not cured or waived within 60 days after notice is given in accordance with the Indenture; (v) certain defaults by the Company, the Guarantor or any of their respective subsidiaries with respect to indebtedness for borrowed money of at least 20.0 million; (vi) the rendering of certain judgments against the Company, the Guarantor or any of their respective subsidiaries for the payment of at least 20.0 million, where such judgments are not discharged or stayed within 60 days after the date on which the 
 51 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 right to appeal has expired or on which all rights to appeal have been extinguished; (vii) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization involving the Company, the Guarantor or any of their respective significant subsidiaries; and (viii) the guarantee of the Notes ceases to be in full force and effect (except as permitted by the Indenture) or the Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under its guarantee of the Notes. 
 If an Event of Default involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization events with respect to the Company or the Guarantor (and not solely with respect to a significant subsidiary of the Company or the Guarantor) occurs, then the principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the Notes then outstanding will immediately become due and payable without any further action or notice by any person. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, then the trustee, by notice to the Company, or noteholders of at least 25.00 of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding, by notice to the Company and the trustee, may declare the principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the Notes then outstanding to become due and payable immediately. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may elect, at its option, that the sole remedy for an Event of Default relating to certain failures by the Company to comply with certain reporting covenants in the Indenture consists exclusively of the right of the noteholders to receive special interest on the Notes for up to 180 days at a specified rate per annum not exceeding 0.50 on the principal amount of the Notes. 
 
 Inflation 
 We do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S.). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods and related disclosures. These estimates and assumptions are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on our historical experience, trends in the industry, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 We believe that the application of our accounting policies, each of which require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 We believe the following represent our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements: 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606, the Company disaggregates its revenue from clients into two revenue streams, service revenue and product revenue. At contract inception, the Company assesses the services and/or products promised in the contract with the clients to identify performance obligations in the arrangements. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company determines appropriate revenue recognition by completing the following steps: (i) identifying the contract(s) with a client; (ii) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determining the transaction price; (iv) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognizing revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation. 
 Service revenue 
 DSA 
 The Company enters into contracts with clients to provide drug discovery and development services. The Company also offers archive storage services to its clients. The Company s fixed fee arrangements may involve nonclinical research 
 52 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 services (e.g., toxicology, pathology, pharmacology), bioanalytical, and pharmaceutical method development and validation, nonclinical research services and the analysis of bioanalytical and pharmaceutical samples. For bioanalytical and pharmaceutical method validation services and nonclinical research services, revenue is recognized over time using the input method based on the ratio of direct costs incurred to total estimated direct costs. For contracts that involve in-life study conduct, method development or the analysis of bioanalytical and pharmaceutical samples, revenue is recognized over time when samples are analyzed or when services are performed. In determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize over time, the Company forecasts remaining costs related to the contracts with clients. In order to forecast the remaining costs, the Company reviews the billings compared to original cost estimates, meets with project managers and updates cost estimates in relation to any scope changes requested by the client. 
 The Company generally bills for services on a milestone basis. These contracts represent a single performance obligation and due to the Company s right to payment for work performed, revenue is recognized over time. Research services contract fees received upon acceptance are deferred until earned and classified within fees invoiced in advance on the consolidated balance sheets. Unbilled revenues represent revenues earned under contracts in advance of billings and are classified within trade receivables and contract assets on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 Our service contracts typically establish a fixed fee to be paid for identified services. In most cases, some percentage of the contract costs is paid in advance. While we are performing a contract, clients often adjust the scope of services to be provided based on interim project results. Fees are adjusted accordingly. Generally, our fee-for-service contracts are terminable by the client upon written notice of 30 days or less for a variety of reasons, including the client s decision to forego a particular study, the failure of product prototypes to satisfy safety requirements, and unexpected or undesired results of product testing. Cancellation or delay of ongoing contracts may result in fluctuations in our and annual results. We are generally able to recover, at minimum, our invested costs plus an appropriate margin when contracts are terminated. 
 RMS 
 The Company provides GEMS, which include the performance of contract breeding and other services associated with genetically engineered models, client-owned animal colony care, and health monitoring and diagnostics services related to research models. For contracts that involve creation of a specific type of animal, revenue is recognized over time with each milestone as a separate performance obligation. The Company is due payment for work performed even if subsequent milestones are unable to be met. Contract breeding revenue and client-owned animal colony care revenue are recognized over time and are billed as per diems. Health monitoring revenue and diagnostic services revenue are recognized once the service is performed. 
 Product revenue 
 DSA 
 DSA product revenue includes internally-manufactured scientific instruments for life sciences research and the related software for use by pharmaceutical companies, universities, government research centers and medical research institutions under the Company s BASi product line. These products can be sold to multiple clients and have alternative uses. Both the transaction sales price and shipping terms are agreed upon in the client order. For these products, all revenue is recognized at a point in time, generally when title of the product and control is transferred to the client based upon shipping terms. These arrangements typically include only one performance obligation. 
 RMS 
 Product revenue includes research models, diets and bedding and bioproducts. Research models revenue represents the commercial production and sale of research models. Diets and bedding revenue represents laboratory animal diets, bedding, and enrichment products under the Company s Teklad product line. Bioproducts revenue represents the sale of serum and plasma, whole blood, tissues, organs and glands, embryo culture serum and growth factors. Product revenue is recognized at the point in time when the Company s performance obligations with the applicable clients have been satisfied. Revenue is recorded at the transaction price, which is the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring products to a client. The performance obligations, including associated freight to deliver products, are met based agreed upon terms, which are generally upon delivery (destination point) and transfer of title. The Company determines the transaction price based on fixed consideration in its contractual agreements. In determining the transaction 
 53 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 price, a significant financing component does not exist since the timing from when the Company delivers product to when the clients pay for the product is less than one year. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 The Company uses the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Deferred taxes are measured using rates expected to apply to taxable income in years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
 The Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If the Company determines that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, the Company would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. 
 The Company uses a two-step process for the measurement of uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is a determination of whether the tax position should be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The second step determines the measurement of the tax position. The Company records potential interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. 
 As of November 5, 2021, with the acquisition of Envigo, the Company adopted an accounting policy regarding the treatment of taxes due on future inclusion of non-U.S. income in U.S. taxable income under the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income provisions as a current period expense when incurred. 
 
 Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
 We use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of our acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to the fair value. We utilize commonly accepted valuation techniques, such as the income, cost and market approaches, as appropriate, in establishing the fair value of intangible assets. Typically, key assumptions include projections of cash flows that arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses as well as discount rates based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific risks associated with the assets. Customer relationship intangible assets are the most significant identifiable definite-lived asset acquired. To determine the fair value of the acquired customer relationships, the Company typically utilizes the multiple period excess earnings model (a commonly accepted valuation technique), which relies on the following key assumptions: projections of cash flows from the acquired entities, which includes future revenue growth rates, operating income (loss) margins, and customer attrition rates; as well as discount rates based on an analysis of the acquired entities weighted average cost of capital. 
 Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed when accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized, but reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, utilizing an assessment date of September 30th, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of the Company's reporting units below their carrying amounts. 
 The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. If the Company elects this option and believes, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the carrying value of goodwill is not recoverable, the quantitative impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. Alternatively, the Company may elect to not first assess qualitative factors and immediately perform the quantitative impairment test. In the quantitative test, the Company compares the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying values. The estimated cash flows used to determine the fair value of the reporting units used in the impairment test requires significant judgment with respect to revenue growth, EBITDA margin, and weighted average cost of capital. If the carrying values of the net assets assigned to the reporting units exceed the fair values of the reporting units an impairment loss equal to the difference would be recorded. See Note 6 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets

 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion related to goodwill impairment charges during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022. 
 Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are utilized and qualitatively reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable. If quantitative determination of recoverability is required, recoverability of assets to be held and used is determined by the Company at the level for which there are identifiable cash flows by comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows utilizing forecasted revenue growth, EBITDA margin, and capital expenditures before interest expense and income taxes expected to be generated by the assets. If the carrying amount exceeds the outcome of the analysis of undiscounted cash flows, impairment is measured through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values, and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the definite-lived intangible assets, the definite-lived intangible assets are written-down to their fair values. 
 The Company amortizes the cost of its intangible assets utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the definite-lived intangible assets as follows: 
 Asset 
 Estimated Useful Lives 
 (in years) 
 Customer relationships 
 5 - 13 
 Intellectual property 
 5 - 20 
 Other 
 0 - 15 
 
 Long-lived Tangible Assets 
 Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets, the assets are written-down to their fair values. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are carried at fair value less costs to sell. 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company s judgment about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the inputs as follows: 
 
 Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access. 
 Level 2 Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. 
 Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 
 
 Valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value are disclosed in Note 7 Debt and Note 9 Post-Employment Benefits. 
 Pension Costs 
 As a result of the Envigo acquisition, the Company has a defined benefit pension plan for one of its U.K. subsidiaries. 
 The projected benefit obligation and funded position of the defined benefit plan is estimated by actuaries and the Company recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit plan on its consolidated balance sheets and recognizes gains, losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period that are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. The Company measures plan assets and 
 55 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 obligations as of the date of the Company s year-end consolidated balance sheet, using assumptions to anticipate future events. 
 Additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition assets or obligations are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements (see Note 9 Post-Employment Benefits). 
 Our significant accounting policies, including new accounting pronouncements, are described in more detail in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in response to Item 8 of this Report.

 ITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing financing activities. As of September 30, 2023, our debt portfolio was reliant on reference rates. Based on our interest rate exposure at September 30, 2023, assumed debt levels throughout the next 12 months, a one-percentage-point increase in interest rates would result in an estimated 2.7 million pre-tax reduction in net earnings over a one-year period. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 We operate on a global basis and have exposure to some foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 While the financial results of our global activities are reported in U.S. dollars, our foreign subsidiaries typically conduct their operations in their respective local currency. The principal functional currencies of the Company s foreign subsidiaries are the Euro, British Pound and Israeli Shekel. 
 Fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of the countries in which we do business will affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. As the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, the value of our non-U.S. revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, and cash flows will generally decline when reported in U.S. dollars. The impact to net income (loss) as a result of a U.S. dollar strengthening will be partially mitigated by the value of non-U.S. expenses, which will decline when reported in U.S. dollars. As the U.S. dollar weakens versus other currencies, the value of the non-U.S. revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, and cash flows will generally increase when reported in U.S. dollars. 
 A hypothetical 10 change in the foreign exchange rates applicable to our business would change our cash balance as of September 30, 2023 by approximately 0.3 million and our revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 by approximately 9.0 million.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
 To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Inotiv, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Inotiv, Inc. (the Company) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated December 11, 2023 expressed an adverse opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account s or disclosure s to which it relates.

Revenue recognition for Over Time Service Contracts 
 
 Description of the matter 
 For the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded service revenue of 223.8 million. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives a portion of its revenues from service revenue contracts which include fixed fee arrangements. Certain of these service revenue contracts are recognized over time Over Time Service Contracts using the input method based on the ratio of direct costs incurred to date under the contract to total estimated direct costs expected to be incurred to complete the contract. 
 
 Auditing the revenue recognition related to Over Time Service Contracts can be challenging due to the judgment by management in determining the timing of recognition of revenue as services are provided, including the Company s estimate of expected costs to be incurred to complete the contract. Auditing the estimate of expected costs involved a high degree of auditor judgment and increased audit effort due to the determination of the current status of the contract and remaining cost to complete and their impact on the amount of revenue recognized. 
 
 How we addressed the matter in our audit 
 Our audit procedures relating to management s estimates included, among others, selecting a sample of contracts and comparing the transaction prices to the consideration expected to be received based on current rights and obligations under the contracts and any contract modifications that were agreed upon with the customers. We tested costs incurred and applied to contracts for accuracy, existence, completeness, and proper classification. We evaluated the reasonableness of management s forecast of remaining costs for the selected contracts, which included understanding the current status of the contract, comparing current estimated costs to original estimates and corroborating our understanding of the status and remaining cost estimates of projects through discussions with project managers. Lastly, we evaluated the reasonableness of management s estimate by comparing final contract costs to cost estimates for a sample of historical in-process service contracts completed in the current year.

 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Inotiv, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited Inotiv, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Inotiv, Inc. (the Company) has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management s assessment. Management has identified material weaknesses related to: 
 
 a) Management did not design and maintain effective controls over information technology general controls (ITGCs) for all applications that are relevant to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements throughout the year ended September 30, 2023, which resulted in ineffective business process controls (automated and IT-dependent manual controls) that could result in misstatements potentially impacting all of the financial statement accounts and disclosures; and 
 
 b) the Company did not effectively design and implement components of the COSO framework to address all relevant risks of material misstatement, including elements of the control environment, information and communication, control activities and monitoring activities components, relating to: (i) providing sufficient and timely management oversight and ownership over the internal control evaluation process; (ii) hiring and training sufficient personnel to timely support the Company s internal control objectives; and (iii) performing timely monitoring and oversight to ascertain whether the components of internal control are present and functioning effectively. As a result, controls relevant to all business processes and related controls (including relevant entity level controls) were deemed ineffective at September 30, 2023. 
 
 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company. These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2023 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated December 11, 2023, which expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with 
 61 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 Cambodian government officials, with conspiring to illegally import NHPs into the U.S. from December 2017 through January 2022 and in connection with specific imports between July 2018 and December 2021 (the "November 16, 2022 event"). The Company has not been directed to refrain from selling the Cambodian NHPs in its possession in the U.S. However, due to the allegations contained in the indictment involving the supplier and the Cambodian government officials, the Company believed that it was prudent, at the time, to refrain from selling or delivering any of its Cambodian NHPs held in the U.S. until the Company s staff and external experts could evaluate what additionally could be done to satisfy itself that the NHPs in inventory from Cambodia can be reasonably determined to be purpose-bred. Historically, the Company relied on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora CITES documentation and related processes and procedures, including release of each import by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. After a thorough review of the documentation we have for the Cambodian NHPs in our inventory and their colonies, we resumed shipping a limited amount of Cambodian NHPs. In addition, we completed audits on site at our Cambodian supplier and we worked to establish even more robust procedures for future imports. We have focused on working with our suppliers and developing a long-term solution to establish procedures we can be comfortable assuring ourselves, and our customers, we only provide purpose bred NHPs from Cambodia. We have scientists inside and outside our organization working towards establishing new testing procedures for importing purpose bred Cambodian NHPs and meeting the needs of drug discovery and development in the U.S. In the meantime, we continued to import from countries outside of Cambodia to satisfy demand at our DSA business segment and to our RMS clients. 
 The Company believes its existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund its operations, satisfy its obligations, including cash outflows for planned targeted capital expenditures, and comply with minimum liquidity and financial covenant requirements under its debt covenants pursuant to its Credit Agreement for at least the next twelve months. The forecasted operating cash flows include the shipping of the Company's existing Cambodian NHP inventory. See Note 7 - Debt to our consolidated financial statements for further information about the Company s existing credit facilities and requirements under its debt covenants. The Company s liquidity needs and com pliance with covenants depend, among other things, on its ability to source and sell NHPs, its ability to fill its expanded DSA capacity, its ability to generate cash from other operating activities and its ability to manage its forecasted capital expenditures.

 revenue streams, service revenue and product revenue. At contract inception, the Company assesses the services and/or products promised in the contract with the clients to identify performance obligations in the arrangements. In accordance with ASC 606, the Company determines appropriate revenue recognition by completing the following steps: (i) identifying the contract(s) with a client; (ii) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determining the transaction price; (iv) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognizing revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation. 
 Service revenue 
 DSA 
 The Company enters into contracts with clients to provide drug discovery and development services. The Company also offers archive storage services to its clients. The Company s fixed fee arrangements may involve nonclinical research services (e.g., toxicology, pathology, pharmacology), bioanalytical, and pharmaceutical method development and validation, nonclinical research services and the analysis of bioanalytical and pharmaceutical samples. For bioanalytical and pharmaceutical method validation services and nonclinical research services, revenue is recognized over time using the input method based on the ratio of direct costs incurred to total estimated direct costs. For contracts that involve in-life study conduct, method development or the analysis of bioanalytical and pharmaceutical samples, revenue is recognized over time when samples are analyzed or when services are performed. In determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize over time, the Company forecasts remaining costs related to the contracts with clients. In order to forecast the remaining costs, the Company reviews the billings compared to original cost estimates, meets with project managers and updates cost estimates in relation to any scope changes requested by the client. 
 The Company generally bills for services on a milestone basis. These contracts represent a single performance obligation and due to the Company s right to payment for work performed, revenue is recognized over time. Research services contract fees received upon acceptance are deferred until earned and classified within fees invoiced in advance on the consolidated balance sheets. Unbilled revenues represent revenues earned under contracts in advance of billings and are classified within trade receivables and contract assets on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 Our service contracts typically establish a fixed fee to be paid for identified services. In most cases, some percentage of the contract costs is paid in advance. While we are performing a contract, clients often adjust the scope of services to be provided based on interim project results. Fees are adjusted accordingly. Generally, our fee-for-service contracts are terminable by the client upon written notice of days or less for a variety of reasons, including the client s decision to forego a particular study, the failure of product prototypes to satisfy safety requirements, and unexpected or undesired results of product testing. Cancellation or delay of ongoing contracts may result in fluctuations in our annual results. We are generally able to recover, at a minimum, our invested costs plus an appropriate margin when contracts are terminated. 
 RMS 
 The Company provides GEMS, which include the performance of contract breeding and other services associated with genetically engineered models, client-owned animal colony care, and health monitoring and diagnostics services related to research models. For contracts that involve creation of a specific type of animal, revenue is recognized over time with each milestone as a separate performance obligation. The Company is due payment for work performed even if subsequent milestones are unable to be met. Contract breeding revenue and client-owned animal colony care revenue are recognized over time and are billed as per diems. Health monitoring revenue and diagnostic services revenue are recognized once the service is performed. 
 Product revenue 
 DSA 
 DSA product revenue includes internally-manufactured scientific instruments for life sciences research and the related software for use by pharmaceutical companies, universities, government research centers and medical research institutions under the Company s BASi product line. These products can be sold to multiple clients and have alternative uses. Both the transaction sales price and shipping terms are agreed upon in the client order. For these products, all revenue is recognized

 Fiscal Year 2023 
 
 The increase in goodwill during fiscal year 2023 related primarily to measurement period adjustments in the DSA segment from the acquisition of Protypia, partially offset by goodwill impairment related to the RMS reporting unit (which is reported within the RMS segment). 
 
 On November 16, 2022, the Company became aware that the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Southern District of Florida USAO-SDFL had criminally charged employees of the principal supplier of non-human primates NHPs to the Company, along with Cambodian government officials, with conspiring to illegally import NHPs into the U.S. from December 2017 through January 2022 and in connection with specific imports between July 2018 and December 2021 (the November 16, 2022 event ). During December 2022, the Company determined that as a result of the November 16, 2022 event, which led to the Company s decision to refrain from selling or delivering any of its Cambodian NHPs held in the U.S. at that time, the uncertainty related to the Company s ability to import NHPs from Cambodia and the decrease in its stock price, the carrying value of goodwill as of December 31, 2022, was required to be quantitatively evaluated. The carrying value of the Company s goodwill by reporting unit was determined utilizing the income approach. Based on the Company s quantitative goodwill impairment test, the fair value of the RMS reporting unit was less than the RMS reporting unit s carrying value. As a result, a goodwill impairment loss of was recorded within the RMS segment. 
 
 Fiscal Year 2022 
 The increase in goodwill during fiscal year 2022 primarily related to the acquisitions of Plato, ILS, Histion and Protypia in the DSA reporting unit and Envigo, RSI and OBRC in the RMS reporting unit, offset by goodwill impairment related to the RMS reporting unit. See Note 3 - Business Combinations for further discussion of these business combinations. 
 As a part of the annual goodwill assessment, the Company first assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. As a result of the qualitative analysis, the Company determined that as a result of the sustained reduction in our stock price during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the carrying value of our goodwill as of fiscal year end must be quantitatively evaluated. The carrying value of the Company s goodwill by reporting unit was determined utilizing the income approach. Based on the Company s quantitative goodwill impairment test, which was performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, the fair value of the RMS reporting unit was less than the RMS reporting unit s carrying value. As a result, goodwill impairment losses of were recorded.

 of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding, by notice to the Company and the trustee, may declare the principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the Notes then outstanding to become due and payable immediately. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may elect, at its option, that the sole remedy for an Event of Default relating to certain failures by the Company to comply with certain reporting covenants in the Indenture consists exclusively of the right of the noteholders to receive special interest on the Notes for up to days at a specified rate per annum not exceeding on the principal amount of the Notes. 
 In accordance with ASC 815, at issuance, the Company evaluated the convertible feature of the Notes and determined it was required to be bifurcated as an embedded derivative and did not qualify for equity classification.

As a result of the approval of the increase in authorized shares on November 4, 2021 (see Note 13 Stockholders Equity and Loss Per Share), the Note conversion rights met all equity classification criteria in ASC 815. As a result, the derivative liability was remeasured as of November 4, 2021 and reclassified out of long-term liabilities and into additional paid-in capital. 
 Based upon the above, the Company remeasured and reclassified to additional paid-in capital the fair value of the embedded derivative as of November 4, 2021, which resulted in a fair value measurement of and a loss on remeasurement included in other income (loss) for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022of .

 Increase in Authorized Shares and Equity Plan Reserve 
 On November 4, 2021, the Company s shareholders approved an amendment to the Company s Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares from shares, consisting of common shares and preferred shares, to shares, consisting of common shares and preferred shares. Approval of this matter by the Inotiv shareholders was a condition to the closing of the Envigo acquisition. The amendment was effective on November 4, 2021. On November 4, 2021, the Company s shareholders approved an amendment to the Company s 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the Equity Plan to increase the number of shares available for awards thereunder by shares and to make certain corresponding changes to certain limitations in the Equity Plan.

 (1) Anti-dilutive common share equivalents are comprised of stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards and shares of common stock issuable upon conversion in connection with the convertible debt entered into on September 27, 2021.These common share equivalents were outstanding for the periods presented, but were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share for those periods because their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect. 
 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
 Within the statement of operations, foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized as a result of translations of non-functional currencies. In relation to the translation into U.S. dollars, except for defined benefit pension costs of the Pension Plan, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated using the current exchange rate. For those operations, changes in exchange rates generally do not affect cash flows; therefore, resulting translation adjustments are made in shareholders' equity rather than in the consolidated statements of operations. The Pension Plan relates to a U.K. subsidiary, which currently records a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets. 
 As a result, income tax effects on the net activity have not been presented related to each component of other comprehensive loss for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.

 U.S. GAAP requires that valuation allowances should be established against deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. The Company assesses its deferred income taxes to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and amount of recent losses, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and tax planning strategies. In making such judgments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. 
 The Company s U.S. tax reporting group has a cumulative three-year loss. The valuation allowance related to the Company s U.S. tax reporting group as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 was and , respectively, and the valuation allowance related to the Company's non-U.S. entities was and , respectively, as the Company does not believe that certain deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. Payments made in fiscal years 2023 and 2022 for income taxes, net of refunds, amounted to and , respectively. 
 The Company s non-U.S. subsidiaries cumulative undistributed earnings, projected as of September 30, 2023, are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes or withholding taxes has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Further, a determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability for the amount indefinitely reinvested is not practicable due to the complexities in the tax laws and assumptions we would have to make. As of November 5, 2021, with the acquisition of Envigo, the Company adopted an accounting policy regarding the treatment of taxes due on future inclusion of non-U.S. income in U.S. taxable income under the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income provisions as a current period expense when incurred. Therefore, deferred tax related to these provisions has been recorded as of September 30, 2023.

 , which have been fully offset by valuation allowance. These losses may be carried forward indefinitely. 
 The Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained upon regulatory examination based on the technical merits of the position. The amount of the benefit for which an exposure exists is measured as the largest amount of benefit determined on a cumulative probability basis that we believe is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the position. As of September 30, 2023, there were no material uncertain tax positions based on any federal or state tax position. In fiscal year 2022, the Company established an uncertain tax position of in accordance with ASC 805-740 to directly offset acquired foreign net operating losses of within the foreign net deferred tax liability. The position was settled during fiscal year 2023. 
 The Company is no longer subject to U.S. Federal tax examinations for years before 2018 or state and local for years before 2017, with limited exceptions. For federal purposes, the tax attributes carried forward could be adjusted through the examination process and are subject to examination 3 years from the date of utilization.

 which includes attorneys fees. The MOU provides that the parties will negotiate and enter into a definitive settlement agreement, which will be subject to court approval. The MOU contains no admission of liability or wrongdoing by Envigo RMS. The MOU provides that, if the settlement is approved by the court, the settlement amount would be paid in four quarterly installments, with the first one to be funded after the court s final approval of the settlement, and the following ones in the three subsequent quarters. While the timeline for final court approval is not yet determined, the Company took a reserve equal to the proposed settlement amount, which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities. 
 
 On June 23, 2022, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana, naming the Company and Robert W. Leasure and Beth A. Taylor as defendants, captioned Grobler v. Inotiv, Inc., et al., Case No. 4:22-cv-00045 (N.D. Ind.). The complaint alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, based on alleged false and misleading statements and material omissions regarding the Company s acquisition of Envigo RMS and its regulatory compliance. On September 12, 2022, Oklahoma Police Pension and Retirement System was appointed by the Court as lead plaintiff. Thereafter, on November 14, 2022, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint against the same defendants, in addition to John E. Sagartz and Carmen Wilbourn, that asserted the same claims along with a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act. On November 23, 2022, the lead plaintiff filed a further amended complaint against the aforementioned defendants asserting the same claims as the amended complaint and further alleging that false and misleading statements and material omissions were made concerning the Company s non-human primate business. The purported class in the operative complaint includes all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company s common stock between September 21, 2021 and November 16, 2022, and the complaint seeks an unspecified amount of monetary damages, interest, fees and expenses of attorneys and experts, and other relief. On January 27, 2023, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion has been fully briefed since April 28, 2023, and is currently pending. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of this matter, the Company believes the class action to be without merit and plans to vigorously defend itself. We cannot reasonably estimate the maximum potential exposure or the range of possible loss in excess of amounts accrued for this matter.

 ITEM 9A CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms adopted by the SEC, including to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President of Finance (our principal financial officer), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure ("Management"). 
 
 Management has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, Management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2023 because of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 
 Notwithstanding the conclusion by Management that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2023 were not effective, and notwithstanding the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below, Management believes that the consolidated financial statements and related financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates presented, and for the periods ended on such dates, in conformity with U.S. GAAP. 
 
 Management s report on internal control over financial reporting 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of Management and effected by the Company s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 
 
 a. Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company 
 b. Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 
 c. Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting can also be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.

Tab l e o f Contents 

 As of September 30, 2022, Management excluded several of the Company s previous acquisitions from its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as permitted by applicable rules. Management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, now includes all previous acquisitions. 
 
 Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. In making this assessment, Management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on that assessment, Management concluded that, as of September 30, 2023, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was not effective, due to the material weaknesses described below. 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 As of September 30, 2022, Management identified the following material weaknesses in internal controls, which continued to exist as of September 30, 2023: 
 
 a. Management did not design and maintain effective controls over information technology general controls (ITGCs) for all applications that are relevant to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements throughout the year ended September 30, 2022, which resulted in ineffective business process controls (automated and IT-dependent manual controls) that could result in misstatements potentially impacting all of the financial statement accounts and disclosures. Specifically, management did not design and maintain: sufficient user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and adequately restrict user and privileged access to financial applications, programs and data to appropriate Company personnel; and program change management controls to ensure that information technology IT program and data changes affecting financial information technology applications and underlying accounting records are authorized, tested, and implemented appropriately. As a result, business process controls (automated and IT-dependent manual controls) that are dependent on the ineffective ITGCs, or that use data produced from systems impacted by the ineffective ITGCs were deemed ineffective at September 30, 2022, and were not remediated and therefore remained ineffective at September 30, 2023; and 
 
 b. Management did not have an adequate process in place to design and test the operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner or an adequate process in place to monitor and provide oversight over the completion of its assessment of internal control over financial reporting. As such, we determined that management did not effectively design and implement components of the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (COSO framework) to address all relevant risks of material misstatement, including elements of the control environment, information and communication, control activities and monitoring activities components, relating to: (i) providing sufficient and timely management oversight and ownership over the internal control evaluation process; (ii) hiring and training sufficient personnel to timely support the Company s internal control objectives; and (iii) performing timely monitoring and oversight to ascertain whether the components of internal control are present and functioning effectively. As a result, controls relevant to all business processes and related controls (including relevant entity level controls) were deemed ineffective at September 30, 2022, and were not remediated and therefore remained ineffective at September 30, 2023. 
 
 As a result of the material weaknesses described above, the Company s management has concluded that, as of September 30, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective. The material weaknesses did not result in any identified misstatements to our consolidated financial statements, and there were no changes to previously released financial results. The Company s independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and has issued an adverse report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, as set forth below. 
 
 Remediation of the Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management has updated the design of several of its controls and modified process designs in an effort to improve our internal control over financial reporting and remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weaknesses, described above. However, there remain several controls and processes 
 115 

Tab l e o f Contents 

 that management continues to re-assess, including the design of controls and modifying processes to improve our internal control over financial reporting. Management s remediation efforts have included but are not limited to: (i) hiring additional accounting personnel, (ii) hiring key IT personnel with appropriate technical and internal control-related skillsets, and (iii) implementing an internal team dedicated to oversight of control and process design. Management s ongoing remediation efforts include: (i) improving consistency in ITGCs supported by standard operating procedures to govern the authorization, testing and approval of changes to IT systems supporting all of the Company s internal control processes, including the implementation of certain applications to achieve these operating procedures, (ii) enhancing design and implementation of our control environment, including the expansion of formal accounting and IT policies and procedures, (iii) designing, implementing, reviewing, analyzing, and properly documenting our review and approval controls, as it relates to ITGCs, account reconciliations, journal entries and estimates, and (iv) continuing to provide training to personnel related to ensuring the accuracy and completeness of data used in the performance of the internal controls. 
 
 The material weaknesses cannot be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 As of September 30, 2022, management had excluded several of its previous acquisitions from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting; however, management's assessment as of September 30, 2023, as described above, now includes the operations of all previous acquisitions. Except for the remediation efforts related to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described above, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 97.1 
 INOTIV, INC. 
 COMPENSATION RECOVERY POLICY 
 
 Effective October 2, 2023 
 
 Policy 
 
 The Board of Directors (the Board of Inotiv, Inc. (the Company has adopted this Compensation Recovery Policy (this Policy pursuant to Rule 10D-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC regulations promulgated thereunder, and applicable Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq listing standards. Subject to and in accordance with the terms of this Policy, upon a Recoupment Event, each Covered Executive shall be obligated to return to the Company, reasonably promptly, the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation that was received by such Covered Executive during the Lookback Period. 
 
 Administration 
 
 This Policy will be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the Committee ). Any determinations made by the Committee will be final and binding on all affected individuals. 
 
 Definitions 
 
 Accounting Restatement means an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. 
 
 Covered Executive means each of the Company s current and former executive officers who is or was an officer of the Company within the meaning of Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act. 
 
 Erroneously Awarded Compensation means, with respect to each Covered Executive in connection with an Accounting Restatement, the excess of the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation received by the Covered Executive during the Lookback Period over the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts, computed without regard to any taxes paid. For Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an Accounting Restatement (a) the amount must be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was received and (b) the Company must maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to Nasdaq. 
 
 Financial Reporting Measures are any measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s financial statements, and any measures derived wholly or in part from such measures. Stock price and total shareholder return are also Financial Reporting Measures. A Financial Reporting Measure need not be presented within the financial statements or included in a filing with the SEC. 
 
 Incentive-Based Compensation is any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure. 
 
 Lookback Period means the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the Required Restatement Date and any transition period (that results from a change in the Company s fiscal year) of less than nine months within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years. 

A Recoupment Event occurs when the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement. 
 
 Required Restatement Date means the earlier to occur of (a) the date the Company s Board, a committee of the Board, or the officer(s) of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, or (b) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement. 
 
 Section 409A means Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder. 
 
 Amount Subject to Recovery 
 
 The Incentive-Based Compensation that is subject to recovery under this Policy includes such compensation that is received by a Covered Executive (i) on or after October 2, 2023 (even if such Incentive-Based Compensation was approved, awarded or granted prior to that date), (ii) after the individual began service as a Covered Executive, (iii) if the individual served as a Covered Executive at any time during the performance period for such Incentive-Based Compensation, and (iv) while the Company has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or national securities association. 
 
 The amount of Incentive-Based Compensation subject to recovery from a Covered Executive upon a Recoupment Event is the Erroneously Awarded Compensation, which amount shall be determined by the Committee in accordance with this Policy. 
 
 For purposes of this Policy, Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed received in the Company s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period. 
 
 Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation 
 
 Promptly following a Recoupment Event, the Committee will determine the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation for each Covered Executive, and the Company will provide each such Covered Executive with a written notice of such amount and a demand for repayment or return. Upon receipt of such notice, each affected Covered Executive shall promptly repay or return such Erroneously Awarded Compensation to the Company. 
 
 If such repayment or return is not made within a reasonable time, the Company shall recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation in a reasonable and prompt manner using any lawful method determined by the Committee provided that recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation must be made in compliance with Section 409A. The applicable Covered Executive shall also be required to reimburse the Company for any and all expenses (including legal fees) reasonably incurred by the Company in recovering such Erroneously Awarded Compensation in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 
 
 Limited Exceptions 
 
 Erroneously Awarded Compensation will be recovered in accordance with this Policy unless the Committee determines that recovery would be impracticable and one of the following conditions is met 
 
 the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered, provided the Company has first made a reasonable effort to recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation or 
 
 the recovery would likely cause a U.S. tax-qualified retirement plan to fail to meet the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Sections 401(a)(13) and 411(a) and the regulations thereunder. 
 
 Reliance on any of the above exemptions will further comply with applicable listing standards, including without limitation, documenting the reason for the impracticability and providing required documentation to Nasdaq. 

No Insurance or Indemnification 
 
 Neither the Company nor any of its affiliates or subsidiaries may indemnify any Covered Executive against the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation (or related expenses incurred by the Covered Executive) pursuant to a recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation under this Policy, nor will the Company nor any of its affiliates or subsidiaries pay or reimburse a Covered Executive for any insurance premiums on any insurance policy obtained by the Covered Executive to protect against the forfeiture or recovery of any compensation pursuant to this Policy. 
 
 Interpretation 
 
 The Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy. This Policy shall be applied and interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of Rule 10D-1 and any applicable regulations, rules or standards adopted by SEC or the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the Company s securities are listed. In the event that this Policy does not meet the requirements of Rule 10D-1, the SEC regulations promulgated thereunder, or the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the Company s securities are listed, this Policy shall be deemed to be amended to meet such requirements. 
 
 Indemnification of Policy Administrators 
 
 Any members of the Committee who participate in the administration of this Policy shall not be personally liable for any action, determination or interpretation made with respect to this Policy and shall be fully indemnified by the Company to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law and Company governing documents and policies with respect to any such action, determination or interpretation. The foregoing shall not limit any other rights to indemnification of the members of the Committee under applicable law or Company governing documents and policies. 
 
 Amendment Termination 
 
 The Board or the Committee may amend this Policy in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to comply with the regulations adopted by the SEC under Rule 10D-1 and the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the Company s securities are listed. The Board or the Committee may terminate this Policy at any time. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no amendment or termination of this Policy shall be effective if that amendment or termination would cause the Company to violate any federal securities laws, SEC rules or the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the Company s securities are listed. 
 
 Other Recoupment Rights 
 
 The Board intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. Any Incentive-Based Compensation provided for in an employment agreement, incentive compensation plan, policy, program or agreement, equity award, or similar plan, program or agreement shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, be subject to the terms of this Policy. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any similar provision in any employment agreement, incentive compensation plan policy, program or agreement, equity award, or similar plan, program or agreement and any other legal remedies available to the Company. This Policy is in addition to any other clawback or compensation recovery, recoupment or forfeiture policy in effect or that may be adopted by the Company from time to time, or any laws, rules or listing standards applicable to the Company, including without limitation, the Company s right to recoup compensation subject to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 
 
 Successors 
 
 This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives.
