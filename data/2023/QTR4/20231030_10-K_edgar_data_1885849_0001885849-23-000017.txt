DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

In General 

 Tofla Megaline Inc. Tofla was
incorporated in the state of Nevada on August 31, 2018. Tofla has only one officer and director who is Rodolfo Guerrero Angulo. We are
a development stage Company and operate in the business of software development for robotic devices. We provide easy-to-use, high quality
and cost-effective automation AI solutions. Tofla is focused on both stand-alone and integrated solutions in order to cover a broader
selection of services, especially in the surveillance area. Using autonomous robotic units as a means of surveillance is a new tendency
all over the globe. Robotic units can be used for patrolling warehouses, malls, backyards, office areas, buildings, etc. Our focus is
on developing specialized software for the units that will cover all the necessary functionality for surveillance and data transfer. We
have initiated business activities and have generated revenues, however, there is no assurance that we will be successful in developing
our marketable product. 

 We specialize in software development for control
equipment and security systems, with a focus on enhancing navigation capabilities, optimizing patrol routes, and seamless integration
with existing surveillance systems. Our solutions can be integrated with established control equipment and security systems, or used as
independent versions. Our current projects involve software integration with security and video surveillance systems, along with the development
of customizable solutions that support long-distance navigation, and task completion. We also consider developing software solution that
enables autonomous charging and docking, allowing robots autonomously return to charging stations, as well as enhancing gesture and voice
recognition features. 

Software Description 

The software programs robotic units to follow specific
routes while recording current situation with built-in cameras and analyzing them. Our system allows for real-time image transmission
to the owner's device and features a GSM alarm function, enabling remote control over the internet to command the robot to respond to
triggered sensors. The robotic units' patrol routes dynamically adapt based on emerging alarm situations, ensuring swift response to potential
threats. The robotic units are able to detect security violations and send notifications or pursue trespassers in order to identify and
gather their parameters, which may then be used for law enforcement purposes. 

The software enables robotic units to operate both
indoors and outdoors on different surfaces. Such robotic units may be easily stored at any location when not needed. However, their main
focus is patrolling shopping centers, supermarkets, parking lots, large company offices, educational institutions, warehouses, private
property, and other locations. Depending on customers requirements, we are planning to install additional functions and tune the
standard ones. 

4 

Potential clients 

We plan to offer our product to owners of big spaces
such as parking lots, shopping malls, factories, corporate facilities, warehouses, restricted areas, private areas, airports, stations,
educational and state institutions. 

 Marketing 

 We believe that the key marketing strategy
for our type of business is online marketing. We plan to advertise our Company on the Internet via Google AdWords and Yahoo Ad Manager
technologies using several online marketing strategies to attract users to our promotional website. It is going to contain information
about the software we will develop, its applicable features, advantages, and contact information. Tofla is also going to create and maintain
profiles in social networking websites like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. 

 We intend to maintain an extensive marketing
campaign that will ensure maximum visibility for the business in its target market. We plan to sell our software through direct emails,
phone calls, business meetings and corporate presentations as well. Our sole officer and director, Rodolfo Guerrero Angulo, will be responsible
for marketing of our product. Even if we are able to obtain sufficient number of customers to buy our software, there is no guarantee
that it will cover our costs and that we will be able to retain enough customers to justify our expenditures. If we are unable to generate
a significant amount of revenue, it would materially affect our financial condition and our business could be harmed. We will rely heavily
on our clients recommending our technology to others in our target market. 

Competition 

The software development market is rapidly
growing day by day and there is a big number of companies operating in this domain. Our key feature is developing software for security
purposes, ranging from surveillance and transferring visual data to a remote server to pursuing potential trespassers. Entry level barriers
of the industry are relatively low and accessible, which leads to an extremely high level of competition. We believe there are not too
many developers of security software in Mexico and there is a niche to be occupied. We intend to focus and attend to individual needs
of each of our potential clients. 

 We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend
to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may
not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs, a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease
operations. 

Employees; Identification of Certain Significant
Employees. 

We are a development stage Company and currently have
1 (one) employee who is Rodolfo Guerrero Angulo, our sole officer and director. We may hire employees on an as needed basis following
the process of implementing our business plan.

We do not believe that regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business.

Revenue 

During the year ended July
31, 2023 and the year ended July 31, 2022, we generated 61,350 and 4,050 of revenue, respectively, due to the general growth of our

party loans, offset by 18,100 in repayments to related parties. During the year ended July 31, 2022 the Company generated 36,414 of
cash from financing activities as a result of proceeds from related party loans. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Use of Estimates 

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Revenue Recognition 

 The Company recognizes revenue in accordance
with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The core
principle of ASC 606 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an
amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. An entity
recognizes revenue in accordance with that core principle by applying the following steps: Step 1: Identify the contract with the
customer. Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract. Step 3: Determine the transaction price. Step 4. Allocate
the transaction price. Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. 

The Company generates revenue through the sale of
software and by providing consulting or technical support services. For the sale of software, revenue is recognized at the point in time
when the ownership of software (as approved by the customer) is transferred per the terms of a contract. The Company shall not be liable
for any failure to perform its obligations if such failure is due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control. Any liability of the
Company shall be limited to the total of all amounts paid by the customer for services under the contract. For consulting or technical
support services, revenue is recognized as the services are provided. 

The Company generally collects payment from customers
prior to transferring ownership of software or at the end of any service period and may require deposits from customers at the time an
order is placed. When deposits are collected prior to transferring ownership of software or before services are performed the Company
recognizes deferred revenue until the transfer is made or services are provided. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

The Company has reviewed all the recent accounting
pronouncements issued to date of the issuance of these financial statements, and does not believe any of these pronouncements will have
a material impact on the Company s financial reporting. 

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements including
arrangements that would affect our liquidity, capital resources, market risk support and credit risk support or other benefits.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 

Board of Directors and Shareholders 

 Tofla Megaline Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Tofla Megaline Inc.
as of July 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years
then ended and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tofla Megaline Inc. as of July 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended July 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the entity will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the entity has an accumulated deficit
and negative working capital and expects losses in the development of its business, all of which raise substantial doubt about its ability
to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the entity s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting
firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent
with respect to Tofla Megaline Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Tofla Megaline Inc. is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit
of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts
or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.
We determined that there are no critical audit matters. 

/s/ 

We have served as Tofla Megaline's auditor
since 2021.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting
and Financial Disclosure

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation
of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2023, using the criteria established in Internal
Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO - 2013 ). 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2023, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies
that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. 

1. We lack an adequate internal control
structure Due to the size of the Company we do not have the appropriate control activities, risk assessment procedures,
controls over information and communication, or effective monitoring controls. 

2. We do not have appropriate
segregation of duties or adequate accounting resources The Company has only one employee that does not have sufficient
accounting knowledge, experience, and understanding of US GAAP or SEC rules, therefore no expertise or reviews are in place to
ensure adequate financial reporting. Further, while not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the
management s view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over
the Company s financial statements. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not
include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management s
activities. 

22 

3. We do not have appropriate
information technology controls The Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however, there is
no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company s data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft,
misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors. Further there are no IT controls in place to prevent changes to, or
misstatement in, financial reporting. 

Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control
deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company s internal controls. 

As a result of the material weaknesses described above,
management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2023 based
on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO. 

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including
its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There has been no change in our internal control over
financial reporting occurred during the year ended July 31, 2023, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers, and Control Persons of the Company 

DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AND CONTROL PERSONS 

Our executive officer's and director's and their respective ages are as
follows: 

Name 
 Age 
 Positions 
 
 Rodolfo Guerrero Angulo 
 52 
 President, Treasurer, Secretary and Director (Principal Executive, Financial and Accounting Officer) 

Set forth below is a brief description of the background
and business experience of our executive officers and directors for the past five years. 

Rodolfo Guerrero Angulo 

Rodolfo Guerrero Angulo has acted as our President,
Treasurer, Secretary and sole Director since we incorporated on August 31, 2018. Mr. Angulo owns 100 of the outstanding shares of our
common stock. As such, it was unilaterally decided that Mr. Angulo was going to be our sole President, Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer,
and Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Secretary and sole member of our board of directors. Between 2011 and 2018, Mr.
Angulo worked as IT project manager in real estate sector for Afkal Develop (Leon, Mexico). Mr. Angulo s responsibilities included
managing the Company s projects and he was responsible for programming and extensions for project teams. In 2006, Mr. Angulo decided
to change his field of work and started working as a freelance IT manager for a small firm in Leon, Mexico, where he worked until 2011.
Between 1996 and 2005, Mr. Angulo worked in the area of car dealership called Leonveh ltd. in Leon, Mexico. Mr. Angulo studied at University
of Leon in Leon, Mexico from 1989 to 1995 and he did not graduate. Mr. Angulo prioritized experience in business over education. This
enabled him to obtain more experience sooner and start new business with additional knowledge. 

 During the past ten years, Mr. Angulo has not
been the subject to any of the following events: 

 1. Any bankruptcy petition filed by or against
any business of which Mr. Angulo was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior
to that time. 

 2. Any conviction in a criminal proceeding or
being subject to a pending criminal proceeding. 

 3. An order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently
reversed, suspended or vacated, or any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise
limiting Mr. Angulo s involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities. 

 4. Found by a court of competent jurisdiction
(in a civil action), the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Future Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state
securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended or vacated. 

 5. Was the subject of any order, judgment or
decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any Federal or State authority barring, suspending or otherwise limiting for
more than 60 days the right to engage in any activity described in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, or to be associated with persons
engaged in any such activity; 

24 

6. Was found by a court of competent jurisdiction
in a civil action or by the Commission to have violated any Federal or State securities law, and the judgment in such civil action or
finding by the Commission has not been subsequently reversed, suspended, or vacated; 

 7. Was the subject of, or a party to, any Federal
or State judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, relating to
an alleged violation of: 

 i. Any Federal or State securities or
commodities law or regulation; or 

 ii. Any law or regulation respecting financial
institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution,
civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order; or 

 iii. Any law or regulation prohibiting
mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or 

 8. Was the subject of, or a party to, any sanction
or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the
Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))),
or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated
with a member. 

DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 

Our Board of Directors is currently composed of one
member, Rodolfo Guerrero Angulo, who does not qualify as an independent director. Our board of directors has not made a subjective determination
as to each director that no relationships exist which, in the opinion of our board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of
independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Had our Board of Directors made these determinations, our board
of directors would have reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors and us with regard to each director s business
and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management. 

INVOLVEMENT IN CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

No director, executive officer, significant employee
or control person of the Company has been involved in any legal proceeding listed in Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K in the past 10 years. 

25 

AUDIT COMMITTEE, COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, AND FINANCIAL
EXPERT 

We do not have an Audit Committee or Compensation
Committee because the Company s sole employee is also the sole member of management and sole director. Additionally, we have no
persons currently receiving any compensation due to our start-up nature. Our sole director performs some of the same functions of an Audit
Committee and Compensation Committee, such as: recommending a firm of independent certified public accountants to audit the annual financial
statements; reviewing the independent auditor s independence, the financial statements, and their audit report; reviewing management s
administration of the system of internal accounting controls, and determining all compensation amounts. The Company does not currently
have a written audit committee charter or a compensation committee charter or any similar documents. 

We have no financial expert. We believe the cost related
to retaining a financial expert at this time is prohibitive. Further, because of our start-up operations, we believe the services of a
financial expert are not warranted. 

CODE OF ETHICS 

The Company has not adopted a formal written code
of ethics due to the small size of the organization and start-up nature, along with the fact that the Company s sole employee is
also the sole member of management and sole director.

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management
and Related Stockholder Matters 

The following table lists, as of the date of this
form 10-K, the number of shares of common stock of our Company that are beneficially owned by (i) each person or entity known to our Company
to be the beneficial owner of more than 5 of the outstanding common stock; (ii) each officer and director of our Company; and (iii) all
officers and directors as a group. Information relating to beneficial ownership of common stock by our principal shareholders and management
is based upon information furnished by each person using beneficial ownership concepts under the rules of the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Under these rules, a person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security if that person has or shares voting
power, which includes the power to vote or direct the voting of the security, or investment power, which includes the power to vote or
direct the voting of the security. The person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any security of which that person has a right
to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days. 

27 

Under the Securities and Exchange Commission rules,
more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities, and a person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner
of securities as to which he or she may not have any pecuniary beneficial interest. Except as noted below, each person has sole voting
and investment power. 

The percentages below are calculated based on 5,352,035
shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of the date of this Form 10-K. We do not have any outstanding warrant, options or
other securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of our common stock.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 

On May 20, 2021, we issued a total of 4,500,000
shares of common stock to Rodolfo Guerrero Angulo, our sole officer and director in consideration of 4,500. Further, effective August
31, 2018, Mr. Angulo formally agreed to advance funds to the Company to pay for professional fees and operating expenses under a 50,000
Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement is non-binding and discretionary, bears no interest, is unsecured, and is has no fixed due date, therefore
is considered due on demand. As of July 31, 2023, Mr. Angulo has advanced to us 44,285, of which 19,841 was advanced during the year
ended July 31, 2023 and 18,100 was repaid. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Mr. Angulo. Rodolfo Guerrero
Angulo will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate substantial revenues to pay the obligation. There is no assurance
that we will ever generate revenues from our operations. The obligation to Mr. Angulo does not bear interest. 

 On April 20, 2022, Mr. Angulo formally agreed to advance
additional funds to the Company to pay for professional fees and operating expenses under another 50,000 Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement
is non-binding and discretionary, bears no interest, is unsecured, and has no fixed due date, therefore it is considered due on demand.
As of July 31, 2023 no amounts are outstanding for this second Loan Agreement.
