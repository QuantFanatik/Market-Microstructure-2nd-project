 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) 

 Management uses NFE, a non-GAAP financial measure, when evaluating its operating results. NFE is a measure of the earnings based on eliminating timing differences surrounding the recognition of certain gains or losses to effectively match the earnings effects of the economic hedges with the physical sale of natural gas and, therefore, eliminates the impact of volatility to GAAP earnings associated with the derivative instruments. ES economically hedges its natural gas inventory with financial derivative instruments and calculates the related tax effect based on the statutory rate. NFE also excludes certain transactions associated with equity method investments, including impairment charges, which are non-cash charges, and return of capital in excess of the carrying value of our investment. These are considered unusual in nature and occur infrequently and are not indicative of the Company s performance for its ongoing operations. Included in the tax effects are current and deferred income tax expense corresponding with the components of NFE. 
 
 Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP, and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the comparable GAAP measure. The following is a reconciliation of consolidated net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to NFE for the fiscal years ended September 30:

 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) 

 Natural Gas Distribution 
 
 General 
 
 NJNG consists of regulated utility operations that provide natural gas service to approximately 576,000 customers. NJNG s service territory includes Burlington, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean and Sussex counties in New Jersey. It encompasses 1,516 square miles, covering 110 municipalities with an estimated population of 1.5 million people. It is primarily suburban, highlighted by approximately 100 miles of New Jersey coastline. It is in close proximity to New York City, Philadelphia and the metropolitan areas of northern New Jersey, and is accessible through a network of major roadways and mass transportation. 
 
 NJNG s business is subject to various risks, such as those associated with adverse economic conditions, which can negatively impact customer growth and operating and financing costs; fluctuations in commodity prices, which can impact customer usage; certain regulatory actions; and environmental remediation. It is often difficult to predict the impact of trends associated with these risks. NJNG employs strategies to pursue customer conversions from other fuel sources and monitor new construction markets through contact with developers, utilize incentive programs through BPU-approved mechanisms to reduce natural gas costs, pursue rate and other regulatory strategies designed to stabilize and decouple gross margin, and work actively with consultants and the NJDEP to manage expectations related to its obligations associated with its former MGP sites. 
 
 Operating Revenues/Throughput 
 
 For the fiscal years ended September 30, operating revenues and throughput by customer class for NJNG are as follows: 
 2023 2022 2021 in thousands) Operating Revenue Bcf Operating Revenue Bcf Operating Revenue Bcf Residential 643,756 43.4 598,433 45.5 484,407 46.2 Commercial and other 137,343 8.4 140,727 8.7 103,341 8.6 Firm transportation 79,537 12.1 80,915 13.0 69,353 13.7 Total residential and commercial 860,636 63.9 820,075 67.2 657,101 68.5 Interruptible/off-tariff agreements/other 9,996 29.5 9,740 32.4 7,239 22.9 Total system 870,632 93.4 829,815 99.6 664,340 91.4 BGSS incentive programs (1)

 (1) Does not include 37.7, 50.7 and 80.5 Bcf for the capacity release program and related amounts of approximately 0.9M, 0.7M and 3.1M, which are recorded as a reduction of natural gas purchases on the Consolidated Statements of Operations during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 NJNG added 8,800 and 7,808 new customers during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. NJNG expects its annual customer growth rate to be approximately 1.9 . This anticipated customer growth represents approximately 8.5M in new annual Utility Gross Margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, as calculated under NJNG s current CIP tariff. For a reconciliation of Utility Gross Margin to gross margin see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Natural Gas Distribution . 
 
 In fiscal 2023, no single customer represented more than 10 of consolidated operating revenues. 
 
 Seasonality of Natural Gas Revenues 
 
 Therm sales are significantly affected by weather conditions, with customer demand being greatest during the winter months when natural gas is used for heating purposes. The relative measurement of the impact of weather is in Degree-days. Degree-day data is used to estimate amounts of energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperature levels based on each day s average temperature. Each degree of temperature below 65 degrees Fahrenheit is counted as one heating Degree-day. Normal heating Degree-days are based on a 20-year average, calculated based on three reference areas representative of NJNG s service territory. 
 
 CIP, a mechanism authorized by the BPU, stabilizes NJNG s Utility Gross Margin, regardless of variations in weather. In addition, CIP decouples the link between Utility Gross Margin and customer usage, allowing NJNG to promote energy conservation measures. Recovery of Utility Gross Margin is subject to additional conditions, including an earnings test, a revenue test and an evaluation of BGSS-related savings achieved over a 12-month period. The BPU approved the continuation of the CIP program with no expiration date.

 In fiscal 2023, NJNG purchased natural gas from approximately 58 suppliers under contracts ranging from one day to seven months and purchased over 10 of its natural gas from two suppliers. NJNG believes the loss of either of these suppliers would not have a material adverse impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows, as an adequate number of alternative suppliers exist. NJNG believes that its supply strategy should adequately meet its expected firm load for the upcoming winter season. 
 
 Firm Transportation and Storage Capacity 
 
 NJNG maintains agreements for firm transportation and storage capacity with several interstate pipeline companies to take delivery of firm natural gas supplies, which ensures the ability to reliably service its customers. NJNG receives natural gas at 11 citygate stations located in Burlington, Middlesex, Morris and Passaic counties in New Jersey. 
 
 The pipeline companies that provide firm transportation service to NJNG s citygate stations, the maximum daily deliverability of that capacity and the contract expiration dates are as follows: 
 Pipeline Dths (1) 
 Expiration Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. 332,531 Various dates between 2024 and 2033 Texas Eastern Transmission, L.P. 383,588 Various dates between 2024 and 2025 Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. 50,000 Various dates between 2024 and 2030 Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. 25,166 Various dates between 2028 and 2029 Algonquin Gas Transmission 12,000 2025 Total 803,285 
 (1) Numbers are shown net of any capacity release contracted amounts. 
 
 Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage, Inc., Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. and Adelphia provide NJNG upstream firm contract transportation service and supply pipelines included in the table above. 
 
 In addition, NJNG has storage contracts that provide an additional 102,941 Dths of maximum daily deliverability to NJNG s citygate stations from storage fields in its Northeast market area. The storage suppliers, the maximum daily deliverability of that storage capacity and the contract expiration dates are as follows: 
 Pipeline Dths Expiration Texas Eastern Transmission, L.P. 94,557 2025 Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. 8,384 2028 Total 102,941 
 
 NJNG also has upstream storage contracts. The maximum daily deliverability and contract expiration dates are as follows: 
 Company Dths Expiration Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage 286,829 Various dates between 2024 and 2026 Steckman Ridge, L.P. 38,000 2025 Stagecoach Pipeline Storage Company LLC 25,337 2028 Total 350,166 
 
 NJNG utilizes its transportation contracts to transport natural gas to NJNG s citygates from the Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage, Inc., Steckman Ridge and Stagecoach Pipeline Storage Company LLC storage fields. NJNG has sufficient firm transportation, storage and supply capacity to fully meet its customer demand for natural gas within its service territory. 
 
 Citygate Supplies from ES 
 
 NJNG has one AMA with ES. NJNG and ES have an agreement where NJNG releases 7,150 Dths/day of TETCO capacity, 2,200 Dths/day of Eastern Gas Transmission and Storage, Inc. capacity, 10,728 Dths/day of Tennessee Gas Pipeline

 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) 

 capacity and 1.6 million Dths of Stagecoach Pipeline Storage Company LLC storage capacity to ES through March 31, 2024. NJNG can call upon a supply of up to 14,300 Dths/day delivered to NJNG s TETCO citygate through March 31, 2024. ES manages the storage inventory and NJNG can call on that storage supply as needed at NJNG s Tennessee citygate or storage point. 
 
 Peaking Supply 
 
 To manage its winter peak day demand, NJNG maintains two LNG facilities with a combined deliverability of approximately 170,000 Dths/day, which represents approximately 18 of its estimated peak day sendout. NJNG s liquefaction facility allows NJNG to convert natural gas into LNG to fill NJNG s existing LNG storage tanks. See Item 2. Properties-Natural Gas Distribution for additional information regarding the LNG storage facilities. 
 
 Basic Gas Supply Service 
 
 BGSS is a BPU-approved clause designed to allow for the recovery of natural gas commodity costs on an annual basis. The clause requires all New Jersey natural gas utilities to make an annual filing by each June 1 for review of BGSS rates and to request a potential rate change effective the following October 1. The BGSS also allows each natural gas utility to provisionally increase residential and small commercial customer BGSS rates on December 1 and February 1 for up to a 5 increase to the average residential heat customer s bill on a self-implementing basis with proper notice. Such increases are subject to subsequent BPU review and final approval. 
 
 In addition to making periodic rate adjustments to reflect changes in commodity prices, NJNG is also permitted to refund or credit back a portion of the commodity costs to customers when the natural gas commodity costs decrease in comparison to amounts projected or to amounts previously collected from customers. Decreases in the BGSS rate and BGSS refunds can be implemented with five days notice to the BPU. Rate changes, as well as other regulatory actions related to BGSS, are discussed further in Note 4. Regulation in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Wholesale natural gas prices are, by their nature, volatile. NJNG mitigates the impact of volatile price changes on customers through the use of financial derivative instruments, which are part of its storage incentive program and its BGSS clause. 
 
 Future Natural Gas Supplies 
 
 NJNG expects to meet the natural gas requirements for existing and projected firm customers. If NJNG s long-term natural gas requirements change, NJNG expects to renegotiate and restructure its contract portfolio to better match the changing needs of its customers and changing natural gas supply landscape. 
 
 Regulation and Rates 
 
 State 
 
 NJNG is subject to the jurisdiction of the BPU with respect to a wide range of matters such as base rates and regulatory rider rates, the issuance of securities, the safety and adequacy of service, the manner of keeping its accounts and records, the sufficiency of natural gas supply, pipeline safety, environmental issues, compliance with affiliate standards and the sale or encumbrance of its properties. See Note 4. Regulation in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding NJNG s rate proceedings. 
 
 Federal 
 
 FERC regulates rates charged by interstate pipeline companies for the transportation and storage of natural gas. This may affect NJNG s agreements with several interstate pipeline companies for the purchase of such services. Costs associated with these services are currently recoverable through the BGSS. 
 
 Competition 
 
 Although its franchises are nonexclusive, NJNG is not currently subject to competition from other natural gas distribution utilities with regard to the transportation of natural gas in its service territory. Due to significant distances between NJNG s current large industrial customers and the nearest interstate natural gas pipelines, as well as the availability of its transportation tariff, NJNG currently does not believe it has significant exposure to the risk that its distribution system will be bypassed. Competition does exist from suppliers of oil, electricity and propane. At the present time, however, natural gas is used in over 95 of new construction due to its efficiency, reliability and price advantage. Natural gas prices are a function of market supply and demand. Although NJNG believes natural gas will remain competitive with alternate fuels, no assurance can be given in this regard.

 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) 

 The BPU, within the framework of the EDECA, fully opened NJNG s residential markets to competition, including third-party suppliers, and restructured rates to segregate its BGSS and delivery (i.e., transportation) prices. New Jersey s natural gas utilities must provide BGSS in the absence of a third-party supplier. On September 30, 2023, NJNG had 15,457 residential and 8,033 commercial and industrial customers utilizing the transportation service. 

Clean Energy Ventures 
 
 CEV invests in, owns and operates clean energy projects, including commercial and residential solar installations located in six states including New Jersey, Rhode Island, New York, Connecticut, Michigan and Indiana. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, CEV has approximately 468.8 MW of solar capacity in service, including a combination of residential and commercial net-metered and grid-connected solar systems. 
 
 As part of its solar investment portfolio, CEV operates a residential and small commercial solar program, The Sunlight Advantage , that provides qualifying homeowners and small business owners with the opportunity to have a solar system installed at their home or place of business with no installation or maintenance expenses. CEV owns, operates and maintains the system over the life of the lease in exchange for monthly lease payments. The program is operated by CEV using qualified contracting partners in addition to strategic suppliers for material standardization and sourcing. The residential solar lease and PPA market is highly competitive, with a large number of companies operating in New Jersey. CEV competes on price, quality and brand reputation, leveraging its partner network and customer referrals. 
 
 CEV s commercial solar projects are sourced through various channels and include both net-metered and grid-connected systems. Net-metered projects involve the sale of energy to a host and grid-connected systems into the wholesale energy markets. Project construction is competitively sourced through third parties. New Jersey has the eighth largest solar market in the U.S., according to the Solar Energy Industries Association , with a large number of firms competing in all facets of the market including development, financing and construction. 
 
 Our solar systems are registered and certified with the BPU s Office of Clean Energy and qualified to produce RECs. One REC is created for every MWh of electricity produced by a solar generator. CEV sells SRECs generated to a variety of counterparties, including electric load-serving entities that serve electric customers in New Jersey and are required to comply with the solar carve-out of the Renewable Portfolio Standard, a regulation that requires the increased production of energy from renewable energy sources. Solar projects are also currently eligible for federal ITCs in the year that they are placed into service. In December 2019, the BPU established the TREC as the interim program successor to the SREC program. TRECs provide a fixed compensation base multiplied by an assigned project factor in order to determine their value. The project factor is determined by the type and location of the project, as defined. All TRECs generated are required to be purchased monthly by a TREC program administrator as appointed by the BPU. 
 
 In July 2021, the BPU approved the first portion of the solar successor program for net-metered projects under 5 MWs. The new program opened to new applications on August 28, 2021. Incentives are structured as a 15-year fixed incentive ranging from 85 to 130/MWh depending on market segment, project siting and size. The second phase of the successor program, the CSI Program, was established on December 7, 2022. The CSI program was designed to encourage grid scale solar generation with a goal of incentivizing development of at least 300 MW of solar annually until 2026. Solicitations take place annually, and all projects that meet pre-qualification requirements will compete on price only. The next solicitation will open on November 27, 2023, and will close to bids on February 29, 2024. 
 
 CEV is subject to various risks including those associated with adverse federal and state legislation and regulatory policies, electric grid connection, supply chain and/or construction delays that can impact the timing or eligibility of tax incentives, technological changes and the future market of RECs. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information regarding these risks. 

Energy Services 
 
 ES consists of unregulated wholesale and retail natural gas operations and provides producer and asset management services to a diverse customer base across North America. ES has acquired contractual rights to natural gas transportation and storage assets it utilizes to implement its strategic and opportunistic market strategies. The rights to these assets were acquired in anticipation of delivering natural gas, performing asset management services for customers or identifying strategic opportunities that exist in or between the market areas that it serves. These opportunities are driven by price differentials between market locations and/or time periods. ES s activities are conducted in the market areas in which it has strong expertise, including the U.S. and Canada. ES differentiates itself in the marketplace based on price, reliability and quality of service. Its competitors include wholesale marketing and trading companies, utilities, natural gas producers and financial institutions. ES s portfolio of customers includes regulated natural gas distribution companies, industrial companies, electric generators, natural gas/liquids processors, retail aggregators, wholesale marketers and natural gas producers.

 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) 

 While focusing on maintaining a low-risk operating and counterparty credit profile, ES s activities specifically consist of the following elements: 
 
 Providing natural gas portfolio management services to nonaffiliated and our affiliated natural gas utility, electric generation facilities and natural gas producers; 
 
 Managing strategies for new and existing natural gas transportation and storage assets to capture value from changes in price due to location or timing differences as a means to generate Financial Margin; 
 
 Managing transactional logistics to minimize the cost of natural gas delivery to customers while maintaining security of supply. Transactions utilize the most optimal and advantageous natural gas supply transportation routing available within its contractual asset portfolio and various market areas; and 
 
 Managing economic hedging programs that are designed to mitigate the impact of changes in market prices on Financial Margin generated on its natural gas transportation and storage commitments. 
 
 In an effort to deliver more predictable earnings contributions, reduce earnings volatility and monetize the value of its natural gas transportation portfolio, ES entered into a series of AMAs in December 2020 with an investment grade public utility to release pipeline capacity associated with certain natural gas transportation contracts. The AMAs include a series of initial and permanent releases, which commenced in November 2021. NJR will receive a total of approximately 260M in cash from fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2024 and 34M per year from fiscal 2025 through fiscal 2031 under the agreements. 
 
 During fiscal 2023, ES did not purchase over 10 of its natural gas from any one supplier. 
 
 Transportation and Natural Gas Storage Transactions 
 
 ES focuses on creating value from the use of its physical assets, which are typically amassed through contractual rights to natural gas transportation and storage capacity. These assets become more valuable when favorable price changes occur that impact the value between or within market areas and across time periods. On a forward basis, ES may hedge these price differentials through the use of financial instruments. In addition, ES may seek to optimize these assets on a daily basis, as market conditions warrant, by evaluating natural gas supply and transportation availability within its portfolio. This enables ES to capture geographic pricing differences across various regions, as delivered natural gas prices may change favorably as a result of market conditions. ES may, for example, initiate positions when intrinsic Financial Margin is present, and then enhance that Financial Margin as prices change across regions or time periods. 
 
 ES also engages in park and loan transactions with storage and pipeline operators, where ES will either borrow (receive a loan of) natural gas with an obligation to repay the storage or pipeline operator at a later date or park natural gas with an obligation to withdraw at a later date. In these cases, ES evaluates the economics of the transaction to determine if it can capture pricing differentials in the marketplace and generate Financial Margin. ES evaluates deal attributes such as fixed fees and calendar-spread value from deal inception until volumes are scheduled to be returned and/or repaid, as well as the time value of money. If this evaluation demonstrates that Financial Margin exists, ES may enter into the transaction and hedge with natural gas futures contracts, thereby locking in Financial Margin. 
 
 ES maintains inventory balances to satisfy existing or anticipated sales of natural gas to its counterparties and/or to create additional value, as described above. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, ES managed and sold 150.4 Bcf and 231.1 Bcf of natural gas, respectively. In addition, as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, ES had 14.6 Bcf or 24.5M of natural gas in storage and 10.8 Bcf or 82.5M of natural gas in storage, respectively. 
 
 Weather/Seasonality 
 
 ES activities are typically seasonal in nature as a result of changes in the supply and demand for natural gas. Demand for natural gas is generally higher during the winter months when there may also be supply constraints; however, during periods of milder temperatures, demand can decrease. In addition, demand for natural gas can also be high during periods of extreme heat in the summer months, resulting from the need for additional natural gas supply for natural gas-fired electric generation facilities. Accordingly, ES can be subject to variations in earnings and working capital throughout the year as a result of changes in weather.

 ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) 

 Volatility 
 
 ES s activities are also subject to price volatility or supply/demand dynamics within its North American wholesale markets, including in the Northeastern, Appalachian, Mid-Continent and Southeast regions. Changes in natural gas supply can affect capacity values and ES s Financial Margin, which, as described below, is generated from the optimization of transportation and storage assets. With its focus on risk management, ES continues to diversify its revenue stream by identifying new growth opportunities in producer and asset management services. ES monitors changing market dynamics and strategically adjusts its portfolio of transportation and storage assets, which currently includes an average of approximately 21.8 Bcf of firm storage and 0.6 Bcf of firm transportation capacity. 
 
 Financial Margin 
 
 To economically hedge the commodity price risk associated with its existing and anticipated commitments for the purchase and sale of natural gas, ES enters into a variety of derivative instruments including, but not limited to, futures contracts, physical forward contracts, financial swaps and options. These derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings as they occur. ES views Financial Margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a key internal financial metric. For additional information regarding Financial Margin, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Energy Services . 
 
 Risk Management 
 
 In conducting its business, ES mitigates risk by following formal risk management guidelines, including transaction limits, segregation of duties and formal contract and credit review approval processes. ES continuously monitors and seeks to reduce the risk associated with its counterparty credit exposures. Our Risk Management Committee oversees compliance with these established guidelines. 

Storage and Transportation

 ENVIRONMENT 
 
 We, along with our subsidiaries, are subject to legislation and regulation by federal, state and local authorities with respect to environmental matters. We believe that we are, in all material respects, in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. 
 
 NJNG is responsible for the environmental remediation of identified former MGP sites, which contain contaminated residues from former gas manufacturing operations that ceased at these sites by the mid-1950s and, in some cases, had been discontinued many years earlier. NJNG periodically, and at least annually, performs an environmental review of the former MGP sites, including a review of potential estimated liabilities related to the investigation and remedial action on these sites. Based on this review, NJNG has estimated that the total future expenditures to remediate and monitor the former MGP sites for which it is responsible will range from approximately 137.3M to 201.5M. 
 
 NJNG s estimate of these liabilities is based upon known and measurable facts, existing technology and enacted laws and regulations in place when the review was completed in fiscal 2023. Where it is probable that costs will be incurred, and the information is sufficient to establish a range of possible liability, NJNG accrues the most likely amount in the range. If no point within the range is more likely than the other, it is NJNG s policy to accrue the lower end of the range. As of September 30, 2023, NJNG recorded an MGP remediation liability and a corresponding regulatory asset of 169.4M on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, based on the most likely amount; however, actual costs may differ from these estimates. 
 
 HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Employee Overview 
 
 NJR fundamentally believes that its employees make the Company a unique, successful organization in creativity, commitment, ingenuity, hard work and innovation. NJR employees fulfill the responsibilities that enable the Company to deliver natural gas service to its customers; to be a leader in clean energy investments; to grow its storage and transportation energy business; and to earn the loyalty of its retail home services customers. NJR also is committed to provide every appropriate resource to ensure its employees safety. Through initiatives that start at the top, NJR has invested time, energy and manpower to foster a culture where safety is top-of-mind at all times, and where achieving safety goals is a shared priority for every NJR employee. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, the Company and our subsidiaries employed 1,350 employees compared with 1,288 employees as of September 30, 2022. Of the total number of employees, NJNG had 509 and 498 and NJRHS had 117 and 113 Union or Represented employees as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. NJNG and NJRHS have collective bargaining agreements with the Union, which is affiliated with the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. NJNG and the Union are in active negotiations to extend the collective bargaining agreement, which is scheduled to expire on December 7, 2023. The collective bargaining agreement between NJRHS and the Union is scheduled to expire April 2, 2024. The labor agreements cover wage increases and other benefits, including the defined benefit pension (which was closed to all employees hired on or after January 1, 2012, with the exception of certain rehires who are eligible to resume active participation), the postemployment benefit plan (which was closed to all employees hired on or after January 1, 2012) and the enhanced 401(k) retirement savings plan. We consider our relationship with employees, including those covered by collective bargaining agreements, to be in good standing. 
 
 The Company depends on its key personnel to successfully operate its businesses, including its executive officers, senior corporate management and management at its operating units. NJR seeks to attract and retain its employees by offering competitive compensation packages including base and incentive compensation (and in certain instances share-based compensation and retention incentives), attractive benefits and opportunities for advancement and rewarding careers. NJR periodically reviews and adjusts, if needed, its employees total compensation (including salaries, annual cash incentive compensation, other cash and equity incentives and benefits) to ensure that it is competitive within the industry and is consistent with our level of performance. NJR has also implemented enterprise-wide talent development and succession planning programs designed to identify future talent for key positions. To promote a collaborative and rewarding work environment and support the communities we serve, NJR sponsors numerous charitable, philanthropic and social awareness programs. 
 
 Further, in order to take advantage of available opportunities and successfully implement our long-term strategy, NJR must be able to employ, train and retain the necessary skilled employees. As a result, NJR supports and utilizes various training and educational programs and has developed additional company-wide and project-specific employee training and educational programs. NJR continues key programs focused on employee safety, leadership development, work-life balance, talent management, health and wellness, DEI and employee engagement. Moreover, DEI and employee engagement are integral to NJR s vision, strategy and business success. Fostering an environment that values DEI and ethics helps create an organization

 that is able to embrace, leverage and respect the differences of employees, customers and the communities where we live, work and serve. We are proud of the strides we have made in furthering our DEI strategy and increasing employee engagement. NJR is committed to this journey and knows our success makes us stronger as a company and community. Complementing our efforts are a DEI Council and our seven employee-led Business Resource Groups, cross-functional teams of employees whose core mission is to advance their own professional development and cultivate deeper connections with co-workers and communities. 
 
 NJR periodically evaluates employees and their productivity against future demand expectations and historical trends. NJR employees continue to maintain high levels of engagement, satisfaction and retention according to NJR s most recent employee survey. 
 
 NJR Board of Directors Role in Human Capital Resource Management 
 
 NJR s Board of Directors believes that human capital management is an important component of the Company s continued growth and success, and is essential for our ability to attract, retain and develop talented and skilled employees. We pride ourselves on a culture that is innovative, talent- and team-focused and inclusive. 
 
 Management regularly reports to the LDCC of the Board of Directors on human capital management topics, including corporate culture, DEI, employee development, compensation and benefits. The LDCC maintains oversight of matters related to human capital management, including talent retention, development and succession planning, and the Board of Directors provides input on important decisions in each of these areas. 
 
 NJR conducts an annual employee feedback survey, which is reviewed by the LDCC, designed to help the Company measure overall employee engagement. The feedback employees provide through the survey helps NJR evaluate the Company s culture and the employee experience and monitor its current practices for potential areas of improvement. 
 
 Employee Benefits 
 
 The LDCC believes employee benefits are an essential component of the Company s competitive total rewards package. These benefits are designed to attract and retain our employees and include medical, vision and dental insurance, short- and long-term disability insurance, accidental death and disability insurance, travel and accident insurance and our 401(k) Plan. As part of the 401(k) Plan, NJR matches 85 of the first 6 of compensation contributed by the employee into the 401(k) Plan, subject to the Internal Revenue Code and NJR s 401(k) Plan limits. Additionally, for employees who are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit plans, NJR annually contributes between 3.5 and 4.5 of base compensation, depending upon years of service, into the 401(k) Plan on their behalf.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 When considering any investment in our securities, investors should consider the following risk factors, as well as the information contained under the caption Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements, in analyzing our present and future business performance. While this list is not exhaustive, management also places no priority or likelihood based on their descriptions or order of presentation. Listed below, not necessarily in order of importance or probability of occurrence, are the most significant risk factors applicable to us. Unless indicated otherwise or the content requires otherwise, references below to we, us, and our should be read to refer to the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Business Operations 
 
 Our investments in solar energy projects are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. Our investments in commercial and residential solar energy projects are dependent, in part, upon current state regulatory incentives and federal tax credits in order for the projects to be economically viable. Our return on investment for these solar projects is based substantially on our eligibility for ITCs and the future market value of SRECs that are traded in a competitive marketplace in the State of New Jersey. These projects face the risk that the current state regulatory programs and tax laws may expire or be adversely modified. A sustained decrease in the value of SRECs could negatively impact the return on our investments and could impair our portfolio of solar assets. 
 
 In addition, there are risks associated with our ability to execute on our investment strategy of clean energy projects, which includes our ability to develop and manage such projects profitably. These include logistical risks and potential delays related to construction, permitting and regulatory approvals (including any approvals by the BPU required pursuant to solar energy legislation in the State of New Jersey, and similar approvals required by the other states where our solar projects are located); electric grid interconnection delays associated with the PJM Interconnection, LLC queue reform process; and the operational risk that the projects in service will not perform according to expectations due to equipment failure, suboptimal weather conditions or other economic factors beyond our control. All of the aforementioned risks could reduce the availability of viable solar energy projects for development. Furthermore, at the development or acquisition stage, our ability to predict actual performance results may be hindered or inaccurate and the projects may not perform as predicted.

 Actions or limitations to address concerns over long-term climate change, both globally and within our utilities' service areas, may affect our operations and financial performance. Legislative, regulatory and advocacy efforts at the local, state and national levels concerning climate change and other environmental issues could have significant impacts on our operations. The natural gas utility industry may be affected by proposals to curb greenhouse gas and other air emissions. Various regulatory and legislative proposals have been made to limit or further restrict byproducts of combustion, including byproducts resulting from the use of natural gas by our customers. In addition, regionally, a number of regulatory and legislative initiatives have been passed that are designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions and increase the use of renewable sources of energy, such as the ban of natural gas equipment in new construction in New York. In addition, regulatory and legislative initiatives may restrict customers access to natural gas and/or require or limit natural gas infrastructure in buildings. Other initiatives may seek to promote social interests expressed as energy equity, environmental justice or similar frameworks. Any such legislation could direct and/or restrict the operation and raise the costs of our energy delivery infrastructure as well as the distribution of natural gas to our customers. 
 
 Uncertainties associated with our pipeline of projects could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Business development projects involve many risks. We are currently engaged in business development projects, including projects in various stages of development tied to decarbonization efforts. Timely completion of our projects is subject to certain risks, including those related to regulatory proceedings regarding permitting and adverse outcomes from legal challenges related to the projects authorizations from federal and state regulatory agencies. We could also experience issues such as: technological challenges; ineffective scalability; failure to achieve expected outcomes; unsuccessful business models; startup and construction delays; construction cost overruns; disputes with contractors; the inability to negotiate acceptable agreements such as rights-of-way, easements, construction, gas supply or other material contracts; changes in customer demand, perception or commitment; public opposition to projects; marketing risk and changes in market regulation, behavior or prices; market volatility or unavailability, including markets for RNG and its associated attributes or other environmental attributes; the inability to receive expected tax or regulatory treatment; and operating cost increases. Additionally, we may be unable to finance our business development projects at acceptable costs or within a scheduled time frame necessary for completing the project. Any of the foregoing risks, if realized, could result in business development efforts failing to produce expected financial results and the project investment becoming impaired, and such failure or impairment could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 
 ES s earnings and cash flows are dependent upon optimization of its physical assets. ES s earnings and cash flows are based, in part, on its ability to optimize its portfolio of contractually based natural gas storage and pipeline assets. The optimization strategy involves utilizing its physical assets to take advantage of differences in natural gas prices between geographic locations and/or time periods. Any change among various pricing points could affect these differentials. In addition, significant increases in the supply of natural gas in ES s market areas, including as a result of increased production along the Marcellus Shale, can reduce ES s ability to take advantage of pricing fluctuations in the future. Changes in pricing dynamics and supply could have an adverse impact on ES s optimization activities, earnings and cash flows. ES incurs fixed demand fees to acquire its contractual rights to transportation and storage assets. Should commodity prices at various locations or time periods change in such a way that ES is not able to recoup these costs from its customers, the cash flows and earnings at ES, and ultimately the Company, could be adversely impacted. 
 
 NJNG and ES rely on storage, transportation assets and suppliers, which they do not own or control, to deliver natural gas. NJNG and ES depend on natural gas pipelines and other transportation and storage facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver natural gas to wholesale and retail markets and to provide retail energy services to customers. Their ability to provide natural gas for their present and projected sales will depend upon their suppliers ability to obtain and deliver additional supplies of natural gas, as well as NJNG s ability to acquire supplies directly from new sources. Factors beyond the control of NJNG, its suppliers and the independent suppliers that have obligations to provide natural gas to certain NJNG customers may affect NJNG s ability to deliver such supplies. These factors include other parties control over the drilling of new wells and the facilities to transport natural gas to NJNG s citygate stations; development of additional interstate pipeline infrastructure; availability of supply sources; third-party pipelines or other midstream facilities interconnected to our gathering or transportation system, such as the TETCO or Transcontinental Pipeline, becoming partially or fully unavailable; competition for the acquisition of natural gas; priority allocations; impact of severe weather disruptions to natural gas supplies; and the regulatory and pricing policies of federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as the availability of Canadian reserves for export to the U.S. Energy deregulation legislation may increase competition among natural gas utilities and impact the quantities of natural gas requirements needed for sales service. ES also relies on a firm supply source to meet its energy management obligations to its customers. If supply, transportation or storage is disrupted, including for reasons of force majeure, the ability of NJNG and ES to sell and deliver their products and services may be hindered. As a result, they may be responsible for damages incurred by their customers, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at then-current

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) 

 market rates. Particularly for ES, these conditions could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified employee workforce could adversely affect operations. Our ability to implement our business strategy and serve our customers is dependent upon our continuing ability to attract and retain talented professionals and a technically skilled workforce, and being able to transfer the knowledge and expertise of our workforce to new employees as our aging employees retire. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor could adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business. NJNG and the Union are in active negotiations to extend the collective bargaining agreement, which is scheduled to expire on December 7, 2023. The collective bargaining agreement between NJRHS and the Union is scheduled to expire April 2, 2024. Disputes with the Union over terms and conditions of the agreements could result in instability in our labor relationship and work stoppages that could impair the timely delivery of natural gas and other services from our utility and Home Services business, which could strain relationships with customers and state regulators and cause a loss of revenues that could adversely affect our results of operations. Our collective bargaining agreements may also increase the cost of employing NJNG and Home Services workforce, affect our ability to continue offering market-based salaries and employee benefits, limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce and limit our ability to change work rules and practices and implement other efficiency-related improvements to successfully compete in today s challenging marketplace. 
 
 Our success depends upon our ability to attract, effectively transition, motivate and retain key employees and identify and develop talent to succeed senior management. We depend on senior executive officers and other key personnel to develop, implement and execute on our overall business strategy. The inability to recruit and retain or effectively transition key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. 
 
 We may be unable to obtain governmental approvals, property rights and/or financing for the construction, development and operation of our proposed energy investments and projects in a timely manner or at all. Construction, development and operation of energy investments, such as Leaf River and other natural gas storage facilities, NJNG infrastructure improvements, pipeline transportation systems, such as the Adelphia pipeline project, and solar energy projects, are subject to federal and state regulatory oversight and require certain property rights, such as easements and rights-of-way from public and private property owners, as well as regulatory approvals, including environmental and other permits and licenses for such facilities and systems. We or our joint venture partnerships may be unable to obtain, in a cost-efficient or timely manner, all such needed property rights, permits and licenses to construct and develop our energy facilities and systems. Successful financing of our energy investments requires participation by willing financial institutions and lenders, as well as acquisition of capital at reasonable interest rates. If we do not obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or property rights, or if we are unable to enter into contracts with counterparties at reasonable rates, or obtain financing, our assets or equity method investments could be impaired. Such impairment could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Weather and weather patterns, including normal seasonal and quarterly fluctuations of weather, as well as extreme weather events that, individually or in aggregate, may be associated with climate change, could adversely affect our ability to manage our operational requirements to serve our customers, and ultimately adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. NJNG s business is seasonal, and weather patterns can have a material impact on our financial performance. Demand for natural gas is often greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating. Because natural gas is heavily used for residential and commercial heating, the demand for this product depends heavily upon weather patterns throughout our market areas, and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and second quarters related to the heating season. Accordingly, our operations have historically generated less revenue and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer. Unusually mild winters or cool summers could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. In addition, exceptionally hot summer weather or unusually cold winter weather could add significantly to working capital needs to fund higher than normal supply purchases to meet customer demand for natural gas. While we believe the CIP mitigates the impact of weather variations on NJNG s Utility Gross Margin, severe weather conditions may have an impact on the ability of suppliers and pipelines to deliver the natural gas to NJNG, which can negatively affect our earnings. The CIP does not mitigate the impact of severe weather conditions on our cash flows. 
 
 Future results at ES are subject to volatility in the natural gas market due to weather. Variations in weather may affect earnings and working capital needs throughout the year. During periods of milder temperatures, demand and volatility in the natural gas market may decrease, which can negatively impact ES s earnings and cash flows.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) 

 Severe weather impacts, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, thunderstorms, high winds, microbursts, fires, tornadoes, blizzards and snow or ice storms, can disrupt energy generation, transmission and distribution. Extreme weather conditions, especially those of prolonged duration, create high energy demand on our own and/or other systems and increase the risk that we may be unable to reliably serve customers. Risk of losing gas supply during extreme weather carries significant consequences, as without our services our customers may be subjected to dire circumstances. Additionally, extreme weather conditions may cause the breakdown of or damage to equipment essential to the operation of our assets, and could also raise market prices as we buy short-term energy to serve our own system. To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase our cost of providing service. In addition, we may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks. 
 
 There is also a concern that the physical risks of climate change could include changes in weather conditions, such as changes in the amount or type of precipitation and extreme weather events. Climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts have the potential to affect our business in many ways, including increasing the cost incurred in providing natural gas, impacting the demand for and consumption of natural gas (due to change in both costs and weather patterns) and affecting the economic health of the regions in which we operate. 
 
 We may be adversely impacted by natural disasters, pandemic illness, war or terrorist activities and other extreme events to which we may be unable to promptly respond. Local or national natural disasters, pandemic illness, actual or threatened acts of war or terrorist activities, including the political and economic disruption and uncertainty related to Russia s military invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, catastrophic failure of the interstate pipeline system and other extreme events are a threat to our assets and operations. Companies in our industry that are located in our service territory may face a heightened risk due to exposure to acts of terrorism that could target or impact our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage facilities and disrupt our operations and ability to meet customer requirements. In addition, the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations. Natural disasters, political unrest or actual or threatened terrorist activities may also disrupt capital markets and our ability to raise capital or may impact our suppliers or our customers directly. 
 
 A local disaster or pandemic illness could result in part of our workforce being unable to operate or maintain our infrastructure or perform other tasks necessary to conduct our business. In addition, these risks could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental damage, impairment of our operations and substantial loss to the Company. Such uncertain conditions may also impact the ability of certain customers to pay for services, which could affect the collectability and recognition of our revenues and adversely affect our financial results. Our regulators may not allow us to recover from our customers part or all of the increased cost related to the foregoing events, which could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 A slow or inadequate response to events that could cause business interruption may have an adverse impact on operations and earnings. We may be unable to obtain sufficient insurance (or such insurance may be costly) to cover all risks associated with local and national disasters, pandemic illness, terrorist activities, catastrophic failure of the interstate pipeline system and other events, which could increase the risk that an event adversely affects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Risks Related to Technologies 
 
 Cyberattacks, ransomware, terrorism, other malicious acts against, or failure of, information technology systems could adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. We continue to place ever-greater reliance on technological tools that support our business operations and corporate functions, including tools that help us manage our natural gas distribution and energy trading operations and infrastructure. The failure of, or security breaches related to, these technologies could materially adversely affect our business operations, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 We rely on information technology to manage our natural gas distribution and storage, energy trading and other corporate operations; maintain customer, employee, Company and vendor data; and prepare our financial statements and perform other critical business processes. This technology may fail due to cyberattack, physical disruption, design and implementation defects or human error. Disruption or failure of business operations and information technology systems could harm our facilities or otherwise adversely impact our ability to safely deliver natural gas to our customers, serve our customers effectively or manage our assets. Additionally, an attack on, or failure of, information technology systems could result in the unauthorized release of customer, employee or other confidential or sensitive data. Cyberattacks, ransomware, terrorism, increased use of artificial intelligence technologies or other malicious acts could damage, destroy or disrupt these systems for an extended period of time. The energy sector, including natural gas utility companies has become the subject of cyberattacks with increased frequency. 
 Page 18 

New Jersey Resources Corporation

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) 

 Additionally, the facilities and systems of clients, suppliers and third-party service providers could be vulnerable to the same cyber or terrorism risks as our facilities and systems, and such third-party systems may be interconnected to our systems both physically and technologically. Therefore, an event caused by cyberattacks, ransomware or other malicious acts at an interconnected third party could impact our business and facilities. Any failure or unexpected or unauthorized use of technology systems could result in the unavailability of such systems, and could result in a loss of operating revenues, an increase in operating expenses and costs to repair or replace damaged assets. Any of the above could also result in the loss or release of confidential customer and/or employee information or other proprietary data that could adversely affect our reputation and competitiveness, could result in costly litigation and negatively impact our results of operations. These cyberattacks have become more common and sophisticated and, as such, we could be required to incur costs to strengthen our systems and respond to emerging concerns. 
 
 There is no guarantee that redundancies built into our networks and technology, or the procedures we have implemented to protect against cyberattacks and other unauthorized access to secured data, will guarantee protection against all failures of technology or security breaches. Furthermore, despite our efforts to investigate, improve and remediate the capability and performance of our information technology system, we may not be able to discover all weaknesses, breaches and vulnerabilities, and failure to do so may expose us to higher risk of data loss and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations. 
 
 Failure to keep pace with technological change may limit customer growth and have an adverse effect on our operations. Advances in technology and changes in laws or regulations are reducing the cost of alternative methods of producing energy. In addition, customers are increasingly expecting enhanced communications regarding their electric and natural gas services, which, in some cases, may involve additional investments in technology. New technologies, including, but not limited to, cloud computing and generative artificial intelligence, may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive and may result in the obsolescence of certain of our operating assets. 
 
 Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and successfully adapt to technological changes and to offer services that meet customer demand. Failure to adapt to advances in technology and manage the related costs could make us less competitive and negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Risks Related to Regulations and Litigation 
 
 We are subject to governmental regulation. Compliance with current and future regulatory requirements and procurement of necessary approvals, permits and certificates may result in substantial costs to us. We are subject to substantial regulation from federal, state and local authorities. We are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations and to obtain numerous authorizations, permits, approvals and certificates from governmental agencies. These agencies regulate various aspects of our business, including customer rates, services, construction and natural gas pipeline operations. 
 
 FERC has regulatory authority over some of our operations, including sales of natural gas in the wholesale and retail markets and the purchase and sale of interstate pipeline and storage capacity, including Steckman Ridge, Leaf River and Adelphia. Any Congressional legislation or agency regulation that would alter these or other similar statutory and regulatory structures in a way to significantly raise costs that could not be recovered in rates from customers, that would reduce the availability of supply or capacity or that would reduce our competitiveness could negatively impact our earnings. In addition, changes in and compliance with laws such as the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011 could increase federal regulatory oversight and administrative costs that may not be recovered in rates from customers, which could have an adverse effect on our earnings. 
 
 We cannot predict the impact of any future revisions or changes in interpretations of existing regulations or the adoption of new laws and applicable regulations. Changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could influence our operating environment and may result in substantial costs to us. 
 
 Page 19 

New Jersey Resources Corporation

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) 

 Our regulated operations are subject to certain operating risks incidental to handling, storing, transporting and providing customers with natural gas. Our regulated operations are subject to all operating hazards and risks incidental to handling, storing, transporting and providing customers with natural gas, including our natural gas vehicle refueling stations and LNG facilities. These risks include catastrophic failure of the interstate pipeline system, explosions, pollution, release of toxic substances, fires, storms, safety issues and other adverse weather conditions and hazards, each of which could result in damage to or destruction of facilities or damage to persons and property. We could suffer substantial losses should any of these events occur. Although we maintain insurance coverage, insurance may not be sufficient to cover all material expenses related to these risks, and such insurance may be costly. 
 
 We are involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies that could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In the ordinary conduct of business, we are involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies with respect to general claims, rates, permitting, taxes, environmental issues, natural gas cost prudence reviews and other matters. Adverse decisions regarding these matters, to the extent they require us to make payments in excess of amounts provided for in our financial statements or are not covered by insurance or indemnity rights, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
 
 Our costs of compliance with present and future environmental laws are significant and could adversely affect our cash flows and profitability. Our operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and site remediation. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to expend financial resources to, among other things, conduct site remediation and perform environmental monitoring. If we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, even if we are unable to do so due to factors beyond our control, we may be subject to civil liabilities or criminal penalties and may be required to incur expenditures to come into compliance. Additionally, any alleged violations of environmental laws and regulations may require us to expend resources in our defense against alleged violations. 
 
 Furthermore, the U.S. Congress has for some time been considering various forms of climate change legislation. In addition, in July 2019, the State of New Jersey amended the GWRA, which targets 80 reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below 2006 levels economy-wide by 2050. In January 2020, Governor Murphy released the EMP confirming his commitment to achieve 100 clean energy by 2050, and the GWRA mandate of reducing state greenhouse gas emissions. The EMP addressed New Jersey s energy system, including electric generation, transportation and buildings, and their associated greenhouse gas emissions and related air pollutants. The EMP defines 100 clean energy by 2050 to mean 100 carbon-neutral electric generation and maximum electrification of the transportation and building sectors, which are the greatest carbon emission-producing sectors in the state, to meet or exceed the GWRA emissions reductions by 2050. Our goals, to reduce our New Jersey operational emissions by 60 from 2006 levels by 2030 and to achieve net-zero carbon emissions from our New Jersey operations by 2050, may require additional technological, legislative and regulatory developments, the impacts and costs of which may not be fully known at this time. 
 
 While the EMP does not place a moratorium or end date on natural gas hook ups, further legislation or rulemaking that de-emphasizes the role of natural gas in providing clean, low-cost energy in the state of New Jersey could put upward pressure on natural gas prices and place customer growth targets at risk. Higher cost levels could impact the competitive position of natural gas and negatively affect our growth opportunities, cash flows and earnings. 
 
 In February 2023, Governor Murphy issued two executive orders that established, or accelerated, previously established 2050 targets for clean-sourced electricity and electric heat pump adoption, with target dates of 2030 or 2035, as applicable. An additional executive order opened a proceeding to plan for the future of natural gas utilities in New Jersey. We are unable to predict the outcomes of these proceedings, but they could have a material impacts on our business, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Risks related to regulation could affect the rates we are able to charge, various costs and our profitability. NJNG is subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities. These authorities regulate many aspects of NJNG s distribution and transmission operations, including construction and maintenance of facilities, operations, safety, tariff rates that NJNG can charge customers, rates of return, the authorized cost of capital, recovery of pipeline replacement, environmental remediation costs and relationships with its affiliates. NJNG s ability to timely construct rate-based assets and obtain rate increases, including base rate increases, continue its BGSS incentive and CIP programs and maintain its currently authorized rates of return may be impacted by events, including regulatory or legislative actions. Additionally, in fiscal 2019, NJR began the process of transitioning away from its enterprise platform, which will no longer receive extended support after 2025. The first 
 Page 20 

New Jersey Resources Corporation

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) 

 phase of IT enhancements and upgrades were placed into service in July 2020. The remaining phases of planned upgrades relate to work order and asset management and customer information systems and experience, which are expected to require significant capital investment through fiscal year 2024. There can be no assurance that NJNG will be able to obtain rate increases and continue its BGSS incentive, CIP, RAC, or SAVEGREEN programs and IT upgrades and enhancements or continue to earn its currently authorized rates of return. 
 
 Adelphia is subject to regulation by FERC. FERC regulates many aspects of Adelphia s transmission operations, including construction and maintenance of facilities, operations, safety tariff rates that Adelphia can charge customers, rates of return, the authorized cost of capital, recovery of pipeline replacement and relations with its affiliates. Adelphia s ability to obtain rate increases and maintain its currently authorized rates of return may be impacted by events, including regulatory or legislative actions. There can be no assurance that Adelphia will be able to obtain rate increases or continue to earn its currently authorized rate of return. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Markets 
 Major changes in the supply and price of natural gas may affect financial results. While NJRES and NJNG expect to meet customers demand for natural gas for the foreseeable future, factors affecting suppliers and other third parties, including the inability to develop additional interstate pipeline infrastructure, lack of supply sources, increased competition, further deregulation, transportation costs, possible climate change legislation, energy efficiency mandates or changes in consumer behaviors, transportation availability and drilling for new natural gas resources, may impact the supply and price of natural gas. In addition, any significant disruption in the availability of supplies of natural gas could result in increased supply costs, higher prices for customers and potential supply disruptions to customers. 
 
 NJRES and NJNG actively hedge against the fluctuation in the price of natural gas by entering into forward and financial contracts with third parties. Should these third parties fail to perform, and regulators not allow the pass-through of expended funds to customers, it may result in a loss that could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Supply chain disruptions may adversely affect Company operations. The Company relies on third-party vendors and manufacturers to supply many of the materials necessary for its operations. Global logistics disruptions have impacted the flow of materials and restricted global trade flows. Manufacturers are competing for a limited supply of key commodities and logistical capacity, which has impacted lead times, pricing, supply and demand. Disruptions or delays in receiving materials; price increases from suppliers or manufacturers; or the inability to source needed materials, which has occurred and could reoccur, could adversely affect the Company s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 
 Changes in customer growth may affect earnings and cash flows. NJNG s ability to increase its Utility Gross Margin is dependent upon the new construction housing market, as well as the conversion of customers to natural gas from other fuel sources. During periods of extended economic downturns, prolonged weakness in housing markets or slowdowns in the conversion market, there could be an adverse impact on NJNG s Utility Gross Margin, earnings and cash flows. Furthermore, while our estimates regarding customer growth are based in part upon information from third parties, the estimates have not been verified by an independent source and are subject to the aforementioned risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to materially deviate from the estimates. 
 
 Our economic hedging activities that are designed to protect against commodity and financial market risks, including the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business, may cause fluctuations in reported financial results and financial losses that negatively impact results of operations and our stock price. We use derivatives, including futures, forwards, options, swaps and foreign exchange contracts, to manage commodity, financial market and foreign currency risks. The timing of the recognition of gains or losses associated with our economic hedges in accordance with GAAP does not always coincide with the gains or losses on the items being hedged. The difference in accounting can result in volatility in reported results, even though the expected profit margin is essentially unchanged from the dates the transactions were consummated. 
 
 In addition, we could recognize financial losses on these contracts as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could adversely affect the value of the reported fair value of these contracts. 
 Page 21 

New Jersey Resources Corporation 
 Part I 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) 

 We are exposed to market risk and may incur losses in our wholesale business. Our transportation and storage portfolios consist of contracts to transport and store natural gas. The value of our transportation and storage portfolio could be negatively impacted if the value of these contracts changes in a direction or manner that we do not anticipate. In addition, upon expiration of these transportation and storage contracts, to the extent that they are renewed or replaced at less favorable terms, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
 
 Inflation and increased natural gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase the Company s level of indebtedness. Inflation has caused, and may continue to cause, increases in certain operating and capital costs. Our regulated businesses have a process in place to review the adequacy of their rates in relation to the increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those rates. The ability to control expenses is an important factor that will influence future results. 
 
 Rapid increases in the price of purchased gas may cause the Company to experience a significant increase in short-term debt because it must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased, which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection from customers and counterparties for gas delivered. Increases in purchased gas costs could also slow collection efforts as NJNG customers may be more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills, leading to higher-than-normal accounts receivable. This situation could also result in higher short-term debt levels and increased bad debt expense. 
 
 Risks Related to Acquisition and Investment Strategies 
 Any acquisitions that we may undertake involve risks and uncertainties. We may not realize the anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities as a result of these transactions. The integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources. Investments of resources are required to support any acquisition, which could result in significant ongoing operating expenses, and we may experience challenges when combining separate business cultures, information technology systems and employees, and those challenges may divert senior management s time and attention. If we fail to successfully integrate assets and liabilities through the entities which we acquire, we may not fully realize all of the growth opportunities, benefits expected from the transaction, cost savings and other synergies and, as a result, the fair value of assets acquired could be impaired. We assess long-lived assets, including intangible assets associated with acquisitions, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable. To the extent the value of long-lived assets becomes impaired, the impairment charges could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The benefits that we expect to achieve from acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated growth opportunities and other synergies with our existing businesses. The success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate these transactions within our existing businesses in a timely and seamless manner. We may experience challenges when combining separate business cultures, information technology systems and employees. Even if we are able to complete an integration successfully, we may not fully realize all the growth opportunities, cost savings and other synergies that we expect. 
 
 Investing through partnerships or joint ventures decreases our ability to manage risk. We have utilized joint ventures through partnerships for certain S T investments. Although we currently have no specific plans to do so, we may acquire interests in other joint ventures or partnerships in the future. In these joint ventures or partnerships, we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures or partnerships, and other participants or investors may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives. In addition, the other participants may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of NJR and our subsidiaries and affiliates. Our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be harmed if a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interests. 
 
 Risks Related to Credit and Liquidity 
 NJR is a holding company and depends on its operating subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations. NJR is a holding company with no significant assets other than possible cash investments and the stock of its operating subsidiaries. We rely exclusively on dividends from our subsidiaries, on intercompany loans from our unregulated subsidiaries and on the repayments of principal and interest from intercompany loans and reimbursement of expenses from our subsidiaries for our cash flows. Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and to pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt depends on the payment of dividends to us by our subsidiaries or the repayment of loans to us by our subsidiaries. The extent to which our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or repay funds to us may adversely affect our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock and principal and interest to holders of our debt. 
 Page 22 

New Jersey Resources Corporation

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) 

 Credit rating downgrades could increase financing costs, limit access to the financial markets and negatively affect NJR and its subsidiaries. Rating agencies Moody s and Fitch currently rate NJNG s debt as investment grade. If such ratings are downgraded below investment grade, borrowing costs could increase, as would the costs of maintaining certain contractual relationships and obtaining future financing. Even if ratings are downgraded without falling below investment grade, NJR and NJNG could face increased borrowing costs under their current and future credit facilities. Our ability to borrow and costs of borrowing have a direct impact on our subsidiaries ability to execute their operating strategies, particularly in the case of NJNG, which relies heavily upon capital expenditures financed by its credit facility. 
 
 If we suffer a reduction in our credit and borrowing capacity or in our ability to issue parental guarantees, the business prospects of ES, CEV and S T, which rely on our creditworthiness, would be adversely affected. ES could possibly be required to comply with various margin or other credit enhancement obligations under its trading and marketing contracts, and it may be unable to continue to trade or be able to do so only on less favorable terms with certain counterparties. CEV could be required to seek alternative financing for its projects and may be unable to obtain such financing or able to do so only on less favorable terms. 
 
 Additionally, lower credit ratings could adversely affect relationships with NJNG s state regulators, who may be unwilling to allow NJNG to pass along increased costs to its natural gas customers. 
 
 If we are unable to access the financial markets or there are adverse conditions in the equity or credit markets, including, but not limited to, inflationary pressures, recessionary pressures, or rising interest rates, it could affect management s ability to execute our business plans. We rely on access to both short-term and long-term credit markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by our cash flow from operations. Any deterioration in our financial condition could hamper our ability to access the equity or credit markets or otherwise obtain debt financing on terms favorable to us or at all. In addition, because certain state regulatory approvals may be necessary for NJNG to incur debt, NJNG may be unable to access credit markets on a timely basis. 
 
 General economic factors beyond our control might create uncertainty that could increase our cost of capital or impair or eliminate our ability to access the debt, equity, or credit markets, including our ability to draw on bank credit facilities. External events could also increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to access the financial markets. Such external events could include the following: 
 economic weakness and/or political instability in the U.S. or in the regions where we operate; 
 political conditions, such as a shutdown of the U.S. federal government; 
 financial difficulties of unrelated energy companies; 
 capital market conditions generally; 
 volatility in the equity markets; 
 market prices for natural gas; 
 the overall health of the natural gas utility industry; and 
 fluctuations in interest rates and increased borrowing costs. 
 
 Failure by NJR and/or NJNG to comply with debt covenants may impact our financial condition. Our long-term debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debt-to-capital ratios. These debt obligations also contain provisions that put limitations on our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to expand or pursue certain business activities. For example, certain of these agreements contain provisions that, among other things, put limitations on our ability to make loans or investments, make material changes to the nature of our businesses, merge, consolidate or engage in asset sales, grant liens or make negative pledges. Furthermore, the debt obligations and our sale leaseback agreements contain covenants and other provisions requiring us to provide timely delivery of accurate financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations and/or the inability to borrow under existing revolving credit facilities and term loans. We have relied, and continue to rely, upon short-term bank borrowings or commercial paper supported by our revolving credit facilities to finance the execution of a portion of our operating strategies. NJNG is dependent on these capital sources to purchase its natural gas supply and maintain its properties. The acceleration of our outstanding debt obligations and our inability to borrow under the existing revolving credit facilities would cause a material adverse change in NJR s and NJNG s financial condition.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) 

 Our ability to secure short-term financing is subject to conditions in the credit markets. A prolonged constriction of credit availability could affect management s ability to execute our business plan. An inability to access capital may limit our ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions that we may otherwise rely on for both current operations and future growth. ES and NJNG execute derivative transactions with financial institutions as a part of their economic hedging strategy and could incur losses associated with the inability of a financial counterparty to meet or perform under its obligations as a result of adverse conditions in the credit markets or their ability to access capital or post collateral. 
 
 Risks Related to Tax and Accounting Matters 
 
 A valuation allowance may be required for our deferred tax assets. Our deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of investment tax credits and state net operating losses. Any revaluation of our deferred tax assets that may be required in the future could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The cost of providing pension and postemployment health care benefits to employees and eligible former employees is subject to changes in pension fund values, interest rates and changing demographics and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We have two defined benefit pension plans and two OPEB plans for the benefit of eligible full-time employees and qualified retirees, which were closed to all employees hired on or after January 1, 2012. The cost of providing these benefits to eligible current and former employees is subject to changes in the market value of the pension and OPEB fund assets, changing discount rates and changing actuarial assumptions based upon demographics, including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries, an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five years, impacts from healthcare legislation and increases in health care costs. 
 
 Significant declines in equity markets and/or reductions in bond yields can have a material adverse effect on the funded status of our pension and OPEB plans. In these circumstances, we may be required to recognize increased pension and OPEB expenses and/or be required to make additional cash contributions into the plans. 
 
 The funded status of these plans, and the related cost reflected in our financial statements, are affected by various factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, losses of asset values may necessitate increased funding of the plans in the future to meet minimum federal government requirements. A significant decrease in the asset values of these plans can result in funding obligations earlier than we had originally planned, which would have a negative impact on cash flows from operations, decrease our borrowing capacity and increase our interest expense. 
 
 Changes in tax laws, rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examinations by tax authorities may negatively affect our results of operations, net income, financial condition and cash flows. We are subject to taxation and audit by various taxing authorities at the federal, state and local levels. We cannot predict how our federal and state regulators will apply such tax changes in our future rates. While we believe we comply with all applicable tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, tax authorities may elect to audit us and determine that we owe additional taxes, which could result in a significant increase in our liabilities for taxes, interest and penalties in excess of our accrued liabilities. 
 
 New tax legislative initiatives may be proposed from time to time, such as proposals for comprehensive tax reform in the United States, which may impact our effective tax rate and which could adversely affect our tax positions or tax liabilities. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law and imposed a 15 minimum tax rate on book earnings for corporations with higher than 1B of annual income, along with a 1 excise tax on corporate stock repurchases while providing tax incentives to promote various clean energy initiatives. We are currently assessing the potential impact of these legislative changes. 
 
 Any future change in tax laws or interpretation of such laws could adversely affect our results of operations, net income, financial condition and cash flows.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued) 

 Significant regulatory assets recorded by our regulated companies could be disallowed for recovery from customers in the future. NJNG records regulatory assets on its financial statements to reflect the ratemaking and regulatory decision-making authority of the BPU as allowed by GAAP. The creation of a regulatory asset allows for the deferral of costs, which, absent a mechanism to recover such costs from customers in rates approved by the BPU, would be charged to expense on its income statement in the period incurred. Primary regulatory assets that are subject to BPU approval include the recovery of BGSS and USF costs, remediation costs associated with NJNG s MGP sites, CIP, NJCEP, economic stimulus plans, certain deferred income taxes and pension and OPEB. If there were to be a change in regulatory positions surrounding the collection of these deferred costs, there could be a material impact on NJNG s existing tariff or a future base rate case, as well as our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Adelphia records regulatory assets on its financial statements to reflect the ratemaking and regulatory decision-making authority of FERC as allowed by GAAP. The creation of a regulatory asset allows for the deferral of costs, which, absent a mechanism to recover such costs from customers in rates approved by FERC, would be recorded as a charge to earnings on its Statement of Operations in the period incurred. If there were to be a change in regulatory positions surrounding the collection of these deferred costs, there could be a material impact on Adelphia s existing rates or a future rate case, as well as our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Risks Related to Takeovers 
 
 Our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a transaction that shareowners would view as favorable. Our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws, as well as New Jersey law, contain provisions that could delay, defer or prevent an unsolicited change in control of NJR, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock or the ability of stockholders to participate in a transaction in which they might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then-current market price. These provisions may also prevent changes in management. In addition, our Board is authorized to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval on such terms as our Board may determine. Our common shareowners will be subject to, and may be negatively affected by, the rights of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. In addition, we are subject to the New Jersey Shareholders Protection Act, which could delay or prevent a change of control of NJR. 
 
 We may also be subject to actions or proposals from activist investors or others that may not be aligned with our long-term strategy or the interests of our other stockholders. This may interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plans, cause uncertainty with our regulators and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Moreover, our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any investor activism.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 Manufactured Gas Plant Remediation 
 
 NJNG is responsible for the remedial cleanup of certain former MGP sites, dating back to gas operations in the late 1800s and early 1900s, which contain contaminated residues from former gas manufacturing operations. NJNG is currently involved in administrative proceedings with the NJDEP and participating in various studies and investigations by outside consultants, to determine the nature and extent of any such contaminated residues and to develop appropriate programs of remedial action, where warranted, under NJDEP regulations. 
 
 Page 26 

New Jersey Resources Corporation 
 Part I 
 
 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (Continued) 

 NJNG periodically, and at least annually, performs an environmental review of former MGP sites located in Atlantic Highlands, Berkeley, Long Branch, Manchester, Toms River, Freehold and Aberdeen, New Jersey, including a review of potential liability for investigation and remedial action. NJNG estimated at the time of the most recent review that total future expenditures at the former MGP sites for which it is responsible, including potential liabilities for natural resource damages that might be brought by the NJDEP for alleged injury to groundwater or other natural resources concerning these sites, will range from approximately 137.3M to 201.5M. NJNG s estimate of these liabilities is based upon known facts, existing technology and enacted laws and regulations in place when the review was completed. Where it is probable that costs will be incurred, and the information is sufficient to establish a range of possible liability, NJNG accrues the most likely amount in the range. If no point within the range is more likely than the other, it is NJNG s policy to accrue the lower end of the range. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2023, NJNG recorded a MGP remediation liability and a corresponding regulatory asset of approximately 169.4M on the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the most likely amount. The actual costs to be incurred by NJNG are dependent upon several factors, including final determination of remedial action, changing technologies and governmental regulations, the ultimate ability of other responsible parties to pay and insurance recoveries, if any. 
 
 NJNG recovers its remediation expenditures, including carrying costs, over rolling seven-year periods pursuant to a RAC approved by the BPU. In March 2022, the BPU approved an increase in the RAC, which increased the pre-tax annual recovery from 11.1M to 11.7M, effective April 1, 2022. On April 12, 2023, the BPU approved on a final basis NJNG s annual SBC filing of RAC expenditures through June 30, 2022, as well as an increase to the RAC annual recoveries of 3.7M, which increased the pre-tax annual recovery to 15.4M, effective May 1, 2023. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, 66.3M of previously incurred remediation costs, net of recoveries from customers and insurance proceeds, are included in regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NJNG will continue to seek recovery of MGP-related costs through the RAC. If any future regulatory position indicates that the recovery of such costs is not probable, the related non-recoverable costs would be charged to income in the period of such determination. 
 
 General 
 
 The foregoing statements about NJR s litigation are based upon the Company s judgments, assumptions and estimates and are necessarily subjective and uncertain. The Company is involved, and from time to time in the future may be involved, in a number of pending and threatened judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings at various stages relating to matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation matters, particularly when such matters are in their early stages or where the claimants seek indeterminate damages, the Company cannot state with confidence what the eventual outcome of the pending litigation will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter will be, if any. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, NJR establishes accruals for litigation for those matters that present loss contingencies as to which it is both probable that a loss will be incurred, and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. NJR also discloses contingent matters for which there is a reasonable possibility of a loss. Based upon currently available information, NJR believes that the results of litigation that are currently pending, taken together, will not have a materially adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The actual results of resolving the pending litigation matters may be substantially higher than the amounts accrued.

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
 OPERATIONS 

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 We prepare our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Application of these accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingencies during the reporting period. We regularly evaluate our estimates, including those related to the calculation of the fair value of derivative instruments, acquisitions, regulatory assets, income taxes, pension and postemployment benefits other than pensions and contingencies related to environmental matters and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. In the normal course of business, estimated amounts are subsequently adjusted to actual results that may differ from estimates. 
 
 Regulatory Accounting 
 
 NJNG and Adelphia are subject to accounting requirements resulting from the effects of rate regulation. Specifically, NJNG and Adelphia record regulatory assets when it is considered probable that certain operating costs will be recoverable from customers in future periods and record regulatory liabilities when it is probable future obligations to customers exist. 
 
 Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. For NJNG, the BPU s regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Decisions to be made by the BPU in the future will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable costs and return on invested capital included in rates and any refunds that may be required. If the BPU indicates that recovery of all or a portion of a regulatory asset is not probable or does not allow for recovery of and a reasonable return on investments in property plant and equipment, a charge to income would be made in the period of such determination. 
 
 Environmental Costs 
 
 At the end of each fiscal year, NJNG, with the assistance of an independent consulting firm, updates the environmental review of its MGP sites, including its potential liability for investigation and remedial action. From this review, NJNG estimates expenditures necessary to remediate and monitor these MGP sites. NJNG s estimate of these liabilities is developed from then-currently available facts, existing technology and current laws and regulations. 
 
 In accordance with accounting standards for contingencies, NJNG s policy is to record a liability when it is probable that the cost will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated. NJNG will determine a range of liabilities and will record the most likely amount. If no point within the range is more likely than any other, NJNG will accrue the lower end of the range. Since we believe that recovery of these expenditures, as well as related litigation costs, is probable through the regulatory process, we record a regulatory asset corresponding to the related accrued liability. Accordingly, NJNG records an MGP remediation liability and a corresponding regulatory asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, which is based on the most likely amount. 
 
 The actual costs to be incurred by NJNG are dependent upon several factors, including final determination of remedial action, changing technologies and governmental regulations and the ultimate ability of other responsible parties to pay, as well as the potential impact of any litigation and any insurance recoveries. Previously incurred remediation costs, net of recoveries from customers and insurance proceeds received are included in regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 If there are changes in the regulatory position surrounding these costs, or should actual expenditures vary significantly from estimates in that these costs are disallowed for recovery by the BPU, such costs would be charged to income in the period of such determination. See the Legal Proceedings section in Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for more details.

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
 OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 Postemployment Employee Benefits 
 
 Our costs of providing postemployment employee benefits are dependent upon numerous factors, including actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Postemployment employee benefit costs are affected by actual employee demographics including age, compensation levels and employment periods, the level of contributions made to the plans, changes in long-term interest rates and the return on plan assets. Changes made to the provisions of the plans or healthcare legislation may also impact current and future postemployment employee benefit costs. Postemployment employee benefit costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets, changes in mortality tables, health care cost trends and discount rates used in determining the PBO. In determining the PBO and cost amounts, assumptions can change from period to period and could result in material changes to net postemployment employee benefit periodic costs and the related liability recognized. 
 
 The remeasurement of plan assets and obligations for a significant event should occur as of the date of the significant event. We may use a practical expedient to remeasure the plan assets and obligations as of the nearest calendar month-end date. When performing interim remeasurements, we obtain new asset values, roll forward the obligation to reflect population changes and review the appropriateness of all assumptions, regardless of the reason for performing the interim remeasurement. 
 
 Our postemployment employee benefit plan assets consist primarily of U.S. equity securities, international equity securities, fixed-income investments and other assets, with a targeted allocation of 34 , 17 , 33 and 16 , respectively. Fluctuations in actual market returns, as well as changes in interest rates, may result in increased or decreased postemployment employee benefit costs in future periods. Postemployment employee benefit expenses are included in O M and other income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
 OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 Acquisitions 
 
 The Company follows the guidance in ASC 805, Business Combinations, for determining the appropriate accounting treatment for acquisitions. ASU No. 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business , provides an initial fair value screen to determine if substantially all of the fair value of the assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset or group of similar assets. If the initial screening test is not met, the set is considered a business based on whether there are inputs and substantive processes in place. Based on the results of this analysis and conclusion on an acquisition s classification of a business combination or an asset acquisition, the accounting treatment is derived. 
 
 If the acquisition is deemed to be a business, the acquisition method of accounting is applied. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date are recorded at fair value. If the transaction is deemed to be an asset purchase, the cost accumulation and allocation model is used, whereby the assets and liabilities are recorded based on the purchase price and allocated to the individual assets and liabilities based on relative fair values. 
 
 The determination and allocation of fair values to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment. The most significant variables in these valuations are discount rates and the number of years on which to base the cash flow projections, as well as other assumptions and estimates used to determine the cash inflows and outflows. Management determines discount rates based on the risk inherent in the acquired assets and related cash flows. The valuation of an acquired business is based on available information at the acquisition date and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. However, a change in facts and circumstances as of the acquisition date can result in subsequent adjustments during the measurement period, but no later than one year from the acquisition date. 
 
 Investments in Equity Investees 
 
 The Company accounts for its investment in Steckman Ridge using the equity method of accounting where it is not the primary beneficiary, as defined under ASC 810, Consolidation, in that its respective ownership interests are 50 or less and/or it has significant influence over operating and management decisions. The Company s share of earnings is recognized as equity in earnings of affiliates on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 Equity method investments are reviewed for impairment when changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the current fair value may be less than the asset s carrying amount. Factors that the Company analyzes in determining whether an impairment in its equity investments exists include reviewing the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investees, including economic conditions and trends in the general market, significant delays in or failure to complete significant projects, unfavorable regulatory or legal actions expected to substantially impact future earnings potential and lower-than-expected cash distributions from investees. If the Company determines the decline in the value of its equity method investment is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. 
 
 When impairment indicators are present, the fair value of the Company s investment in Steckman Ridge is determined using a discounted cash flow method and utilizes management s best estimates and assumptions related to expected future results, including the price and capacity of firm natural gas storage contracting, operations and maintenance costs, discount rates and the nature and timing of major maintenance and capital investment. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and other factors. As a result, it is reasonably possible that unfavorable developments, such as the failure to execute storage contracts and other services for available capacity at anticipated price levels, could result in an other-than-temporary impairment charge in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Impairment of Long-lived Assets 
 
 Property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for impairment when changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance. Factors that the Company analyzes in determining whether an impairment in its long-lived assets exists include determining if a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset is present; a significant adverse change in the extent to which a long-lived asset is being used in its physical condition; legal proceedings or factors; significant business climate changes; accumulations of costs in significant excess of the amounts expected; a current-period operating or cash flow loss coupled with historical negative cash flows or expected future negative cash flows; and current expectations that more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. When an impairment indicator is present, the Company determines if the carrying value of the asset is recoverable by comparing it to its expected undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying value of the asset is greater than the expected undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. 
 
 Derivative Instruments 
 
 We record our derivative instruments held as assets and liabilities at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, since we choose not to designate any of our physical and financial natural gas commodity derivatives as accounting hedges, changes in the fair value of ES s commodity derivatives are recognized in earnings, as they occur, as a component of operating revenues or natural gas purchases on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts are recognized in natural gas purchases on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 The fair value of derivative instruments is determined by reference to quoted market prices of listed exchange-traded contracts, published price quotations, pipeline tariff information or a combination of those items. ES s portfolio is valued using the most current and reasonable market information. If the price underlying a physical commodity transaction does not represent a visible and liquid market, ES may utilize additional published pipeline tariff information and/or other services to determine an equivalent market price. As of September 30, 2023, the fair value of its derivative assets and liabilities reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets that is based on such pricing is considered immaterial. 
 
 Should there be a significant change in the underlying market prices or pricing assumptions, ES may experience a significant impact on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Refer to Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks for a sensitivity analysis related to the impact to derivative fair values resulting from changes in commodity prices. The valuation methods we use to determine fair values remained consistent for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. We apply a discount to our derivative assets to factor in an adjustment associated with the credit risk of its physical natural gas counterparties and to our derivative liabilities to factor in an adjustment associated with its own credit risk. We determine this amount by using historical default probabilities corresponding to the appropriate S P issuer ratings. Since the majority of our counterparties are rated investment grade, this results in an immaterial credit risk adjustment. 
 
 Gains and losses associated with derivatives utilized by NJNG to manage the price risk inherent in its natural gas purchasing activities are recoverable through its BGSS, subject to BPU approval. Accordingly, the offset to the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 CEV hedges certain of its expected production of SRECs through forward and futures contracts. CEV intends to physically deliver all SRECs it sells and recognizes SREC revenue as operating revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Operations upon delivery of the underlying SREC. 
 
 We have not designated any derivatives as fair value or cash flow hedges as of September 30, 2023 and 2022.

 Income Taxes 
 
 The determination of our provision for income taxes requires the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of tax laws. Judgment is required in assessing the deductibility and recoverability of certain tax benefits. We use the asset and liability method to determine and record deferred tax assets and liabilities, representing future tax benefits and taxes payable, which result from the differences in basis recorded in GAAP financial statements and amounts recorded in the income tax returns. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded utilizing the statutorily enacted tax rates expected to be in effect at the time the assets are realized and/or the liabilities settled. An offsetting valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred income tax assets won t be realized. Any significant changes to the estimates and judgments with respect to the interpretations, timing or deductibility could result in a material change to earnings and cash flows. 
 
 For state income tax and other taxes, estimates and judgments are required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions. In addition, we operate within multiple tax jurisdictions and are subject to audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We maintain a liability for the estimate of potential income tax exposure and, in our opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years reported. Any significant changes to the estimates and judgments with respect to the apportionment factor could result in a material change to earnings and cash flows. 
 
 Occasionally, the federal and state taxing authorities determine that it is necessary to make certain changes to the income tax laws. These changes may include but are not limited to changes in the tax rates and/or the treatment of certain items of income or expense. Accounting guidance requires that the Company reflect the effect of changes in tax laws or tax rates at the date of enactment. Additionally, the Company is required to re-measure its deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment. For non-regulated entities, the effects of changes in tax laws or tax rates are required to be included in income from continuing operations for the period that includes the enactment date. For regulated entities, if as the result of an action by a regulator it is probable that the future increase or decrease in taxes payable for items such as changes in tax laws or rates will be recovered from or returned to customers through future rates, an asset or liability shall be recognized for that probable increase or decrease in future revenue. Accounting guidance also requires that regulatory liabilities and/or assets be considered a temporary difference for which a related deferred tax asset and/or liability shall be recognized. 
 
 Accounting guidance requires that we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that the positions will not be sustained when challenged by taxing authorities. Any changes to the estimates and judgments with respect to the interpretations, timing or deductibility could result in a change to earnings and cash flows. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, are recognized within income tax expense, and accrued interest and penalties are recognized within accrued taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 To the extent that NJNG invests in property that qualifies for ITCs, the ITC is deferred and amortized to income over the life of the equipment in accordance with regulatory treatment. In general, for our unregulated subsidiaries, we record ITCs on the balance sheet as a contra-asset as a reduction to property, plant and equipment when the property is placed in service. The contra-asset is amortized on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction to depreciation expense over the useful lives of the related assets. 
 
 Changes to the federal statutes related to ITCs, which have the effect of reducing or eliminating the credits, could have a negative impact on earnings and cash flows.

 Reporting Segments 
 
 We have four primary reporting segments as presented in the chart below: 
 
 In addition to our four reporting segments above, we have nonutility operations that either provide corporate support services or do not meet the criteria to be treated as a separate reporting segment. These operations, which comprise HSO, include appliance repair services, sales and installations at NJRHS and commercial real estate holdings at CR R. 
 
 Operating Results 
 
 Net income (loss) and assets by reporting segment and other business operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, are as follows:

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
 OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 The decrease in net income of 10.2M during fiscal 2023, compared with fiscal 2022, is due primarily to decreased earnings at NJNG due to higher O M and higher interest expense related to new debt at higher interest rates, and decreased earnings at S T resulting from increased interest and depreciation expenses. These decreases are partially offset by increased earnings at ES due primarily to higher natural gas price volatility in December 2022 and February 2023 and by increased earnings at CEV related to the reversal of a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets. The primary drivers of the changes noted above are described in more detail in the individual reporting segment and other business operations discussions. 
 
 The increase in assets during fiscal 2023, compared with fiscal 2022, was due primarily to additional investment in utility plant at NJNG and solar asset investments at CEV, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable, gas in storage and restricted broker margin at ES and NJNG resulting from a decline in natural gas prices. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Our management uses NFE, a non-GAAP financial measure, when evaluating our operating results. ES economically hedges its natural gas inventory with financial derivative instruments. NFE is a measure of the earnings based on eliminating timing differences surrounding the recognition of certain gains or losses, to effectively match the earnings effects of the economic hedges with the physical sale of natural gas and, therefore, eliminates the impact of volatility to GAAP earnings associated with the derivative instruments. To the extent we utilize forwards, futures or other derivatives to hedge forecasted SREC production, unrealized gains and losses are also eliminated from NFE. NFE also excludes certain transactions associated with equity method investments, including impairment charges, which are non-cash charges, and return of capital in excess of the carrying value of our investment. These are considered unusual in nature and occur infrequently such that they are not indicative of our performance for ongoing operations. Included in the tax effects are current and deferred income tax expense corresponding with the components of NFE. 
 
 Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or a replacement of, the comparable GAAP measure and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results. 
 
 Below is a reconciliation of consolidated net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to NFE for the fiscal years ended September 30:

 The increase in NFE of 21.5M during fiscal 2023, compared with fiscal 2022, was due primarily to higher Financial Margin at ES along with an increase in the benefit from income taxes at CEV, partially offset by decreases at NJNG and S T, as previously discussed. 

Natural Gas Distribution 
 
 Overview 
 
 Natural Gas Distribution is comprised of NJNG, a natural gas utility that provides regulated natural gas service throughout Burlington, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean and Sussex counties in New Jersey to approximately 576,000 residential and commercial customers in its service territory and also participates in the off-system sales and capacity release markets. The business is subject to various risks, which may include but are not limited to impacts to customer growth and customer usage, customer collections, the timing and costs of capital expenditures and construction of infrastructure projects, operating and financing costs, fluctuations in commodity prices and customer conservation efforts. In addition, NJNG may be subject to adverse economic conditions such as inflation and rising natural gas costs, certain regulatory actions, environmental remediation and severe weather conditions. It is often difficult to predict the impact of events or trends associated with these risks. 
 
 NJNG s business is seasonal by nature, as weather conditions directly influence the volume of natural gas delivered to customers on an annual basis. Specifically, customer demand substantially increases during the winter months when natural gas is used for heating purposes. As a result, NJNG generates most of its natural gas distribution revenues during the first and second fiscal quarters and is subject to variations in earnings and working capital during the fiscal year. 
 
 As a regulated company, NJNG is required to recognize the impact of regulatory decisions on its financial statements. See Note 4. Regulation in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of regulatory actions, including filings related to programs and associated expenditures, as well as rate requests related to recovery of capital investments and operating costs. 
 
 NJNG s operations are managed with the goal of providing safe and reliable service, growing its customer base, diversifying its Utility Gross Margin, promoting clean energy programs and mitigating the risks discussed above. 
 
 Base Rate Case 
 
 In November 2021, the BPU issued an order adopting a stipulation of settlement approving a 79.0M increase to base rates, effective December 1, 2021. In addition, the order also included approval for the final increase for the NJ RISE/SAFE II programs, which totaled 0.3M. These increases include an overall rate of return on rate base of 6.84 , return on common equity of 9.6 , a common equity ratio of 54.0 and a composite depreciation rate of 2.78 .

 Infrastructure Projects 
 
 NJNG has significant annual capital expenditures associated with the management of its natural gas distribution and transmission system, including new utility plant associated with customer growth and its associated PIM and infrastructure programs. Below is a summary of NJNG s capital expenditures, including accruals for fiscal 2023 and estimates of expected investments over the next fiscal year: 
 
 Estimated capital expenditures are reviewed on a regular basis and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory oversight, environmental regulations, unforeseen events and the ability to access capital. 
 
 NJNG continues to implement BPU-approved infrastructure projects that are designed to enhance the reliability and integrity of NJNG s natural gas distribution system. 
 
 Infrastructure Investment Program 
 
 In February 2019, NJNG filed a petition with the BPU seeking authority to implement a five-year IIP. The IIP consisted of two components: transmission and distribution investments and information technology replacement and enhancements. The total investment for the IIP was approximately 507.0M. All approved investments will be recovered through annual filings to adjust base rates. In October 2020, the BPU approved the Company s transmission and distribution component of the IIP for 150.0M over five years, effective November 1, 2020. NJNG voluntarily withdrew the information technology upgrade component and will seek to recover associated costs in future rate case proceedings. In March 2022, NJNG filed its first rate recovery request for its BPU-approved IIP with capital expenditures estimated through June 30, 2022, including AFUDC. In July 2022, NJNG filed its update with actual capital expenditures of 28.9M through June 30, 2022. In September 2022, the BPU approved the rate increase resulting in a 3.2M revenue increase, effective October 1, 2022. 
 
 On March 30, 2023, NJNG submitted its annual IIP filing to the BPU requesting a rate increase for estimated capital expenditures of 31.4M through June 30, 2023. This filing was updated on July 28, 2023, with actual expenses of approximately 28.2M through June 30, 2023. The BPU approved this filing on September 27, 2023, which resulted in a 3.2M revenue increase, effective October 1, 2023.

 SAFE II and NJ RISE 
 
 The BPU approved the 5-year SAFE II program and the associated rate mechanism to replace the remaining unprotected steel mains and services from NJNG s natural gas distribution system at an estimated cost of approximately 200.0M, excluding AFUDC. With the approval of SAFE II, 157.5M was approved for accelerated cost recovery methodology. The remaining 42.5M in capital expenditures was requested for recovery in base rate cases, of which 23.4M was approved in NJNG s 2019 base rate case and 19.1M was approved in the 2021 base rate case. 
 
 The BPU approved NJNG s NJ RISE capital infrastructure program, which consists of six capital investment projects estimated to cost 102.5M, excluding AFUDC, for natural gas distribution storm hardening and mitigation projects, along with associated depreciation expense. These system enhancements are intended to minimize service impacts during extreme weather events to customers in the most storm-prone areas of NJNG s service territory. Recovery of NJ RISE investments is included in NJNG s base rates. 
 
 In March 2021, NJNG filed a petition with the BPU requesting the final base rate increase for the recovery associated with NJ RISE and SAFE II capital investments costs of approximately 3.4M made through June 30, 2021. In June 2021, this filing was consolidated with the 2021 base rate case. In November 2021, the BPU issued an order for the consolidated matter which included approval for the final increase for the NJ RISE and SAFE II programs of 0.3M.With this approval, the filings with respect to NJ RISE and SAFE II are complete. 

Customer Growth 
 
 In conducting NJNG s business, management focuses on factors it believes may have significant influence on its future financial results. NJNG s policy is to work with all stakeholders, including customers, regulators and policymakers, to achieve favorable results. These factors include the rate of NJNG s customer growth in its service territory, which can be influenced by political and regulatory policies, the delivered cost of natural gas compared with competing fuels, interest rates and general economic and business conditions. 
 
 NJNG s total customers as of September 30, include the following: 
 2023 2022 2021 Firm customers Residential 520,682 512,264 502,546 Commercial, industrial other 31,725 31,227 30,615 Residential transport 15,457 17,316 21,882 Commercial transport 8,033 8,397 8,815 Total firm customers 575,897 569,204 563,858 Other 103 96 47 Total customers 576,000 569,300 563,905 
 
 During fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, NJNG added 8,800, 7,808 and 7,854 new customers, respectively. NJNG expects new customer additions, and those customers who added additional natural gas services to their premises, to contribute approximately 7.4M of incremental Utility Gross Margin on an annualized basis. 
 
 NJNG expects its new customer annual growth rate to be approximately 1.9 . Based on information from municipalities and developers, as well as external industry analysts and management s experience, NJNG estimates that approximately 67 of the growth will come from new construction markets and 33 from customer conversions to natural gas from other fuel sources. This new customer and conversion growth would increase Utility Gross Margin under NJNG s base rates by approximately 8.5M annually, as calculated under NJNG s CIP tariff.

 Energy Efficiency Programs 
 
 SAVEGREEN conducts home energy audits and provides various grants, incentives and financing alternatives designed to encourage the installation of high-efficiency heating and cooling equipment and other energy efficiency upgrades. Depending on the specific incentive or approval, NJNG recovers costs associated with the programs over a two- to 10-year period through a tariff rider mechanism. In March 2021, the BPU approved a three-year SAVEGREEN program consisting of approximately 126.1M of direct investment, 109.4M in financing options and approximately 23.4M in operation and maintenance expenses, which resulted in a 15.6M annual recovery increase, effective July 1, 2021. 
 
 In May 2020, NJNG filed a petition with the BPU to decrease its EE recovery rate. In October 2020, the BPU approved NJNG to maintain its existing rate, which resulted in an annual recovery of approximately 11.4M, effective November 1, 2020. 
 
 In June 2021, NJNG submitted its annual cost recovery filing for the SAVEGREEN programs established from 2010 through 2021. In January 2022, the BPU approved the stipulation, which increased annual recoveries by 2.2M, effective February 1, 2022. 
 
 In June 2022, NJNG submitted its annual cost recovery filing for the SAVEGREEN programs established from 2010 through the present. In September 2022, the BPU approved the rate decrease, which resulted in an annual decrease of approximately 3.5M, effective October 1, 2022. 
 
 On June 1, 2023, NJNG submitted its annual cost recovery filing for the SAVEGREEN programs established from 2010 through the present, which would increase annual recoveries by approximately 10.7M. On September 27, 2023, the BPU approved an increase to the EE rate, increasing annual recoveries by 9.0M based on updated information since the initial filing, effective October 1, 2023. 
 
 The following table summarizes loans, grants, rebates and related investments as of September 30:

 Program recoveries from customers during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, were 26.3M and 25.8M, respectively. The recovery includes a weighted average cost of capital that ranges from 6.69 to 7.76 , with a return on equity of 9.6 to 10.3 . 
 
 Conservation Incentive Program/BGSS 
 
 The CIP facilitates normalizing NJNG s Utility Gross Margin for variances not only due to weather but also other factors affecting customer usage, such as conservation and energy efficiency. Recovery of Utility Gross Margin for the non-weather variance through the CIP is limited to the amount of certain natural gas supply cost savings achieved and is subject to a variable margin revenue test. Additionally, recovery of the CIP Utility Gross Margin is subject to an annual earnings test. An annual review of the CIP must be filed by June 1, coincident with NJNG s annual BGSS filing, during which NJNG can request rate changes to the CIP. 
 
 NJNG s total utility firm gross margin includes the following adjustments related to the CIP mechanism:

 Recovery of Natural Gas Costs 
 
 NJNG s cost of natural gas is passed through to our customers, without markup, by applying NJNG s authorized BGSS rate to actual therms delivered. There is no Utility Gross Margin associated with BGSS costs; therefore, changes in such costs do not impact NJNG s earnings. NJNG monitors its actual natural gas costs in comparison to its BGSS rates to manage its cash flows associated with its allowed recovery of natural gas costs, which is facilitated through BPU-approved deferred accounting and the BGSS pricing mechanism. Accordingly, NJNG occasionally adjusts its periodic BGSS rates or can issue credits or refunds, as appropriate, for its residential and small commercial customers when the commodity cost varies from the existing BGSS rate. BGSS rates for its large commercial customers are adjusted monthly based on NYMEX prices. 
 
 NJNG s residential and commercial markets are currently open to competition, and its rates are segregated between BGSS (i.e., natural gas commodity) and delivery (i.e., transportation) components. NJNG earns Utility Gross Margin through the delivery of natural gas to its customers and, therefore, is not negatively affected by customers who use its transportation service and purchase natural gas from another supplier. Under an existing order from the BPU, BGSS can be provided by suppliers other than the state s natural gas utilities; however, customers who purchase natural gas from another supplier continue to use NJNG for transportation service. 
 
 During fiscal 2021, NJNG notified the BPU of its intent to provide BGSS bill credits to residential and small commercial sales customers. The actual bill credits given to customers totaled 20.6M, 19.3M net of tax. 
 
 In November 2021, the BPU approved on a preliminary basis a 2.9M increase to the annual revenues credited to BGSS, a 13.0M annual increase related to its balancing charge, as well as changes to CIP rates, which resulted in a 6.3M annual recovery decrease, effective December 1, 2021, and approved on a final basis in May 2022. 
 
 In November 2021, NJNG submitted notification of its intent to self-implement an increase to its BGSS rate, which resulted in an approximately 24.2M increase to annual revenues credited to BGSS, effective December 1, 2021. 
 
 In June 2022, NJNG submitted its annual petition to modify its BGSS, balancing charge and CIP rates for residential and small business customers, which was approved by the BPU on a preliminary basis in September 2022. This includes an 81.9M increase to the annual revenues credited to BGSS, a 9.0M annual increase related to its balancing charge and a 10.2M increase to CIP rates, effective October 1, 2022, which was approved on a final basis on April 12, 2023. 
 
 On April 12, 2023, the BPU approved on a final basis, NJNG s February 22, 2023 filing that advised the BPU of a bill credit and a reduction to the BGSS rate for residential and small commercial customers, which will reduce recoveries by approximately 29.9M, effective March 1, 2023. Bill credits provided to customers from March 2023 through May 2023 totaled approximately 32.4M. 
 
 On June 1, 2023, NJNG filed its annual petition to modify its BGSS, balancing charge and CIP rates for residential and small business customers. This included a 38.6M decrease to the annual revenues credited to BGSS, a 7.4M annual decrease related to its balancing charge and a 27.5M increase to CIP rates, effective October 1, 2023. On September 18, 2023, the BPU approved, on a provisional basis, the filed BGSS and balancing charge changes and a 27.0M increase to CIP rates, based on updated information since the initial filing. The balancing charge rate includes the cost of balancing natural gas deliveries with customer usage for sales and transportation customers, and balancing charge revenues are credited to BGSS. 
 
 BGSS Incentive Programs 
 
 NJNG is eligible to receive financial incentives for reducing BGSS costs through a series of Utility Gross Margin-sharing programs that include off-system sales, capacity release and storage incentive programs. These programs are designed to encourage better utilization and hedging of NJNG s natural gas supply, transportation and storage assets. Depending on the program, NJNG shares 80 or 85 of Utility Gross Margin generated by these programs with firm customers. Utility Gross Margin from incentive programs was 20.0M, 19.6M and 13.4M during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

 Hedging 
 
 In order to provide relative price stability to its natural gas supply portfolio, NJNG employs a hedging strategy with the goal of having at least 75 of the Company s projected winter periodic BGSS natural gas sales volumes hedged by each November 1 and at least 25 of the projected periodic BGSS natural gas sales hedged for the following April-through-March period. The hedging goal is typically achieved with gas in storage and the use of financial instruments to hedge storage injections. NJNG may also use various financial instruments including futures, swaps, options and weather-related products to hedge its future delivery obligations. 
 
 Commodity Prices 
 
 NJNG is affected by the price of natural gas, which can have a significant impact on our cash flows, short-term financing costs, the price of natural gas charged to our customers through the BGSS clause, our ability to collect accounts receivable, which impacts our bad debt expense, and our ability to maintain a competitive advantage over other energy sources. Natural gas commodity prices are shown in the graph below, which illustrates the daily natural gas prices (1) in the Northeast market region, also known as TETCO M-3. 
 
 (1) Data sourced from Standard Poor s Financial Services, LLC Global Platts. 
 
 The maximum price per MMBtu was 32.46, 17.69 and 14.57 and the minimum price was 0.67, 2.42 and 0.28 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. A more detailed discussion of the impacts of the price of natural gas on operating revenues, natural gas purchases and cash flows can be found in the Operating Results and Cash Flow sections of Item 7.

 Societal Benefits Charge 
 
 NJNG s qualifying customers are eligible for the USF program, which is administered by the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, to help make energy bills more affordable. 
 
 In March 2022, the BPU approved on a final basis NJNG s annual SBC application to recover remediation expenses, including an increase in the RAC, of approximately 0.6M annually and a decrease to the NJCEP factor of approximately 2.9M, effective April 1, 2022. 
 
 In June 2022, NJNG filed its annual USF compliance filing proposing a decrease to the statewide USF rate. In August 2022, an additional update was submitted on behalf of all NJ utilities with actual information through July 31, 2022. In September 2022, the BPU approved a decrease based on the August update, which resulted in an annual decrease of approximately 1.6M, effective October 1, 2022. 
 
 In September 2022, NJNG submitted its annual SBC filing to the BPU requesting approval of RAC expenditures through June 30, 2022, as well as an increase to the RAC annual recoveries of 3.8M and an increase to the NJCEP annual recoveries of 2.2M, with a proposed effective date of April 1, 2023. On April 12, 2023, the BPU approved on a final basis, an increase to the RAC annual recoveries of 3.7M and a decrease to the NJCEP annual recoveries of 0.9M, effective May 1, 2023. 
 
 On June 28, 2023, NJNG submitted its annual USF filing to the BPU requesting an increase to the statewide USF rate, which will result in a 0.7M increase to annual recoveries. The BPU approved this matter on September 27, 2023, effective October 1, 2023. 
 
 On September 11, 2023, NJNG submitted its annual SBC filing to the BPU requesting approval of RAC expenditures through June 2023, as well as an increase to the RAC annual recoveries of 2.4M and an increase to the NJCEP annual recoveries of 5.0M, which would be effective April 1, 2024. 
 
 Environmental Remediation 
 
 NJNG is responsible for the environmental remediation of former MGP sites, which contain contaminated residues from former gas manufacturing operations that ceased operating at these sites by the mid-1950s and, in some cases, had been discontinued many years earlier. Actual MGP remediation costs may vary from management s estimates due to the developing nature of remediation requirements, regulatory decisions by the NJDEP and related litigation. NJNG reviews these costs at the end of each fiscal year and adjusts its liability and corresponding regulatory asset as necessary to reflect its expected future remediation obligation. Accordingly, NJNG recognized a regulatory asset and an obligation of 169.4M as of September 30, 2023, an increase of 42.3M compared with the prior fiscal period. 
 
 In June 2019, NJNG initiated a preliminary assessment of a site in Aberdeen, New Jersey to determine prior ownership and if former MGP operations were active at the location. The preliminary assessment and site investigation activities are ongoing at the Aberdeen site and, based on initial findings, will be moving to the remedial investigation phase. The costs associated with preliminary assessment, site investigation and remedial investigation activities are considered immaterial and are included as a component of NJNG s annual SBC application to recover remediation expenses. We will continue to gather information to further refine and enhance the estimate of potential costs for this site as it becomes available. See Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for a more detailed description. 
 
 Other regulatory filings and a more detailed discussion of the filings in this section can be found in Note 4. Regulation in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

 (1) Includes nonutility revenue of approximately 1.3M, 1.4M and 0.3M for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for lease agreements with various NJR subsidiaries leasing office space from NJNG at the Company s headquarters that commenced in July 2021, which are eliminated in consolidation. 
 (2) Includes the purchased cost of the natural gas, fees paid to pipelines and storage facilities, adjustments as a result of BGSS incentive programs and hedging transactions. These expenses are passed through to customers and are offset by corresponding revenues. 
 (3) Includes related party transactions of approximately 9.3M for both fiscal 2023 and 2022, and 13.0M for fiscal 2021, a portion of which is eliminated in consolidation. 
 (4) Consists of expenses associated with state-mandated programs, the RAC and energy efficiency programs, calculated on a per-therm basis. These expenses are passed through to customers and are offset by corresponding revenues. 
 
 Operating Revenues and Natural Gas Purchases 
 
 Operating revenues decreased 10.3 during fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022. Natural gas purchases decreased 23.6 during fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022. 
 
 The factors contributing to the increases and decreases in operating revenues and natural gas purchases during fiscal 2023, are as follows: 
 2023 v. 2022 
 (Thousands) Operating revenues Natural gas purchases BGSS incentives (156,951) (157,384) Bill credits (31,581) (31,581) Firm sales (24,005) (19,536) Average BGSS rates 75,105 75,105 CIP adjustments 23,656 Base rate impact 6,927 Riders and other (1)

 (1) Riders and other includes changes in rider rates, including those related to Energy Efficiency, NJCEP and other programs, which is offset in regulatory rider expense. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Management uses Utility Gross Margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, when evaluating the operating results of NJNG. NJNG s Utility Gross Margin is defined as operating revenues less natural gas purchases, sales tax and regulatory rider expenses. This measure differs from gross margin as presented on a GAAP basis, as it excludes certain operations and maintenance expense and depreciation and amortization. Utility Gross Margin may also not be comparable to the definition of gross margin used by others in the natural gas distribution business and other industries. Management believes that Utility 
 Page 43 

New Jersey Resources Corporation 
 Part II 
 
 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
 OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 Gross Margin provides a meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations since natural gas costs, sales tax and regulatory rider expenses are included in operating revenues and passed through to customers and, therefore, have no effect on Utility Gross Margin. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the comparable GAAP measure. 
 
 Utility Gross Margin 
 
 A reconciliation of gross margin, the closest GAAP financial measure to NJNG s Utility Gross Margin for the fiscal years ended September 30, is as follows: 
 (Thousands) 2023 2022 2021 Operating revenues 1,012,633 1,128,767 731,796 Less: Natural gas purchases 425,457 557,232 260,714 Operation and maintenance (1)

 (1) Excludes selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately 111.5M, 102.8M and 97.0M for the fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 Utility Gross Margin consists of three components: 
 
 Utility firm gross margin generated from only the delivery component of either a sales tariff or a transportation tariff from residential and commercial customers who receive natural gas service from NJNG; 
 
 BGSS incentive programs, where revenues generated or savings achieved from BPU-approved off-system sales, capacity release or storage incentive programs are shared between customers and NJNG; and 
 
 Utility Gross Margin generated from off-tariff customers, as well as interruptible customers. 
 
 The following provides more information on the components of Utility Gross Margin and associated throughput (Bcf) of natural gas delivered to customers:

 BGSS Incentive Programs 
 
 The factors contributing to the change in Utility Gross Margin generated by BGSS incentive programs are as follows: 
 (Thousands) 2023 v. 2022 Storage 417 Capacity release 208 Off-system sales (192) Total increase 433 
 
 The increase in BGSS incentive programs was due primarily to increased margins from storage incentive market opportunities and higher capacity release values, partially offset by lower off-system sales volumes. 
 
 Other Results 
 
 O M expense increased 28.2M during fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022, due primarily to the deferral of bad debt costs in accordance with the July 2020 BPU deferral order in fiscal 2022 that did not reoccur, as well as an increase in compensation and consulting expenditures. 
 
 Depreciation expense increased 7.7M in fiscal 2023, compared with fiscal 2022, as a result of additional utility plant being placed into service. 
 
 Interest expense increased 10.2M in fiscal 2023, compared with fiscal 2022, due primarily to increased outstanding long-term debt at higher interest rates. 
 
 Other income increased 5.9M during fiscal 2023, compared with fiscal 2022, due primarily to increased AFUDC equity, along with decreased pension and postemployment costs. 
 
 Income taxes decreased 7.1M during fiscal 2023, compared with fiscal 2022, due to lower income before income taxes. 
 
 Net income decreased 8.7M during fiscal 2023, compared with fiscal 2022, due primarily to increased O M, depreciation and interest expenses, partially offset by higher Utility Gross Margin, as previously discussed. 

Clean Energy Ventures 
 
 Overview 
 
 CEV actively pursues opportunities in the renewable energy markets. CEV enters into various agreements to install solar net-metered systems for residential and commercial customers, as well as large commercial grid-connected projects. In addition, CEV enters into various long-term agreements, including PPAs, to supply energy from commercial solar projects. 
 
 Capital expenditures related to clean energy projects are subject to change due to a variety of factors that may affect our ability to commence operations at these projects on a timely basis or at all, including logistics associated with the start-up of residential and commercial solar projects, such as timing of construction schedules, the permitting and regulatory process, any delays related to electric grid interconnection, economic trends, unforeseen events and the ability to access capital or allocation of capital to other investments or business opportunities. CEV is also subject to various risks, which may include impacts to residential solar customer growth and customer collections, our ability to identify and develop commercial solar asset investments, impacts to our supply chain and our ability to source materials for construction. 
 
 The primary contributors toward the value of qualifying clean energy projects are tax incentives and RECs. Changes in the federal statutes related to the ITC and/or relevant state legislation and regulatory policies affecting the market for solar renewable energy credits could significantly affect future results.

 (2) Includes an operational 2.9 MW commercial solar project acquired in December 2020. 
 (3) Includes two operational commercial solar projects acquired in July 2023, totaling 20.7 MW. 
 
 CEV has approximately 468.8 MW of solar capacity in service. Projects that were placed in service through December 31, 2019, qualified for a 30 federal ITC. The credit declined to 26 for property under construction during 2020. In December 2020, the 26 federal ITC was extended through the end of 2022. Following the signing of the Inflation Reduction Act into law in August 2022, the federal ITC was restored to 30 through the end of 2032. There are additional opportunities to increase the credit amount up to 20 for certain facilities that are placed in service after December 31, 2022, based upon the type of project and location. ITC-eligible projects placed in service prior to the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act are not impacted by the change. 
 
 CEV may enter into transactions to sell certain of its commercial solar assets concurrent with agreements to lease the assets back over a period of five to 15 years. The Company will continue to operate the solar assets and is responsible for related expenses and entitled to retain the revenue generated from RECs and energy sales. The ITCs and other tax benefits associated with these solar projects transfer to the buyer if applicable; however, the lease payments are structured so that CEV is compensated for the transfer of the related tax incentives. Accordingly, for solar projects financed under sale leasebacks for which the assets were sold during the first 5 years of in-service life, CEV recognizes the equivalent value of the ITC in other income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the respective five-year ITC recapture periods, starting with the second year of the lease. During fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, CEV received proceeds of 167.8M, 24.1M and 17.7M, respectively, in connection with the sale leaseback of commercial solar assets. 
 
 As part of its solar investment portfolio, CEV operates a residential and small commercial solar program, The Sunlight Advantage , that provides qualifying homeowners and small business owners the opportunity to have a solar system installed at their home or place of business with no installation or maintenance expenses. CEV owns, operates and maintains the system over the life of the contract in exchange for monthly payments. 
 
 For solar installations placed in-service in New Jersey prior to April 30, 2020, each MWh of electricity produced creates an SREC that represents the renewable energy attribute of the solar-electricity generated that can be sold to third parties, predominantly load-serving entities that are required to comply with the solar requirements under New Jersey s renewable portfolio standard. 
 
 Following the close of the SREC market in New Jersey, the BPU established the TREC as the successor program to the SREC program. TRECs provide a fixed compensation base multiplied by an assigned project factor in order to determine their value. The project factor is determined by the type and location of the project, as defined. All TRECs generated are required to be purchased monthly by a TREC program administrator as appointed by the BPU. 
 
 In July 2021, the BPU established a new successor solar incentive program. This Administratively Determined Incentive Program, which we refer to as SREC IIs, provides administratively set incentives for net metered residential projects and net metered non-residential projects of 5 MW or less. 
 
 In December 2022, the BPU established the Competitive Solar Incentive Program, which will serve as the permanent program within the successor solar incentive program and provide incentives to larger solar facilities. It is open to qualifying grid supply solar facilities, non-residential net metered solar installations with a capacity greater than 5MW, and eligible grid supply solar facilities installed in combination with energy storage.

 Income tax benefit increased 19.0M during fiscal 2023, compared with fiscal 2022, due primarily to the reversal of a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets. 
 
 Net income in fiscal 2023 increased 5.1M, compared with fiscal 2022, due primarily to the increased income tax benefit, partially offset by decreased operating revenues and higher depreciation expense, as previously discussed. 

Energy Services 
 
 Overview 
 
 ES markets and sells natural gas to wholesale and retail customers and manages natural gas transportation and storage assets throughout major market areas across North America. ES maintains a strategic portfolio of natural gas transportation and storage contracts that it utilizes in conjunction with its market expertise to provide service and value to its customers. Availability of these transportation and storage contracts allows ES to generate market opportunities by capturing price differentials over specific time horizons and between geographic market locations. 
 
 ES also provides management of transportation and storage assets for natural gas producers and regulated utilities. These management transactions typically involve the release of producer/utility-owned storage and/or transportation capacity in combination with an obligation to either purchase and/or deliver physical natural gas. In addition to the contractual purchase and/or sale of physical natural gas, ES generates or pays fee-based margin in exchange for its active management and may provide the producer and/or utility with additional margin based on actual results. 
 
 In conjunction with the active management of these contracts, ES generates Financial Margin by identifying market opportunities and simultaneously entering into natural gas purchase/sale, storage or transportation contracts and financial derivative contracts. In cases where storage is utilized to fulfill these contracts, these forecast sales and/or purchases are economically hedged through the use of financial derivative contracts. The financial derivative contracts consist primarily of exchange-traded futures, options and swap contracts, and are frequently used to lock in anticipated transactional cash flows and to help manage volatility in natural gas market prices. Generally, when its transportation and storage contracts are exposed to periods of increased market volatility, ES is able to implement strategies that allow it to capture margin by improving the respective time or geographic spreads on a forward basis. 
 
 ES accounts for its physical commodity contracts and its financial derivative instruments at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of physical commodity contracts and financial derivative instruments are included in earnings as a component of operating revenues or natural gas purchases on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Volatility in reported net income at ES can occur over periods of time due to changes in the fair value of derivatives, as well as timing differences related to certain transactions. Unrealized gains and losses can fluctuate as a result of changes in the price of natural gas, SRECs and foreign currency from the original transaction price. Volatility in earnings can also occur as a result of timing differences between the settlement of financial derivatives and the sale of the underlying physical commodity. For example, when a financial instrument settles and the physical natural gas is injected into inventory, the realized gains and losses associated with the financial instrument are recognized in earnings. However, the gains and losses associated with the physical natural gas are not recognized in earnings until the natural gas inventory is withdrawn from storage and sold, at which time ES realizes the entire margin on the transaction. 
 
 During December 2020, ES entered into a series of AMAs with an investment grade public utility to release pipeline capacity associated with certain natural gas transportation contracts. The utility provides certain asset management services, and ES may deliver natural gas to the utility in exchange for aggregate net proceeds of approximately 500M, payable through November 1, 2030. The AMAs include a series of initial and permanent releases, which commenced in November 2021. NJR will receive a total of approximately 260M in cash from fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2024 and 34M per year from fiscal 2025 through fiscal 2031 under the agreements. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, ES recognized 48.5M and 53.0M, respectively, of operating revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amounts received in excess of revenue, totaling 58.7M and 33.8M as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are included in deferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 ES s portfolio of financial derivative instruments is composed of: 
 (in Bcf) 2023 2022 2021 Net short futures and swaps contracts 6.9 0.7 13.7 
 
 During fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 the net short position resulted in unrealized gains (losses) of 16.2M, (8.5)M and (53.5)M, respectively. 
 
 Operating revenues decreased 837.7M and natural gas purchases decreased 835.5M during fiscal 2023, compared with fiscal 2022, due primarily to a 45.2 decrease in natural gas prices, partially offset by periods of volatility in natural gas prices during the first two quarters of fiscal 2023. 
 
 Future results at ES are contingent upon natural gas market price volatility driven by variations in both the supply and demand balances caused by weather and other factors. As a result, variations in weather patterns in the key market areas served may affect earnings during the fiscal year. Changes in market fundamentals, such as an increase in supply and decrease in demand due to warmer temperatures and reduced volatility, can negatively impact ES s earnings. See Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Natural Gas Distribution for TETCO M-3 Daily Prices, which illustrates the daily natural gas prices in the Northeast market region. 
 
 O M expense decreased 19.7M during fiscal 2023, compared with fiscal 2022, due primarily to a reduction in the reserve for bad debt, and decreases in charitable contributions and compensation costs. 
 
 Interest expense increased 6.7M during fiscal 2023, compared with fiscal 2022, due primarily to increased borrowings at higher interest rates. 
 
 Net income increased 9.2M during fiscal 2023, compared with fiscal 2022, due primarily to increased operating income, partially offset by higher interest expense, as previously discussed.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Management uses Financial Margin and NFE, non-GAAP financial measures, when evaluating the operating results of ES. Financial Margin and NFE are based on removing timing differences associated with certain derivative instruments. GAAP also requires us, during the interim periods, to estimate our annual effective tax rate and use this rate to calculate the year-to-date tax provision. We also determine an annual estimated effective tax rate for NFE purposes and calculate a quarterly tax adjustment based on the differences between our forecasted net income and our forecasted NFE for the fiscal year. This adjustment is applied to ES, as the adjustment primarily relates to timing differences associated with certain derivative instruments that impact the estimate of the annual effective tax rate for NFE. No adjustment is needed during the fourth quarter, since the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end. 
 
 Management views these measures as representative of the overall expected economic result and uses these measures to compare ES s results against established benchmarks and earnings targets, as these measures eliminate the impact of volatility on GAAP earnings as a result of timing differences associated with the settlement of derivative instruments. To the extent that there are unanticipated impacts from changes in the market value related to the effectiveness of economic hedges, ES s actual non-GAAP results can differ from the results anticipated at the outset of the transaction. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the comparable GAAP measure. 
 
 When ES reconciles the most directly comparable GAAP measure to both Financial Margin and NFE, the current period unrealized gains and losses on derivatives are excluded as a reconciling item. Financial Margin and NFE also exclude the effects of economic hedging of the value of our natural gas in storage and, therefore, only include realized gains and losses related to natural gas withdrawn from storage, effectively matching the full earnings effects of the derivatives with realized margins on the related physical natural gas flows. Financial Margin differs from gross margin as defined on a GAAP basis, as it excludes certain operations and maintenance expense and depreciation and amortization as well as the effects of derivatives as discussed above. 
 
 Financial Margin 
 
 A reconciliation of gross margin, the closest GAAP financial measure, to ES s Financial Margin is as follows: 
 (Thousands) 2023 2022 2021 Operating revenues 691,616 1,529,272 1,228,420 Less: Natural gas purchases 558,932 1,394,405 1,098,261 Operation and maintenance (1)

 34,699 19,939 (42,405) Financial margin 119,132 94,806 146,116 
 (1) Excludes general and administrative expenses of (0.8)M, 15.4M and 17.6M for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 (2) Includes unrealized losses (gains) related to an intercompany transaction between NJNG and ES that have been eliminated in consolidation of approximately 7.8M, 0.1M and (3.2)M, net of taxes for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 (3) Effects of hedging natural gas inventory transactions where the economic impact is realized in a future period. 
 
 Financial Margin increased 24.3M during fiscal 2023, compared with fiscal 2022, due primarily to higher natural gas price volatility in December 2022 and February 2023, as a result of cold weather in regions where ES had contracted rights to transportation and storage assets.

 Net Financial Earnings 
 
 A reconciliation of ES s net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to NFE, is as follows for the fiscal years ended September 30: 
 (Thousands) 2023 2022 2021 Net income 78,848 69,650 58,957 Add: Unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments and related transactions (48,251) (60,000) 58,362 Tax effect (1)

 (1) Includes taxes related to an intercompany transaction between NJNG and ES that have been eliminated in consolidation of approximately (2.4)M and 1.0M for fiscal 2023 and 2021, respectively. Taxes that were eliminated in consolidation during fiscal 2022 were immaterial. 
 
 NFE increased 29.4M during fiscal 2023, compared with fiscal 2022, due primarily to higher Financial Margin, as previously discussed. 
 
 Future results are subject to ES s ability to expand its wholesale sales and service activities and are contingent upon many other factors, including an adequate number of appropriate and credit-qualified counterparties in an active and liquid natural marketplace; volatility in the natural gas market due to weather or other fundamental market factors impacting supply and/or demand; transportation, storage and/or other market arbitrage opportunities; sufficient liquidity in the overall energy trading market; and continued access to liquidity in the capital markets. 

Storage and Transportation 
 
 Overview 
 
 S T invests in natural gas assets, such as natural gas transportation and storage facilities. We believe that acquiring, owning and developing these storage and transportation assets, which operate under a tariff structure that has either cost- or market-based rates, can provide us a growth opportunity. S T is subject to various risks, including the construction, development and operation of our transportation and storage assets, obtaining necessary governmental, environmental and regulatory approvals, our ability to obtain necessary property rights and our ability to obtain financing at reasonable costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of our assets. 
 
 S T is comprised of Leaf River, a 32.2M Dth salt dome natural gas storage facility that operates under market-based rates, and Adelphia, an existing 84-mile pipeline in southeastern Pennsylvania. Adelphia operates under cost-of-service rates but can enter into negotiated rates with counterparties. The northern portion of the pipeline was operational upon acquisition, and it currently serves two natural gas generation facilities. In October 2020, we began the conversion of the southern zone of the pipeline to natural gas, which became fully operational in September 2022. 
 
 S T also has a 50 ownership interest in Steckman Ridge, a storage facility located in western Pennsylvania that operates under market-based rates. As of September 30, 2023, our investment in Steckman Ridge was 104.1M. 
 
 S T also has a 20 interest in PennEast, a partnership whose purpose was to construct and operate a 120-mile natural gas pipeline that would have extended from northeast Pennsylvania to western New Jersey. PennEast received a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for the project from FERC in January 2018. However, because of numerous regulatory and legal challenges, we evaluated our equity investment in PennEast for impairment during fiscal 2021, and determined that it was other-than-temporarily impaired. We estimated the fair value of our investment in PennEast using probability weighted scenarios assigned to discounted future cash flows. The impairment was the result of management s estimates and assumptions regarding the likelihood of certain outcomes related to required regulatory approvals and pending legal matters, the timing and magnitude of construction costs and in-service dates, the evaluation of the current environmental and political climate as it relates to interstate pipeline development, and transportation capacity revenues and discount rates.

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
 OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 In December 2021, the FERC dismissed PennEast s pending applications. The order vacated the certificate authorization for the PennEast pipeline project in light of PennEast s response to FERC staff s November 2021 request for a status update, in which PennEast informed the Commission it is no longer developing the project. 
 
 During fiscal 2022, the PennEast board of managers approved cash distributions to members of the partnership following the sale of certain project-related assets and refunds of interconnection fees received from interstate pipelines. The return of capital received by the Company, which totaled 11.0M, reduced the remaining carrying value of its equity method investment in PennEast to zero, with the excess recorded in equity in earnings (loss) of affiliates in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company received additional return of capital of 0.3M during fiscal 2023, which is recognized in equity in earnings of affiliates in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 Operating Results 
 
 The financial results of S T for the fiscal years ended September 30, are summarized as follows: 
 (Thousands) 2023 2022 2021 Operating revenues (1) 
 92,859 67,735 51,020 Operating expenses Natural gas purchases 1,601 2,702 1,266 Operation and maintenance 34,648 30,568 29,135 Depreciation and amortization 24,185 12,302 9,960 Total operating expenses 60,434 45,572 40,361 Operating income 32,425 22,163 10,659 Other income, net 6,850 8,546 5,931 Interest expense, net 25,803 12,097 13,348 Income tax provision (benefit) 3,444 1,879 (10,043) Equity in earnings (loss) of affiliates 3,126 9,865 (81,072) Net income (loss) 13,154 26,598 (67,787) 
 (1) Includes related party transactions of approximately 4.2M, 2.4M and 1.8M for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which are eliminated in consolidation. 
 
 Operating revenue increased 25.1M during fiscal 2023, compared with fiscal 2022, due primarily to increased fixed price contract revenue for Adelphia and increased hub services revenue for Leaf River. 
 
 O M expense increased 4.1M during fiscal 2023, compared with fiscal 2022, due primarily to increased property taxes and contractor expenses. 
 
 Depreciation expense increased 11.9M during fiscal 2023, compared with fiscal 2022, due primarily to the southern portion of Adelphia, which was placed in service in September 2022. 
 
 Interest expense increased 13.7M during fiscal 2023, compared with fiscal 2022, due primarily to increased borrowings and higher interest rates. 
 
 Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased 6.7M during fiscal 2023, compared with fiscal 2022, due primarily to a decreased return of capital related to our equity method investment in PennEast, as previously discussed. 
 
 Net income decreased 13.4M during fiscal 2023, compared with fiscal 2022, due primarily to increased O M, depreciation and interest expense, along with decreased equity in earnings of affiliates, partially offset by higher operating revenue, as previously discussed.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Management uses NFE, a non-GAAP financial measure, when evaluating the operating results of S T. Certain transactions associated with equity method investments and their impact, including impairment charges, which are non-cash charges, and the return of capital in excess of the carrying value of our investment, are excluded for NFE purposes. The details of such adjustments can be found in the table below. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP, and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the comparable GAAP measure. 
 
 A reconciliation of S T s net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to NFE, is as follows: 
 (Thousands) 2023 2022 2021 Net income (loss) 13,154 26,598 (67,787) Add: (Gain on) impairment of equity method investment (300) (5,521) 92,000 Tax effect (19) 1,377 (11,167) Net financial earnings 12,835 22,454 13,046 
 
 NFE decreased 9.6M during fiscal 2023, compared with fiscal 2022, due primarily to increased O M, depreciation and interest expense, partially offset by higher operating revenue, as previously discussed. 

Home Services and Other 
 
 Overview 
 
 The financial results of HSO consist primarily of the operating results of NJRHS. NJRHS provides service, sales and installation of appliances to service contract customers and has been focused on growing its installation business and expanding its service contract customer base. HSO also includes organizational expenses incurred at NJR. 
 
 Operating Results 
 
 The condensed financial results of HSO for the fiscal years ended September 30, are summarized as follows: 
 (Thousands) 2023 2022 2021 Operating revenues 57,638 56,182 52,229 Income (loss) before income taxes 3,281 278 (1,022) Income tax (benefit) provision (1,477) 1,059 (196) Net income (loss) 4,758 (781) (826) 
 
 Operating revenues increased 1.5M during fiscal 2023, compared with fiscal 2022, due primarily to increased service contract and installation revenue at NJRHS. 
 
 Net income increased 5.5M during fiscal 2023, compared with fiscal 2022, due primarily to increased revenue, as previously discussed, along with decreased pension costs and increased income tax benefit. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our objective is to maintain an efficient consolidated capital structure that reflects the different characteristics of each reporting segment and other business operations and provides adequate financial flexibility for accessing capital markets as required. Our consolidated capital structure as of September 30, was as follows: 
 2023 2022 Common stock equity 39 38 Long-term debt 54 52 Short-term debt 7 10 Total 100 100 
 
 Page 53 

New Jersey Resources Corporation 
 Part II 
 
 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
 OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 Common Stock Equity 
 
 We satisfy our external common equity requirements, if any, through issuances of our common stock, including the proceeds from stock issuances under our DRP. The DRP allows us, at our option, to use treasury shares or newly issued shares to raise capital. NJR raised approximately 15.0M and 14.7M of equity through the DRP during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. We also raised approximately 42.8M of equity by issuing approximately 948,000 shares through the waiver discount feature of the DRP during fiscal 2023. There were no shares issued through the waiver discount feature during fiscal 2022. 
 
 In 1996, the Board of Directors authorized us to implement a share repurchase program, which has been expanded seven times since the inception of the program, authorizing a total of 19.5M shares of common stock for repurchase. As of September 30, 2023, we had repurchased a total of approximately 17.8M of those shares and may repurchase an additional 1.7M shares under the approved program. There were no shares repurchased during fiscal 2023 and 2022. 

Debt 
 
 NJR and its unregulated subsidiaries generally rely on cash flows generated from operating activities and the utilization of committed credit facilities to provide liquidity to meet working capital and short-term debt financing requirements. NJNG also relies on the issuance of commercial paper for short-term funding. NJR and NJNG, as borrowers, periodically access the capital markets to fund long-life assets through the issuance of long-term debt securities. 
 
 We believe that our existing borrowing availability, equity proceeds and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditures and dividend requirements for at least the next 12 months. NJR, NJNG, CEV, S T and ES currently anticipate that each of their financing requirements for the next 12 months will be met primarily through the issuance of short- and long-term debt, and meter or solar asset sale leasebacks. 
 
 We believe that as of September 30, 2023, NJR and NJNG were, and currently are, in compliance with all existing debt covenants, both financial and non-financial. 
 
 As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, recent geopolitical tensions and inflationary pressures, there has been uncertainty and volatility in the credit and capital markets. We have been able to obtain sufficient financing to meet our funding requirements for operations and capital expenditures; however, our ability to access funds from financial institutions at a reasonable cost in the future may impact the nature and timing of future capital market transactions. 
 
 Short-Term Debt 
 
 We use our short-term borrowings primarily to finance ES s short-term liquidity needs, S T investments, share repurchases and, on an initial basis, CEV s investments. ES s use of high-volume storage facilities and anticipated pipeline park and loan arrangements, combined with related economic hedging activities in the volatile wholesale natural gas market, create significant short-term cash requirements. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, NJR had a revolving credit facility totaling 650M, with 427.0M available under the facility. 
 
 NJNG satisfies its debt needs by issuing short-term and long-term debt based on its financial profile. The seasonal nature of NJNG s operations creates large short-term cash requirements, primarily to finance natural gas purchases and customer accounts receivable. NJNG obtains working capital for these requirements, and for the temporary financing of construction and MGP remediation expenditures and energy tax payments, based on its financial profile, through the issuance of commercial paper supported by the NJNG Credit Facility or through short-term bank loans under the NJNG Credit Facility. 
 
 NJNG s commercial paper is sold through several commercial banks under an issuing and paying agency agreement and is supported by the 250M NJNG Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2023, the unused amount available under the NJNG Credit Facility, including amounts allocated to the backstop under the commercial paper program and the issuance of letters of credit, was 214.5M.

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

 Short-term borrowings were as follows: 
 Twelve Months Ended (Thousands) September 30, 2023 NJR Notes Payable to banks: Balance at end of period 217,300 Weighted average interest rate at end of period 6.53 Average balance for the period 254,932 Weighted average interest rate for average balance 5.78 Month end maximum for the period 465,000 NJNG Commercial Paper and Notes Payable to banks: Balance at end of period 34,800 Weighted average interest rate at end of period 5.48 Average balance for the period 40,685 Weighted average interest rate for average balance 4.82 Month end maximum for the period 111,800 
 
 Due to the seasonal nature of natural gas prices and demand, and because inventory levels are built up during its natural gas injection season (April through October), NJR and NJNG s short-term borrowings tend to peak in the November through January time frame. 
 
 NJR 
 
 On August 30, 2022, NJR entered into a First Amendment to NJR s Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement governing a 650M NJR Credit Facility with a maturity date of September 2, 2027. The NJR Credit Facility is subject to a one-year extension beyond that date and includes an accordion feature, which allows NJR, in the absence of a default or event of default, to increase from time to time, with the existing or new lenders, the revolving credit commitments under the NJR Credit Facility in increments of 50M with the total revolving credit commitments not exceeding 750M. The NJR Credit Facility also permits the borrowing of revolving loans and swingline loans, as well as a 75M sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Certain of NJR s unregulated subsidiaries have guaranteed all of NJR s obligations under the NJR Credit Facility. The credit facility is used primarily to finance its share repurchases, to satisfy ES s short-term liquidity needs and to finance, on an initial basis, unregulated investments. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, NJR had seven letters of credit outstanding totaling 5.7M, which reduced the amount available under the NJR Credit Facility by the same amount. NJR does not anticipate that these letters of credit will be drawn upon by the counterparties. 
 
 In February 2022, NJR entered into a 364-day 150M term loan credit agreement with an interest rate based on SOFR plus 0.85 , that expired on February 7, 2023. The Company borrowed 50M on February 9, 2022 and 100M on February 14, 2022 under the term loan, which was paid in full at expiration of the term loan agreement. 
 
 Based on its average borrowings during fiscal 2023, NJR s average interest rate was 5.78 , resulting in interest expense of approximately 14.3M. Based on average borrowings of 254.9M during the period, a 100 basis point change in the underlying average interest rate would have caused a change in interest expense of approximately 2.6M during fiscal 2023. 
 
 Neither NJNG nor its assets are obligated or pledged to support the NJR Credit Facility. 
 
 NJNG 
 
 On August 30, 2022, NJNG amended the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement governing a 250M NJNG Credit Facility with a maturity date of September 2, 2027. The NJNG Credit Facility is subject to a one-year extension beyond that date and includes an accordion feature, which would allow NJNG, in the absence of a default or event of default, to increase from time to time, with the existing or new lenders, the revolving credit commitments under the NJNG Credit Facility in minimum increments of 50M up to a maximum of 100M. The NJNG Credit Facility also permits the borrowing of revolving loans and swingline loans, as well as a 30M sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit.

 As of September 30, 2023, NJNG had two letters of credit outstanding for 0.7M, which reduced the amount available under the NJNG Credit Facility by the same amount. NJNG does not anticipate that these letters of credit will be drawn upon by the counterparties. 
 
 Based on its average borrowings during fiscal 2023, NJNG s average interest rate was 4.82 , resulting in interest expense of 1.5M. Based on average borrowings of 40.7M during the period, a 100 basis point change in the underlying average interest rate would have caused a change in interest expense of approximately 0.3M during fiscal 2023. 
 
 Short-Term Debt Covenants 
 
 Borrowings under the NJR Credit Facility, term loan credit agreement and NJNG Credit Facility are conditioned upon compliance with a maximum leverage ratio (consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization as defined in the applicable agreements) of not more than .70 to 1.00 for NJR and .65 to 1.00 for NJNG. These revolving credit facilities and term loan credit agreement contain customary representations and warranties for transactions of this type. They also contain customary events of default and certain covenants that will limit NJR s or NJNG s ability, beyond agreed upon thresholds, to, among other things: 
 
 incur additional debt; 
 incur liens and encumbrances; 
 make dispositions of assets; 
 enter into transactions with affiliates; and 
 merge, consolidate, transfer, sell or lease all or substantially all of the borrowers or guarantors assets. 
 
 These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications set forth in the applicable agreements. 
 
 Default Provisions 
 
 The agreements governing our long-term and short-term debt obligations include provisions that, if not complied with, could require early payment or similar actions. Default events include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 
 defaults for non-payment; 
 defaults for breach of representations and warranties; 
 defaults for insolvency; 
 defaults for non-performance of covenants; 
 cross-defaults to other debt obligations of the borrower; and 
 guarantor defaults. 
 
 The occurrence of an event of default under these agreements could result in all loans and other obligations of the borrower becoming immediately due and payable and the termination of the credit facilities or term loan. 
 
 Long-Term Debt 
 
 NJR 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, NJR had the following outstanding: 
 100M of 3.48 senior notes due November 7, 2024; 
 100M of 3.54 senior notes due August 18, 2026; 
 110M of 4.38 senior notes due June 23, 2027; 
 100M of 3.96 senior notes due June 8, 2028; 
 150M of 3.29 senior notes due July 17, 2029; 
 130M of 3.50 senior notes due July 23, 2030; 
 130M of 3.60 senior notes due July 23, 2032; 
 80M of 3.25 senior notes due September 1, 2033; 
 120M of 3.13 senior notes due September 1, 2031; 
 50M of 3.64 senior notes due September 19, 2034; and 
 50M of 6.14 senior notes due December 15, 2032.

 On October 24, 2022, NJR entered into a Note Purchase Agreement, which closed on December 15, 2022, under which NJR issued 50M senior notes at a fixed rate of 6.14 , maturing in 2032. The senior notes are unsecured and guaranteed by certain unregulated subsidiaries of NJR. 
 
 Neither NJNG nor its assets are obligated or pledged to support NJR s long-term debt. 
 
 NJNG 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, NJNG s long-term debt consisted of 1.5B in fixed-rate debt issuances secured by the Mortgage Indenture, with maturities ranging from 2024 to 2061, and 22.9M in finance leases with various maturities ranging from 2024 to 2028. 
 
 On October 24, 2022, NJNG entered into a Note Purchase Agreement under which it sold 125M of its senior notes at an interest rate of 5.47 , maturing in 2052. 
 
 On September 28, 2023, NJNG entered into a Note Purchase Agreement for 100M aggregate principal amount of its senior notes consisting of 50M of 5.56 senior notes due September 28, 2033, which closed on September 28, 2023, and 50M of 5.85 senior notes due October 30, 2053, which closed on October 30, 2023. 
 
 Senior notes are secured by an equal principal amount of NJNG s FMBs issued under NJNG s Mortgage Indenture. 
 
 NJR is not obligated directly or contingently with respect to NJNG s fixed-rate debt issuances. 
 
 Long-Term Debt Covenants and Default Provisions 
 
 The NJR and NJNG long-term debt instruments contain customary representations and warranties for transactions of their type. They also contain customary events of default and certain covenants that will limit NJR or NJNG s ability beyond agreed upon thresholds to, among other things: 
 
 incur additional debt (including a covenant that limits the amount of consolidated total debt of the borrower at the end of a fiscal quarter to 70 for NJR and 65 for NJNG of the consolidated total capitalization of the borrower, as those terms are defined in the applicable agreements, and a covenant limiting priority debt to 20 of the borrower s consolidated total capitalization, as those terms are defined in the applicable agreements); 
 incur liens and encumbrances; 
 make loans and investments; 
 make dispositions of assets; 
 make dividends or restricted payments; 
 enter into transactions with affiliates; and 
 merge, consolidate, transfer, sell or lease substantially all of the borrower s assets. 
 
 The aforementioned covenants are subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications set forth in the applicable note purchase agreements. 
 
 In addition, the FMBs issued by NJNG under the Mortgage Indenture are subject to certain default provisions. Events of Default, as defined in the Mortgage Indenture, consist mainly of: 
 
 failure for 30 days to pay interest when due; 
 failure to pay principal or premium when due and payable; 
 failure to make sinking fund payments when due; 
 failure to comply with any other covenants of the Mortgage Indenture after 30 days written notice from the Trustee; 
 failure to pay or provide for judgments in excess of 30M in aggregate amount within 60 days of the entry thereof; or 
 certain events that are or could be the basis of a bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency or receivership proceeding. 
 
 Upon the occurrence and continuance of such an Event of Default, the Mortgage Indenture, subject to any provisions of law applicable thereto, provides that the Trustee may take possession and conduct the business of NJNG, may sell the trust estate or proceed to foreclose the lien of the Mortgage Indenture. The interest rate on defaulted principal and interest, to the extent permitted by law, on the FMBs issued under the Mortgage Indenture is the rate stated in the applicable supplement or, if no such rate is stated, 6 per annum.

 OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 Sale Leaseback 
 
 NJNG 
 
 NJNG received 8.4M and 17.3M in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, in connection with the sale leaseback of its natural gas meters. These transactions are treated as financing obligations that are paid over the term of the arrangement, and NJNG has the option to purchase the meters back at fair value upon expiration. NJNG continues to evaluate this sale leaseback program based on current market conditions. Natural gas meters are excepted and excluded from the lien on NJNG property under the Mortgage Indenture. There were no natural gas meter sale leasebacks recorded during fiscal 2021. 
 
 CEV 
 
 CEV enters into transactions to sell the commercial solar assets concurrent with agreements to lease the assets back over a period of five to 15 years. These transactions are considered failed sale leasebacks for accounting purposes and are therefore treated as financing obligations, which are typically secured by the renewable energy facility asset and its future cash flows from RECs and energy sales. ITCs and other tax benefits associated with these solar projects are transferred to the buyer, if applicable; however, the lease payments are structured so that CEV is compensated for the transfer of the related tax incentives. CEV continues to operate the solar assets, including related expenses, and retain the revenue generated from RECs and energy sales, and has the option to renew the lease or repurchase the assets sold at the end of the lease term. During fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, CEV received proceeds of 167.8M, 24.1M and 17.7M, respectively, in connection with the sale leaseback of commercial solar projects. The proceeds received were recognized as a financing obligation on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Contractual Obligations and Capital Expenditures 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, there were NJR guarantees covering approximately 192.3M of natural gas purchases and ES demand fee commitments and nine outstanding letters of credit totaling 6.4M, as previously mentioned, not yet reflected in accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 Estimated capital expenditures are reviewed on a regular basis and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental regulations, unforeseen events and the ability to access capital. 
 
 NJNG s total capital expenditures spent or accrued during fiscal 2023 were 394.6M. During fiscal 2024 capital expenditures are projected to be between 387M and 440M. NJNG expects to fund its obligations with a combination of cash flows from operations, cash on hand, issuance of commercial paper, available capacity under its revolving credit facility and the issuance of long-term debt. As of September 30, 2023, NJNG s future MGP expenditures are estimated to be 169.4M. For a more detailed description of MGP expenditures, see Note 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 During fiscal 2023, S T had capital expenditures spent or accrued for the Adelphia project totaling 18.8M, and capital expenditures spent or accrued for Leaf River totaling 12.2M. During fiscal 2024, we expect expenditures related to the Adelphia project to be between 8M and 12M and expenditures related to Leaf River to be between 25M and 35M. 
 
 During fiscal 2023, total capital expenditures spent or accrued related to the purchase and installation of solar equipment were 110.4M. CEV s expenditures include clean energy projects that support our goal to promote renewable energy. Accordingly, CEV enters into agreements to install solar equipment involving both residential and commercial projects. We estimate solar-related capital expenditures for projects placed in service during fiscal 2024 to be between 140M and 204M. 
 
 Capital expenditures related to clean energy projects are subject to change due to a variety of factors that may affect our ability to commence operations at these projects on a timely basis or at all, including sourcing projects that meet our investment criteria, logistics associated with the start-up of residential and commercial solar projects, such as timing of construction schedules, the permitting and regulatory process, any delays related to electric grid interconnection, economic trends or unforeseen events and the ability to access capital or allocation of capital to other investments or business opportunities. 
 
 ES does not currently anticipate any significant capital expenditures during fiscal 2024 and 2025.

 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF 
 OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 During December 2020, ES entered into a series of AMAs with an investment grade public utility to release pipeline capacity associated with certain natural gas transportation contracts. The utility provides certain asset management services, and ES may deliver natural gas to the utility in exchange for aggregate net proceeds of approximately 500M, payable through November 1, 2030. The AMAs include a series of initial and permanent releases which commenced in November 2021. NJR will receive a total of approximately 260M in cash from fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2024 and 34M per year from fiscal 2025 through fiscal 2031 under the agreements. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, ES recognized 48.5M and 53.0M, respectively, of operating revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amounts received in excess of revenue, totaling 58.7M and 33.8M as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are included in deferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Cash Flows 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2023 totaled 479.0M compared with 323.5M during fiscal 2022. Operating cash flows are primarily affected by variations in working capital, which can be impacted by several factors, including: 
 
 seasonality of our business; 
 fluctuations in wholesale natural gas prices and other energy prices, including changes in derivative asset and liability values; 
 timing of storage injections and withdrawals; 
 the deferral and recovery of natural gas costs; 
 changes in contractual assets utilized to optimize margins related to natural gas transactions; 
 broker margin requirements; 
 impact of unusual weather patterns on our wholesale business; 
 timing of the collections of receivables and payments of current liabilities; 
 volumes of natural gas purchased and sold; and 
 timing of SREC deliveries. 
 
 The increase of 155.5M in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2023, compared with fiscal 2022, was due primarily to decreased working capital requirements related to the decline in natural gas prices. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Cash flows used in investing activities totaled 538.6M during fiscal 2023, compared with 590.6M during fiscal 2022. The decrease of 52.0M was due primarily to lower capital expenditures for S T related to the conversion of the southern portion of Adelphia s pipeline to natural gas, which was placed into service during September 2022, along with decreased solar asset expenditures, partially offset by increased utility plant expenditures. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Financing cash flows generally are seasonal in nature and are impacted by the volatility in pricing in the natural gas and other energy markets. NJNG s inventory levels are built up during its natural gas injection season (April through October) and reduced during withdrawal season (November through March) in response to the supply requirements of its customers. Changes in financing cash flows can also be impacted by natural gas management and marketing activities at ES and clean energy investments at CEV. 
 
 Cash flows from financing activities totaled 59.7M during fiscal 2023, compared with 262.5M during fiscal 2022. The decrease of 202.8M is due primarily to the repayment of the term loan of 150.0M that was borrowed during fiscal 2022, decreased long-term debt proceeds of 135.0M, partially offset by an increase in proceeds of 143.7M from solar sale leasebacks, a decrease in payments of short-term debt of 81.5M and an increase of 42.8M from the waiver discount issuance of common stock.

 Credit Ratings 
 
 The table below summarizes NJNG s credit ratings as of September 30, 2023, issued by two rating entities, Moody s and Fitch: 
 Moody s 
 Fitch Corporate Rating N/A A- Commercial Paper P-2 F-2 Senior Secured A1 A+ Ratings Outlook Stable Stable 
 
 The Fitch ratings and outlook were reaffirmed on April 24, 2023. The Moody s ratings and outlook were reaffirmed on September 29, 2023. NJNG s Moody s and Fitch ratings are investment-grade ratings. NJR is not rated by Moody s or Fitch. 
 
 Although NJNG is not party to any lending agreements that would accelerate the maturity date of any obligation caused by a failure to maintain any specific credit rating, if such ratings are downgraded below investment grade, borrowing costs could increase, as would the costs of maintaining certain contractual relationships, and future financing and our access to capital markets would be reduced. Even if ratings are downgraded without falling below investment grade, NJR and NJNG could face increased borrowing costs under their credit facilities. A rating set forth above is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold NJR s or NJNG s securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time. Each rating set forth above should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 
 
 The timing and mix of any external financings will target a common equity ratio that is consistent with maintaining NJNG s current short-term and long-term credit ratings. 

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Financial Risk Management 

Commodity Market Risks 
 
 Natural gas is a nationally traded commodity. Its prices are determined effectively by the NYMEX, ICE and over-the-counter markets. The prices on the NYMEX, CME, ICE and over-the-counter markets generally reflect the national balance of natural gas supply and demand, but are also significantly influenced from time to time by other events. 
 
 Our regulated and unregulated businesses are subject to market risk due to fluctuations in the price of natural gas. To economically hedge against such fluctuations, we have entered into forwards, futures, options and swap agreements. To manage these derivative instruments, we have well-defined risk management policies and procedures that include daily monitoring of volumetric limits and monetary guidelines. Our natural gas businesses are conducted through two of our operating subsidiaries. NJNG is a regulated utility that uses futures, options and swaps to provide relative price stability, and its recovery of natural gas costs is governed by the BPU. ES uses futures, options, swaps and physical contracts to economically hedge purchases and sales of natural gas. 
 
 The following table reflects the changes in the fair market value of financial derivatives related to natural gas purchases and sales: 
 Balance Increase Less Balance (Thousands) September 30, 2022 (Decrease) in Fair Market Value Amounts Settled September 30, 2023 NJNG (6,196) (27,752) (40,038) 6,090 ES (6,686) 83,704 60,840 16,178 Total (12,882) 55,952 20,802 22,268

 Our market price risk is predominately linked with changes in the price of natural gas at the Henry Hub, the delivery point for the NYMEX natural gas futures contracts. Based on price sensitivity analysis, an illustrative 10 movement in the natural gas futures contract price, for example, increases (decreases) the reported derivative fair value of all open, unadjusted Henry Hub natural gas futures and fixed price swap positions by approximately 3.6M. This analysis does not include potential changes to reported credit adjustments embedded in the 14.4M reported fair value.

Wholesale Credit Risk 
 
 The following is a summary of gross and net credit exposures, grouped by investment and non-investment grade counterparties, as of September 30, 2023. Gross credit exposure for ES is defined as the unrealized fair value of derivative and energy trading contracts, plus any outstanding wholesale receivable for the value of natural gas or power delivered and/or financial derivative commodity contract that has settled for which payment has not yet been received. Gross credit exposure for S T is defined as demand and estimated usage fees for contracted services and/or market value of loan balances for which payment has not yet been received. Net credit exposure is defined as gross credit exposure reduced by collateral received from counterparties and/or payables, where netting agreements exist. The amounts presented in the next tables exclude accounts receivable for NJNG retail natural gas sales and services.

 ES s, CEV s and S T s counterparty credit exposure as of September 30, 2023, is as follows: 
 (Thousands) Gross Credit Exposure Net Credit Exposure Investment grade 105,765 102,746 Noninvestment grade 4,548 372 Internally-rated investment grade 19,549 18,802 Internally-rated noninvestment grade 19,897 16,850 Total 149,759 138,770

 Due to the inherent volatility in the market price for natural gas, electricity and SRECs, the market value of contractual positions with individual counterparties could exceed established credit limits or collateral provided by those counterparties. If a counterparty failed to perform the obligations under its contract (for example, failed to make payment for natural gas received), we could sustain a loss. This loss would comprise the loss on natural gas delivered but not paid for and/or the cost of replacing natural gas not delivered or received at a price that exceeds the original contract price. Any such loss could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Effects of Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Rate Fluctuations 
 
 We are also exposed to changes in interest rates on our debt hedges, variable rate debt and changes in foreign currency rates for our business conducted in Canada using Canadian dollars. We do not believe an immediate 10 increase or decrease in interest rates or foreign currency rates would have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows. 
 
 Information regarding NJR s interest rate risk can be found in the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt section of Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . 
 
 Effects of Inflation 
 
 Any change in price levels has an effect on operating results due to the capital-intensive and regulated nature of our utility subsidiary. The Company s operations are sensitive to increases in the rate of inflation because of its operational and capital spending requirements in both its regulated and non-regulated businesses. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through cost control, productivity improvements and regulatory actions, when appropriate. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information related to the impact of recent increases in inflation rates.

MANAGEMENT S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 
 Management of New Jersey Resources Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s Management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that: 
 
 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 
 
 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 
 
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of September 30, 2023, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 The conclusion of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer is based on the recognition that there are inherent limitations in all systems of internal control over financial reporting. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements, errors or fraud. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 The Company s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte Touche LLP, has issued its report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, which appears herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Shareowners and the Board of Directors of New Jersey Resources Corporation: 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of New Jersey Resources Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, common stock equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 21, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Regulation Impact of Rate-Regulation on Various Account Balances and Disclosures Refer to Notes 2 and 4 to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 New Jersey Natural Gas Company NJNG ), a subsidiary of the Company, is a regulated gas distribution company that serves customers in central and northern New Jersey. NJNG is subject to regulation by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (the BPU ), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates of gas distribution companies in New Jersey. Management has determined NJNG meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the ASC 980, Regulated Operations. 
 
 Page 64 

New Jersey Resources Corporation 
 Part II 
 
 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (Continued) 

 NJNG is subject to cost-based regulation; therefore, it is permitted to recover authorized operating expenses and earn a reasonable return on its utility capital investments based on the BPU s approval. The impact of the ratemaking process and decisions authorized by the BPU allows NJNG to capitalize or defer certain costs that are expected to be recovered from its customers as regulatory assets, and to recognize certain obligations representing amounts that are probable future expenditures as regulatory liabilities in accordance with accounting guidance applicable to regulated operations. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. Decisions to be made by the BPU in the future will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable costs and return on invested capital included in rates and any refunds that may be required. 
 
 Accounting for the economics of rate-regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as regulated property, plant, and equipment, regulatory assets and liabilities, operating revenues and depreciation expense. While NJNG expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the BPU will not approve full recovery of such costs or full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. We identified the impact of rate-regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about the impact of regulatory orders on the financial statements, including assessing the probability of both recovery in rates of incurred costs, and refunds to customers. Given that management s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the BPU, auditing these judgments requires specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty around the impact of regulatory orders on the financial statements, including the probability of both recovery in rates of incurred costs, and refunds to customers, included the following, among others: 
 
 We tested the effectiveness of controls over the relevant regulatory account balances and disclosures, including management s controls over the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the probability of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates due to refunds to customers. 
 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the BPU for NJNG and other public utilities in New Jersey, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by interveners, and other publicly available information to assess the probability of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedence of the BPU s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared that to management s assertions regarding the probability of recovery or refund of regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. 
 We obtained an analysis from management regarding the probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities in order to assess management s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates. 
 We evaluated the Company s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.

 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of New Jersey Resources Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023, of the Company and our report dated November 21, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

MW or less. RECs generated through the production of electricity under this program are known as SREC IIs. 
 
 TRECs and SREC IIs generated are required to be purchased monthly by a REC program administrator as appointed by the BPU. Revenue is recognized when RECs are generated and are transferred monthly based upon metered solar electricity activity. 
 
 Revenues for ES are recognized when the natural gas is physically delivered to the customer. In addition, changes in the fair value of derivatives that economically hedge the forecasted sales of the natural gas are recognized in operating revenues as they occur. ES also recognizes changes in the fair value of SREC derivative contracts as a component of operating revenues. 
 
 During December 2020, ES entered into a series of AMAs with an investment grade public utility to release pipeline capacity associated with certain natural gas transportation contracts, which commenced in November 2021. The AMAs include a series of temporary and permanent releases, and revenue under these agreements is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied. For temporary releases of pipeline capacity, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the agreed-upon term. For permanent releases of pipeline capacity, which represent a transfer of contractual rights for such capacity, revenue is recognized upon the transfer of the underlying contractual rights. ES recognized M and M of operating revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Operations during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.

 Long-lived Assets 
 
 The Company reviews the recoverability of long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, such as significant adverse changes in regulation, business climate or market conditions, including prolonged periods of adverse commodity and capacity prices. If there are changes indicating that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable, an undiscounted cash flows test is performed. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized by reducing the recorded value of the asset to its fair value. Factors that the Company analyzes in determining whether an impairment in its long-lived assets exists include: a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset; a significant adverse change in the extent in which a long-lived asset is being used in its physical condition; legal proceedings or other contributing factors; significant business climate changes; accumulations of costs in significant excess of the amounts expected; a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of such events; and current expectations that more likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, there were no events or circumstances that indicated that the carrying value of long-lived assets or finite-lived intangibles was not recoverable.

 Deferred Income Taxes 
 
 Upon adoption of a 1993 provision of ASC 740, Income Taxes , NJNG recognized a transition adjustment and corresponding regulatory asset representing the difference between NJNG s existing deferred tax amounts compared with the deferred tax amounts calculated in accordance with the change in method prescribed by ASC 740. NJNG recovers the regulatory asset associated with these tax impacts through future base rates, without interest.

 BGSS and CIP 
 
 BGSS rates are normally revised on an annual basis. In addition, to manage the fluctuations in wholesale natural gas costs, NJNG has the ability to make interim filings during each fiscal year to increase residential and small commercial customer BGSS rates on a self-implementing and provisional basis. NJNG is also permitted to refund or credit back a portion of the commodity costs to customers at any time given notice when the natural gas commodity costs decrease in comparison to amounts projected or to amounts previously collected from customers. Concurrent with the annual BGSS filing, NJNG files for an annual review of its CIP. NJNG s annual BGSS and CIP filings are summarized as follows: 
 
 In November 2020, NJNG notified the BPU of its intent to provide BGSS bill credits to residential and small commercial sales customers effective December 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. In December 2020, NJNG notified the BPU of the extension of the BGSS bill credits through January 2021. The actual bill credits given to customers totaled M, M net of tax. 
 
 2021 BGSS/CIP filing In May 2021, NJNG submitted to the BPU the annual petition to modify its BGSS, balancing charge and CIP rates. In November 2021, the BPU approved a M increase to the annual revenues credited to BGSS and a M annual increase related to its balancing charge, as well as changes to CIP rates, which will result in a M decrease to the annual recovery, effective December 1, 2021. 
 
 In November 2021, the BPU approved, on a preliminary basis, NJNG s annual petition to modify its BGSS, balancing charge and CIP rates for residential and small commercial customers. The rate changes resulted in a M increase to the annual revenues credited to BGSS and a M annual increase related to its balancing charge, as well as changes to CIP rates, which resulted in a M annual recovery decrease, effective December 1, 2021, and was approved on a final basis in May 2022. 
 
 In November 2021, NJNG submitted notification of its intent to self-implement an increase to its BGSS rate which results in an approximate M increase to annual revenues credited to BGSS, effective December 1, 2021. 
 
 2022 BGSS/CIP filing In June 2022, NJNG submitted its annual petition to modify its BGSS, balancing charge and CIP rates for residential and small commercial customers. In September 2022, the BPU approved, on a preliminary basis, an M increase to the annual revenues credited to BGSS and a M annual increase related to its balancing charge, as well as a M increase to CIP rates, effective October 1, 2022, which was approved on a final basis on April 12, 2023.

 2023 BGSS/CIP filing On June 1, 2023, NJNG filed its annual petition to modify its BGSS, balancing charge and CIP rates for residential and small business customers. This includes a M decrease to the annual revenues credited to BGSS, a M annual decrease related to its balancing charge and a M increase to CIP rates, effective October 1, 2023. On September 18, 2023, the BPU approved, on a provisional basis, the filed BGSS and balancing charge changes and a M increase to CIP rates, based on updated information since the initial filing. 
 
 BGSS Incentive Programs 
 
 NJNG is eligible to receive financial incentives for reducing BGSS costs through a series of Utility Gross Margin-sharing programs that include off-system sales, capacity release and storage incentive programs. The Company is permitted to annually propose a process to evaluate and discuss alternative incentive programs, should performance of the existing incentives or market conditions warrant re-evaluation. 
 
 Energy Efficiency Programs 
 
 SAVEGREEN conducts home energy audits and provides various grants, incentives and financing alternatives, which are designed to encourage the installation of high efficiency heating and cooling equipment and other upgrades to promote energy efficiency to its residential and commercial customers while stimulating state and local economies through the creation of jobs. Depending on the specific initiative or approval, NJNG recovers costs associated with the programs over a three - to period through a tariff rider mechanism.

 Infrastructure Programs 
 
 NJNG has significant annual capital expenditures associated with the management of its natural gas distribution and transmission system, including new utility plant for customer growth and its associated PIM and infrastructure programs. NJNG continues to implement BPU-approved infrastructure projects that are designed to enhance the reliability of NJNG s natural gas distribution system, including SAFE and NJ RISE. 
 
 SAFE/NJ RISE 
 
 The SAFE program replaced portions of NJNG s natural gas distribution unprotected steel, cast iron infrastructure and associated services to improve the safety and reliability of the natural gas distribution system. SAFE I was approved to invest up to M, exclusive of AFUDC, over a period. SAFE II was approved to invest up to M, excluding AFUDC, over a period. NJNG recovered approximately M through annual rate filings, with the remainder recovered through subsequent rate cases. As a condition of approval of the program, NJNG was required to file a base rate case no later than November 2019 and satisfied this requirement with its March 29, 2019 base rate case filing. 
 
 NJ RISE consisted of capital investment projects estimated to cost M over a period, excluding AFUDC, for natural gas distribution storm-hardening and mitigation projects, along with incremental depreciation expense. NJ RISE includes a weighted average cost of capital that ranges from to and a return on equity of . Requests for recovery of future NJ RISE capital costs occurred in conjunction with SAFE II.

 ES utilizes financial derivatives to economically hedge the gross margin associated with the purchase of physical natural gas to be used for storage injection and its subsequent sale at a later date. The gains or (losses) on the financial transactions that are economic hedges of the cost of the purchased natural gas are recognized prior to the gains or (losses) on the physical transaction, which are recognized in earnings when the natural gas is delivered. Therefore, mismatches between the timing of the recognition of realized gains or (losses) on the financial derivative instruments and gains or (losses) associated with the actual sale of the natural gas that is being economically hedged, along with fair value changes in derivative instruments, creates volatility in the results of ES, although the Company s intended economic results relating to the entire transaction are unaffected.

 Conversely, certain of NJNG s and ES s derivative instruments are linked to agreements containing provisions that would require cash collateral payments from the Company if certain events occur. These provisions vary based upon the terms in individual counterparty agreements and can result in cash payments if NJNG s credit rating were to fall below its current level. Specifically, most, but not all, of these additional payments will be triggered if NJNG s debt is downgraded by the major credit agencies, regardless of investment grade status. In addition, some of these agreements include threshold amounts that would result in additional collateral payments if the values of derivative liabilities were to exceed the maximum values provided for in relevant counterparty agreements. Other provisions include payment features that are not specifically linked to ratings, but are based on certain financial metrics. 
 
 Collateral amounts associated with any of these conditions are determined based on a sliding scale and are contingent upon the degree to which the Company s credit rating and/or financial metrics deteriorate, and the extent to which liability amounts exceed applicable threshold limits. There was approximately M and M of derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position for which collateral is required as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These amounts differ from the respective net derivative liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets because the agreements also include clauses, commonly known as Rights of Offset, that would permit the Company to offset its derivative assets against its derivative liabilities for determining additional collateral to be posted, as previously discussed.

Financial derivative portfolios of NJNG and ES consist mainly of futures, options and swaps. The Company primarily uses the market approach, and its policy is to use actively quoted market prices when available. The principal market for its derivative transactions is the natural gas wholesale market; therefore, the primary sources for its price inputs are CME, NYMEX and ICE. ES uses Platts and Natural Gas Exchange for Canadian delivery points. However, ES also engages in transactions that result in transporting natural gas to delivery points for which there is no actively quoted market price. In most instances, the transportation cost to the final delivery location is not significant to the overall valuation. If required, ES s policy is to use the best information available to determine fair value based on internal pricing models, which would include estimates extrapolated from broker quotes or other pricing services. 
 
 The Company also has other financial assets that include listed equities, mutual funds and money market funds for which there are active exchange quotes available. When the Company determines fair values, measurements are adjusted, as needed, for credit risk associated with its counterparties, as well as its own credit risk. The Company determines these adjustments by using historical default probabilities that correspond to the applicable S P issuer ratings, while also taking into consideration collateral and netting arrangements that serve to mitigate risk.

trusteed, noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans covering eligible regular represented and non-represented employees with more than of service. Defined benefit plan benefits are based on years of service and average compensation during the highest consecutive months of employment. The Company also provides postemployment medical and life insurance benefits to employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. 
 
 All represented employees of NJRHS hired on or after October 1, 2000, non-represented employees hired on or after October 1, 2009 and NJNG represented employees hired on or after January 1, 2012 are covered by an enhanced defined contribution plan instead of the defined benefit plan. Participation in the postemployment medical and life insurance plan was also frozen to new employees as of the same dates, with the exception of new NJRHS represented employees, for which benefits were frozen beginning April 3, 2012. 
 
 The Company maintains an unfunded nonqualified PEP that was established to provide employees with the full level of benefits as stated in the qualified plan without reductions due to various limitations imposed by the provisions of federal income tax laws and regulations. There are no plan assets in the nonqualified plan due to the nature of the plan. 
 
 The Company s funding policy for its pension plans is to contribute at least the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Company had no minimum funding requirements and did make any discretionary contributions to the pension plans. The Company does not expect to be required to make additional contributions to fund the pension plans during the next fiscal year based on current actuarial assumptions; however, funding requirements are uncertain and can depend significantly on changes in actuarial assumptions, returns on plan assets and changes in the demographics of eligible employees and covered dependents. 
 
 There are no federal requirements to pre-fund OPEB benefits. However, the Company is required to fund certain amounts due to regulatory agreements with the BPU. The Company contributed M and M in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, and estimates that it will contribute between M and M over each of the next five years. Additional contributions may be required based on market conditions and changes to assumptions.

 The Company s U.S. federal income tax returns through fiscal 2019 have either been reviewed by the IRS, or the related statute of limitations has expired and all matters have been settled. U.S. federal income tax returns for periods subsequent to fiscal 2019 are open to examination by the IRS. For all periods subsequent to those ended September 30, 2019, the Company s state income tax returns are statutorily open to examination in all applicable states with the exception of Colorado, New Jersey and Texas.

 NJR evaluates its tax positions to determine the appropriate accounting and recognition of potential future obligations associated with uncertain tax positions. A tax benefit claimed, or expected to be claimed, on a tax return may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be upheld upon examination by the applicable taxing authority and is measured based on the largest tax benefit that is more than 50 likely to be realized. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, are recognized within income tax expense, and accrued interest and penalties are recognized within other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 CARES Act 
 
 On March 27, 2020, the President of the U.S. signed the CARES Act, which is aimed at providing emergency assistance and health care for individuals, families, and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and generally supporting the U.S. economy. The CARES Act provided for the delay in the required deposit of the employer portion of the OASDI payroll tax from the date of enactment through the end of 2020. Of the taxes that the Company can defer, 50 of the deferred taxes were required to be deposited by the end of 2021 and the remaining 50 were required to be deposited by the end of 2022. 
 
 As of September 30, 2021, the Company deferred approximately M related to the employer portion of the OASDI tax. During fiscal 2022, the Company made the first of two installment payments, which reduced the balance to approximately M. The second installment payment was made during the first quarter of fiscal 2023, which reduced the balance to as of September 30, 2023.

The Inflation Reduction Act imposes a 15 minimum tax rate on corporations with higher than 1B of annual income, along with a 1 excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. The Inflation Reduction Act raised the ITC from 26 to 30 through the end of 2032, dropping to 26 for property under construction before the end of 2033 and to 22 for property under construction before the end of 2034.

 The impairment of the equity method investment in PennEast created net capital loss attributes totaling approximately M, which could only be utilized to offset capital gains income and carried back three years and forward five years prior to expiration. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company determined that the tax losses created by the impairment may qualify as an ordinary loss, rather than a capital loss. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had a valuation allowance of approximately M and M, respectively. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, the Company evaluated certain tax benefits recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements and concluded that a portion of the tax benefits are uncertain at this time. As a result, the Company recorded a reserve for uncertain tax benefits. 
 Additions based on tax positions related to the current fiscal period Balance at September 30, 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, there are M of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect the annual effective tax rate. The tax benefits relate to fiscal tax years open to examination by the IRS and the state of Pennsylvania and may be subject to subsequent adjustment. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company has state income tax net operating losses of approximately M and M, respectively. These state net operating losses have varying carry-forward periods dictated by the state in which they were incurred; these state carry-forward periods range from seven to years, with the majority expiring after 2037. The Company expects to utilize this entire carryforward, other than as described below. 
 
 As of September 30, 2022, the Company had a valuation allowance of approximately M related to the recognition of state net operating loss carryforwards. As of September 30, 2023, it was determined that the realization of certain deferred tax assets was more likely than not, and thus the associated valuation allowance of approximately M was no longer required. Reversal of the valuation allowance resulted in a corresponding income tax benefit on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of September 30, 2023, the remaining valuation allowance of approximately M related primarily to other state income tax attributes which the Company could not conclude were realizable on a more-likely-than-not basis. 
 
 The Consolidated Appropriations Act extended the 30 ITC for solar property that is under construction on or before December 31, 2019. Projects placed in service after December 31, 2019, may also qualify for a 30 federal ITC if 5 or more of the total costs of a solar property are incurred before the end of the applicable year and there are continuous efforts to advance toward completion of the project, based on the IRS guidance around ITC safe harbor determination. The credit declined to for property under construction before the end of 2020. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 extended the tax credit for property under construction during 2021 and 2022.

 M to M. NJNG s estimate of these liabilities is based upon known facts, existing technology and enacted laws and regulations in place when the review was completed. Where it is probable that costs will be incurred, and the information is sufficient to establish a range of possible liability, NJNG accrues the most likely amount in the range. If no point within the range is more likely than the other, it is NJNG s policy to accrue the lower end of the range. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2023, NJNG recorded a MGP remediation liability and a corresponding regulatory asset of approximately M on the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the most likely amount. The actual costs to be incurred by NJNG are dependent upon several factors, including final determination of remedial action, changing technologies and governmental regulations, the ultimate ability of other responsible parties to pay and insurance recoveries, if any. 
 
 NJNG recovers its remediation expenditures, including carrying costs, over rolling periods pursuant to a RAC approved by the BPU. In March 2022, the BPU approved an increase in the RAC, which increased the pre-tax annual recovery from M to M, effective April 1, 2022. On April 12, 2023, the BPU approved on a final basis NJNG s annual SBC filing of RAC expenditures through June 30, 2022, as well as an increase to the RAC annual recoveries of M, which increased the pre-tax annual recovery to M, effective May 1, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, M of previously incurred remediation costs, net of recoveries from customers and insurance proceeds, are included in regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. NJNG will continue to seek recovery of MGP-related costs through the RAC. If any future regulatory position indicates that the recovery of such costs is not probable, the related non-recoverable costs would be charged to income in the period of such determination. 
 
 General 
 
 The Company is involved, and from time to time in the future may be involved, in a number of pending and threatened judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings relating to matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation matters, particularly when such matters are in their early stages or where the claimants seek indeterminate damages, the Company cannot state with confidence what the eventual outcome of the pending litigation will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be, or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter will be, if any. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company establishes accruals for litigation for those matters that present loss contingencies as to which it is both probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company also discloses contingent matters for which there is a reasonable possibility of a loss. Based upon currently available information, the Company believes that the results of litigation that are currently pending, taken together, will not have a materially adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The actual results of resolving the pending litigation matters may be substantially higher than the amounts accrued. 
 
 The foregoing statements about the Company s litigation are based upon the Company s judgments, assumptions and estimates and are necessarily subjective and uncertain. The Company has a number of threatened and pending litigation matters at various stages.

 Less: Unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments and related transactions ) ) Tax effect ) Effects of economic hedging related to natural gas inventory ) Tax effect ) ) (Gain on) impairment of equity method investment ) ) Tax effect ) ) Net income 
 
 The Company uses derivative instruments as economic hedges of purchases and sales of physical natural gas inventory. For GAAP purposes, these derivatives are recorded at fair value and related changes in fair value are included in reported earnings. Revenues and cost of natural gas related to physical natural gas flow are recognized when the natural gas is delivered to customers. Consequently, there is a mismatch in the timing of earnings recognition between the economic hedges and physical natural gas flows. Timing differences occur in two ways: 
 
 unrealized gains and losses on derivatives are recognized in reported earnings in periods prior to physical natural gas inventory flows; and 
 
 unrealized gains and losses of prior periods are reclassified as realized gains and losses when derivatives are settled in the same period as physical natural gas inventory movements occur. 
 
 NFE is a measure of the earnings based on eliminating these timing differences, to effectively match the earnings effects of the economic hedges with the physical sale of natural gas, SRECs and foreign currency contracts. Consequently, to reconcile between net income and NFE, current-period unrealized gains and losses on the derivatives are excluded from NFE as a reconciling item. Realized derivative gains and losses are also included in current-period net income. However, NFE includes only realized gains and losses related to natural gas sold out of inventory, effectively matching the full earnings effects of the derivatives with realized margins on physical natural gas flows. NFE also excludes certain transactions associated with equity method investments, including impairment charges, which are non-cash charges, and return of capital in excess of the carrying value of our investment. These are considered unusual in nature and occur infrequently such that they are not indicative of the Company s performance for its ongoing operations. Included in the tax effects are current and deferred income tax expense corresponding with the components of NFE.

NEW JERSEY RESOURCES CORPORATION 
 DODD-FRANK CLAWBACK POLICY 
 The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee (the LDCC of the Board of Directors (the Board of New Jersey Resources Corporation (the Company has adopted the following Dodd-Frank Clawback Policy (this Policy ), effective as of October 2, 2023 (the Effective Date ). The LDCC also has adopted a Supplemental Clawback Policy that supersedes and replaces the New Jersey Resources Corporation Compensation Recoupment Policy effective November 12, 2019 (the Supplemental Clawback Policy ). 
 1. Purpose . The purpose of this Policy is to provide for the recoupment of certain incentive compensation pursuant to Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, in the manner required by Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), Rule 10D-1 promulgated thereunder, and the Listing Standards (as defined below) (collectively, the Dodd-Frank Rules ). 
 2. Administration . This Policy shall be administered by the LDCC. Any determinations made by the LDCC shall be final and binding on all affected individuals. 
 3. Definitions . For purposes of this Policy, the following capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth below. 
 (a) Accounting Restatement shall mean an accounting restatement of the Company s financial statements due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement (i) to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements i.e., a Big R restatement), or (ii) that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period i.e., a little r restatement). 
 (b) Affiliate shall mean each entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Company. 
 (c) Clawback Eligible Incentive Compensation shall mean Incentive-Based Compensation Received by a Covered Executive (i) on or after the Effective Date, (ii) after beginning service as a Covered Executive, (iii) if such individual served as a Covered Executive at any time during the performance period for such Incentive-Based Compensation (irrespective of whether such individual continued to serve as a Covered Executive upon or following the Restatement Trigger Date), (iv) while the Company has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association, and (v) during the applicable Clawback Period. For the avoidance of doubt, Incentive-Based Compensation Received by a Covered Executive on or after the Effective Date could, by the terms of this Policy, include amounts approved, awarded, or granted prior to such date. 
 (d) Clawback Period shall mean, with respect to any Accounting Restatement, the three completed fiscal years of the Company immediately preceding the Restatement Trigger Date and any transition period (that results from a change in the Company s fiscal year) within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years (except that a transition period between the last day of the Company s previous fiscal year end and the first day of its new fiscal year that comprises a period of at least nine months shall count as a completed fiscal year). 
 (e) Company Group shall mean the Company and its Affiliates. 
 (f) Covered Executive shall mean any executive officer of the Company as defined under the Dodd-Frank Rules and, for the avoidance of doubt, includes each individual identified as an officer of the Company in accordance with Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act. 
 (g) Erroneously Awarded Compensation shall mean the amount of Clawback Eligible Incentive Compensation that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been Received had it been determined based on the restated 

amounts, computed without regard to any taxes paid. With respect to any compensation plan or program that takes into account Incentive-Based Compensation, the amount contributed to a notional account that exceeds the amount that otherwise would have been contributed had it been determined based on the restated amount, computed without regard to any taxes paid, shall be considered Erroneously Awarded Compensation, along with earnings accrued on that notional amount. 
 (h) Exchange shall mean the New York Stock Exchange. 
 (i) Financial Reporting Measures shall mean measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s financial statements, and all other measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures. Stock price and total shareholder return (and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from stock price or total shareholder return) shall for purposes of this Policy be considered Financial Reporting Measures. For the avoidance of doubt, a measure need not be presented in the Company s financial statements or included in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC in order to be considered a Financial Reporting Measure. 
 (j) Incentive-Based Compensation shall mean any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure. 
 (k) Listing Standards shall mean Section 303A.14 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual.

Incentive-Based Compensation shall be deemed received for this purpose in the Company s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the applicable Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if payment or grant of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period. 
 (m) Restatement Trigger Date shall mean the earlier to occur of (i) the date the Board, a committee of the Board, or the officer(s) of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, or (ii) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement. 
 4. Recoupment of Erroneously Awarded Compensation . Upon the occurrence of a Restatement Trigger Date, the Company shall recoup Erroneously Awarded Compensation reasonably promptly, in the manner described below. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company s obligation to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation under this Policy is not dependent on if or when restated financial statements are filed following the Restatement Trigger Date. 
 (a) Process. The LDCC shall use the following process for recoupment 
 (i) First, the LDCC will determine the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation for each Covered Executive in connection with such Accounting Restatement. For Incentive-Based Compensation based on (or derived from) stock price or total shareholder return where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the applicable Accounting Restatement, the amount shall be determined by the LDCC based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was Received (in which case, the Company shall maintain documentation of such determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the Exchange). 
 (ii) Second, the LDCC will provide each affected Covered Executive with a written notice stating the amount of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation, a demand for recoupment, and the means of recoupment that the Company will accept. 
 -2- 

(b) Means of Recoupment. The LDCC shall have discretion to determine the appropriate means of recoupment of Erroneously Awarded Compensation, which may include without limitation (i) recoupment of cash or shares of Company stock, (ii) forfeiture of unvested cash or equity awards (including those subject to service-based and or performance-based vesting conditions), (iii) cancellation of outstanding vested cash or equity awards (including those for which service-based and or performance-based vesting conditions have been satisfied), (iv) to the extent consistent with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended Section 409A ), offset of other amounts owed to the Covered Executive or forfeiture of deferred compensation, (v) reduction of future compensation, and (vi) any other remedial or recovery action permitted by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Group makes no guarantee as to the treatment of such amounts under Section 409A, and shall have no liability with respect thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, appropriate means of recoupment pursuant to this Section 4(b) may include actions to recover from amounts approved, awarded, or granted prior to the Effective Date. Except as set forth in Section 4(d) below, in no event may the Company Group accept an amount that is less than the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation in satisfaction of a Covered Executive s obligations hereunder. 
 (c) Failure to Repay. To the extent that a Covered Executive fails to repay all Erroneously Awarded Compensation to the Company Group when due (as determined in accordance with Section 4(a) above), the Company shall, or shall cause one or more other members of the Company Group to, take all actions reasonable and appropriate to recoup such Erroneously Awarded Compensation from the applicable Covered Executive. The applicable Covered Executive shall be required to reimburse the Company Group for any and all expenses reasonably incurred (including legal fees) by the Company Group in recouping such Erroneously Awarded Compensation. 
 (d) Exceptions. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to recoup Erroneously Awarded Compensation if one of the following conditions is met and the LDCC determines that recoupment would be impracticable 
 (i) The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy against a Covered Executive would exceed the amount to be recouped, after the Company has made a reasonable attempt to recoup the applicable Erroneously Awarded Compensation, documented such attempts, and provided such documentation to the Exchange 
 (ii) Recoupment would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022, provided that, before determining that it would be impracticable to recoup any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on violation of home country law, the Company has obtained an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to the Exchange, that recoupment would result in such a violation and a copy of the opinion is provided to the Exchange or 
 (iii) Recoupment would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder. 
 5. Reporting and Disclosure . The Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Rules. 
 6. Indemnification Prohibition . No member of the Company Group shall be permitted to indemnify any current or former Covered Executive against (i) the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation that is recouped pursuant to the terms of this Policy, or (ii) any claims relating to the Company Group s enforcement of its rights under this Policy. The Company may not pay or reimburse any Covered Executive for the cost of third-party insurance purchased by a Covered Executive to fund potential recoupment obligations under this Policy. 
 7. Acknowledgmen t. Each Covered Executive will sign and return to the Company the acknowledgement form attached hereto as Exhibit A pursuant to which such Covered Executive will agree to be bound by the terms of, and comply with, this Policy. For the avoidance of doubt, 
 -3- 

each Covered Executive will be fully bound by, and must comply with, the Policy, whether or not such Covered Executive has executed and returned such acknowledgment form to the Company. 
 8. Interpretation . The LDCC is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy. The LDCC intends that this Policy be interpreted consistent with the Dodd-Frank Rules. 
 9. Amendment Termination . The LDCC or the Board, as applicable, may amend or terminate this Policy at any time in its discretion, including as and when it determines that it is legally required to do so by any federal securities laws, SEC rule or the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the Company s securities are listed. 
 10. Other Recoupment Rights . The LDCC intends that this Policy be applied to the fullest extent of the law. The LDCC may require that any employment offer letter or agreement, equity award, cash incentive award, or any other agreement with a Covered Executive be conditioned on the Covered Executive s agreement to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company Group, whether arising under applicable law, regulation or rule, pursuant to the terms of any other policy of the Company Group, pursuant to any employment offer letter or agreement, equity award, cash incentive award, or other plan or agreement applicable to a Covered Executive, or otherwise (the Separate Clawback Rights ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no duplication of recoupment of the same Erroneously Awarded Compensation under this Policy and the Separate Clawback Rights, unless required by applicable law. To the extent both this Policy and the Supplemental Clawback Policy would require recoupment of the same Erroneously Awarded Compensation (as defined in this Policy), this Policy will govern. The Supplemental Clawback Policy continues to apply to Incentive-Based Compensation (as defined in this Policy) not covered by this Policy. 
 11. Successors . This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives.
