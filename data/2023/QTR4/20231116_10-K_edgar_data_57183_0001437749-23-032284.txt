 OVERVIEW 
 
 Spire Inc. Spire was formed in 2000 and is the holding company for Spire Missouri Inc. Spire Missouri ), Spire Alabama Inc. Spire Alabama ), other gas utilities, and gas-related businesses.

The Company has three reportable business segments: Gas Utility, Gas Marketing and Midstream. 
 
 The Gas Utility segment includes the regulated operations of Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama, Spire Gulf Inc. Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi Inc. Spire Mississippi (collectively, the Utilities ). The business of the Utilities is subject to seasonal fluctuations with the peak period occurring in the winter heating season, typically November through April of each fiscal year. Spire Missouri is a public utility engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas, with primary offices located in St. Louis, Missouri. Spire Missouri is the largest natural gas distribution utility system in Missouri, serving approximately 1.2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in St. Louis, Kansas City, and other areas in Missouri. Spire Alabama is a public utility engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas principally in central and northern Alabama, serving more than 0.4 million residential, commercial and industrial customers with primary offices located in Birmingham, Alabama. Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi are utilities engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas to 0.1 million customers in the Mobile, Alabama area and south-central Mississippi. 
 
 The Gas Marketing segment includes Spire Marketing Inc. Spire Marketing ), a wholly owned subsidiary providing natural gas marketing services. 
 
 The Midstream segment includes Spire STL Pipeline LLC Spire STL Pipeline and Spire Storage (consisting of the operations of Spire Storage West LLC and Spire Storage Salt Plains LLC), which are subsidiaries engaged in the transportation and storage of natural gas. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, Spire had 3,589 employees, including 1,967 for Spire Missouri and 802 for Spire Alabama. We believe that: 

1. 
 the safety and well-being of our employees is one of our most important responsibilities, 

2. 
 the development, education and advancement of employees is key to our sustainability, and 

3. 
 embracing an inclusive workforce full of diverse backgrounds and perspectives drives innovation. 

We continue to implement processes, procedures and programs that reflect our focus on consistently reducing our employee injury and motor vehicle accident rates. In 2023, we held our 10 th annual safety summit, and we encourage employees to identify potential safety improvements in the workplace, which is one of the driving forces behind reducing motor vehicle incidents and work-related injuries. We have also installed safety cameras in all Company vehicles, which are accompanied by driver coaching initiatives, to promote safe driving habits. To support employee wellness, we offer incentives for weight management and gym membership, as well as employee assistance programs to provide counseling services and emotional support, and we have a formalized comprehensive well-being program that focuses on the physical, emotional, social and financial health of every employee. 
 
 All employees have access to developmental assessments, customized training, specialized degree programs, and partnerships with best-in-class organizations related to industry courses, leadership and management workshops and computer application development seminars. In addition, all employees are eligible for up to 6,000 per year in tuition assistance and have access to the Spire Learning Center, our robust internal learning management system. In their first year, each construction and maintenance employee receives 80 hours of safety training, while each service and installation employee receives 200 hours of training. Field operations employees average 24 hours of technical and procedural training annually. 
 
 We regularly review and adjust our affirmative action plans based on placement and utilization rates, and we strive to create an even more diverse and inclusive work environment. Our Human Rights Policy demonstrates that Spire understands its universal responsibility to respect human rights and provides the basis for publicly affirming our values and embedding the responsibility into Spire s operations and the way we do business.

 GAS UTILITY 
 
 Natural Gas Supply 
 
 The Utilities fundamental gas supply strategy is to meet the two-fold objective of 1) ensuring a dependable gas supply is available for delivery when needed and 2) insofar as is compatible with that dependability, purchasing gas that is economically priced. In structuring their natural gas supply portfolio, the Utilities focus on natural gas assets that are strategically positioned to meet the Utilities primary objectives. 
 
 Spire Missouri focuses its gas supply portfolio around a number of large natural gas suppliers with equity ownership or control of assets strategically situated to complement its regionally diverse firm transportation arrangements. Spire Missouri utilizes Midcontinent, Gulf Coast, Northeast, and Rocky Mountain gas sources to provide a level of supply diversity that facilitates the optimization of pricing differentials as well as protecting against the potential of regional supply disruptions. Further, Spire STL Pipeline may deliver up to 400,000 million British thermal units (MMBtu) per day of natural gas into eastern Missouri, of which Spire Missouri is the foundation shipper with a contractual commitment of 350,000 MMBtu per day. 
 
 In fiscal 2023 , Spire Missouri purchased natural gas from 24 different suppliers to meet its total service area current gas sales and storage injection requirements. Spire Missouri entered into firm agreements with suppliers including major producers and marketers providing flexibility to meet the temperature-sensitive needs of its customers. Natural gas purchased by Spire Missouri for delivery to its service areas included 50.3 billion cubic feet (Bcf) through the Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, Inc. (Southern Star) system, 35.8 Bcf through the Enable Mississippi River Transmission LLC (MRT) system, 22.9 Bcf through the Spire STL Pipeline, 6.0 Bcf through the Tallgrass Interstate Gas Transmission, LLC (TIGT) system, 4.3 Bcf through the Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, LP (PEPL) system, and 2.8 Bcf through the Rockies Express Pipeline, LLC (REX) system. Spire Missouri also holds firm transportation arrangements on several other interstate pipeline systems that provide access to gas supplies upstream. Some of Spire Missouri s commercial and industrial customers purchased their own gas with Spire Missouri transporting 51.2 Bcf to them through its distribution system. 
 
 The fiscal 2023 peak day send out of natural gas to Spire Missouri East customers, including transportation customers, occurred on December 23, 2022. The average temperature was 6 degrees Fahrenheit in St. Louis, and on that day Spire Missouri East customers consumed 1.04 Bcf of natural gas. This peak day demand was met with natural gas transported to St. Louis through the MRT, Missouri Gas Pipeline LLC, Spire STL Pipeline, and Southern Star transportation systems, and from Spire Missouri s on-system storage. 
 
 The fiscal 2023 peak day send out of natural gas to Spire Missouri West customers, including transportation customers, occurred on December 22, 2022. The average temperature was -3 degrees Fahrenheit in Kansas City, and on that day Spire Missouri West customers consumed 0.91 Bcf of natural gas. This peak day demand was met with natural gas transported to Kansas City through the Southern Star, PEPL, TIGT, and REX transportation systems. 
 
 Spire Alabama s distribution system is connected to two major interstate natural gas pipeline systems, Southern Natural Gas Company, L.L.C. (Southern Natural Gas) and Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco). It is also connected to two intrastate natural gas pipeline systems.

Table of Contents 

Spire Alabama purchases natural gas from various natural gas producers and marketers. Certain volumes are purchased under firm contractual commitments with other volumes purchased on a spot market basis. The purchased volumes are delivered to Spire Alabama s system using a variety of firm transportation, interruptible transportation and storage capacity arrangements designed to meet the system s varying levels of demand. 
 
 In fiscal 2023, Spire Alabama purchased natural gas from 24 different suppliers to meet current gas sales, storage injection, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) liquefaction requirements, of which one supplier is under a long-term supply agreement. Approximately 47.8 Bcf was purchased for delivery by Southern Natural Gas, 5.6 Bcf by BBT-AlaTenn, 3.8 Bcf by Transco, and 18.2 Bcf through intrastate pipelines to the Spire Alabama delivery points for its residential, commercial, and industrial customers. 
 
 The fiscal 2023 peak day send out for Spire Alabama was 0.6 Bcf of natural gas on December 23, 2022, when the average temperature was 13 degrees Fahrenheit in Birmingham, of which 80 was met with supplies transported through Southern Natural Gas, Transco, and intrastate facilities. The remaining 20 was fulfilled with LNG. 
 
 Spire Gulf s distribution system is directly connected to interstate pipelines, natural gas processing plants and gas storage facilities. Spire Gulf buys from a variety of producers and marketers, with BP Energy Company being the primary supplier. 
 
 Natural Gas Storage 
 
 Spire Missouri believes it currently has ample storage capacity to meet the demands of its distribution system, particularly to augment its supply during peak demand periods. Spire Missouri has a contractual right to store 21.6 Bcf of gas in MRT s storage facility located in Unionville, Louisiana, 16.0 Bcf of gas storage in Southern Star s system storage facilities located in Kansas and Oklahoma, 1.4 Bcf of firm storage on PEPL s system storage, and 1.0 Bcf of firm storage with Spire Storage Salt Plains. MRT s tariffs allow injections into storage from May 1 through November 1 and require the withdrawal from storage of all but 4.3 Bcf from November 1 through May 1. Southern Star tariffs allow both injections and withdrawals into storage year-round with ratchets that restrict the associated flows dependent upon the underlying inventory level per the contracts. 
 
 In addition, Spire Missouri supplements pipeline gas with natural gas withdrawn from its own underground storage field located in St. Louis and St. Charles Counties in Missouri. The field is designed to provide approximately 0.35 Bcf of natural gas withdrawals on a peak day and provides the ability to reinject natural gas during the heating season to replenish or increase deliverability, subject to maximum annual net withdrawals of approximately 4.0 Bcf of natural gas based on the inventory level that Spire Missouri plans to maintain. 
 
 Spire Alabama has a contractual right to store 12.7 Bcf of gas with Southern Natural Gas, 0.5 Bcf of gas with Gulf South Pipeline, 0.2 Bcf of gas with Transco and 0.2 Bcf of gas with Tennessee Gas Pipeline. In addition, Spire Alabama has 2.0 Bcf of on-system LNG storage that can provide the system with up to an additional 0.2 Bcf of natural gas daily to meet peak day demand. 
 
 Spire Gulf obtains adequate storage capacity through Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP, and Enstor Gas, LLC s Bay Gas Storage. 
 
 Union Agreements 
 
 The Company believes labor relations with its employees are good. Should that condition change, the Company could experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions that could negatively impact the Company s system operations, customer service, results of operations and cash flows.

 Regulatory Matters 
 
 For details on regulatory matters, see Note 15 , Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. 
 
 Other Pertinent Matters 
 
 Spire Missouri is the only distributor of natural gas within its franchised service areas, while Spire Alabama is the main distributor of natural gas in its service areas. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have franchises in nearly all the communities where they provide service with terms varying from five years to an indefinite duration. A franchise is essentially a municipal permit to install and maintain pipes and construct other facilities in the community. All of the franchises are free from unduly burdensome restrictions and are adequate for the conduct of Spire Missouri s and Spire Alabama s current public utility businesses in their respective states. In recent years, although certain franchise agreements have expired, the Utilities have continued to provide service in those communities without formal franchises. 
 
 The principal competition for the Utilities comes from the local electric companies. Other competitors in the service areas include suppliers of fuel oil, coal, and propane, as well as natural gas pipelines that can directly connect to large volume customers. Coal has been price competitive as a fuel source for very large boiler plant loads, but environmental requirements have shifted the economic advantage to natural gas. Oil and propane can be used to fuel boiler loads and certain direct-fired process applications, but these fuels require on-site storage, thus limiting their competitiveness. Competition also comes from district steam systems in the downtown areas of both St. Louis and Kansas City and from municipally or publicly owned natural gas distributors located adjacent to the Alabama service territories. Direct use of renewables will continue to grow in the future and compete against distributed generation using natural gas.

Table of Contents 

Residential, commercial, and industrial customers represent approximately 95 and 83 of fiscal 2023 operating revenues for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, respectively. Given the current level of natural gas supply and market conditions, the Utilities believe that the relative comparison of natural gas equipment and operating costs with those of competitive fuels will not change significantly in the foreseeable future, and that these markets will continue to be supplied by natural gas. In new multi-family and commercial rental markets, the Utilities competitive exposures are presently limited to space and water heating applications. 
 
 Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama offer gas transportation service to its large commercial and industrial customers. Transportation customers represent approximately 2 and 14 of fiscal 2023 operating revenues for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, respectively. The Spire Missouri tariff approved for that type of service produces a margin similar to that which Spire Missouri would have received under their regular sales rates. Similarly, Spire Alabama s tariff is based on Spire Alabama s sales profit margin so that operating margins are unaffected. 
 
 The Utilities are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that, to date, have not materially affected the Utilities or the Company s financial position and results of operations. For a detailed discussion of environmental matters, see Note 16 , Commitment and Contingencies, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. 
 
 GAS MARKETING 
 
 Spire Marketing is engaged in the marketing of natural gas and related services throughout the U.S., which includes customers within and outside of the Utilities service areas. For fiscal 2023 and 2022, Spire Marketing volumes averaged 1.40 Bcf/day and 1.73 Bcf/day, respectively. The majority of Spire Marketing s business is derived from the procurement and physical delivery of natural gas to a diverse customer base, primarily in the central and southern U.S. Through its retail operations, Spire Marketing offers natural gas marketing services to large commercial and industrial customers, while its wholesale business consists of producers, pipelines, power generators, municipalities, storage operators, and utility companies. Wholesale activities currently represent a majority of the total Gas Marketing business. The Gas Marketing strategy is to leverage its market expertise and risk management skills to manage and optimize the value of its portfolio of commodity, transportation, park and loan, and storage contracts while controlling costs and acting on new marketplace opportunities. 
 
 In the course of its business, Spire Marketing enters into agreements to purchase natural gas at a future date in order to lock up supply to cover future sales commitments to its customers. To secure access to the markets it serves, Spire Marketing contracts for transportation capacity on various pipelines from pipeline companies directly and from other parties through the secondary capacity market. Throughout fiscal 2023, Spire Marketing held approximately 1 Bcf per day of firm transportation capacity. In addition, to ensure reliability of service and to provide operational flexibility, Spire Marketing enters into firm storage contracts and interruptible park and loan transactions with various companies, where it is able to buy and retain gas to be delivered at a future date, at which time it sells the natural gas to third parties. As of September 30, 2023 , Spire Marketing has contracted for approximately 18 B cf of such storage and park and loan capacity for the 2023-2024 winter season.

MIDSTREAM 
 
 Spire Midstream consists of three facilities located in the U.S.: Spire STL Pipeline, Spire Storage West, and Spire Storage Salt Plains. 
 
 Spire STL Pipeline owns and operates a 65-mile pipeline connecting the Rockies Express Pipeline in Scott County, Illinois, to multiple delivery points in St. Louis County, Missouri, including Spire Missouri. Spire STL Pipeline s operating revenue is derived primarily from Spire Missouri as its foundation shipper. The pipeline is under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). 
 
 Spire Storage West is engaged in the storage of natural gas serving markets primarily in the western region of the U.S. The facility is located in southwestern Wyoming and consists of two storage fields operating under one FERC market-based rate tariff currently authorized to provide up to 55 Bcf of storage capacity to customers. The actual storage capacity was 23 Bcf as of September 30, 2023, and management is in the process of expanding it to 39 Bcf by 2025. 
 
 Spire Storage Salt Plains is located in north central Oklahoma and serves markets in the midcontinent and midwestern U.S. The facility operates under intrastate regulation and has a certificated capacity of 13 Bcf and working capacity of 10 Bcf. 
 
 OTHER 
 
 Other components of the Company s consolidated information include Spire's subsidiaries engaged in the operation of a propane pipeline and risk management, among other activities, and unallocated corporate items, including certain debt and associated interest costs.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Spire s, Spire Missouri s and Spire Alabama s businesses and financial results are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth below. The risks described below are those management considers to be material. When considering any investment in these companies securities, investors should carefully consider the following information, as well as information contained in the caption Forward-Looking Statements, Item 7A, and other documents Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama file with the SEC. This list is not exhaustive, and management places no priority or likelihood based on the risk descriptions, order of presentation or grouping. 
 
 RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT RELATE TO REGULATORY, LEGISLATIVE AND LITIGATION FACTORS 
 
 Regulatory and legislative developments in the energy industry related to climate change or in support of increased energy efficiency may adversely affect operations and financial results. 
 
 There have been a number of federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed in recent years in an attempt to control or limit the effects of global warming and overall climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions, such as methane and carbon dioxide. Adoption of this type of legislation by Congress or similar legislation by states or localities, or the adoption of related regulations by federal, state or local governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, restricting the use of fossil fuels, such as natural gas, or restricting the construction of infrastructure could have far-reaching and significant impacts on the energy industry. Such new legislation or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, adversely affect the demand for natural gas and/or midstream services, or impact the prices charged to customers, potentially reducing customer growth opportunities and/or increasing the cost of doing business. 
 
 In addition, legislative and regulatory initiatives by the federal, state and local governments addressing greenhouse gas emissions or restricting the use of natural gas could adversely affect customer demand. The promulgation of regulations of the emissions of greenhouse gases and efficiency for residential gas furnaces and other gas appliances or the potential enactment of congressional legislation addressing global warming and climate change may decrease customer usage, encourage fuel switching from gas to other energy forms, and may result in future additional compliance costs that could impact the Utilities financial conditions and results of operations. At this time, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations that may be adopted on the Company s and the Utilities future business, financial condition or financial results. 
 
 Regulation of the Utilities businesses may impact rates they are able to charge, costs, and profitability. 
 
 The Utilities are subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities. At the state level, the Utilities are regulated in Missouri by the Missouri Public Service Commission (MoPSC), in Alabama by the Alabama Public Service Commission (APSC), and in Mississippi by the Mississippi Public Service Commission (MSPSC). These state public service commissions regulate many aspects of the Utilities distribution operations, including construction and maintenance of facilities, operations, safety, the rates the Utilities may charge customers, the terms of service to their customers, transactions with their affiliates, the rate of return they are allowed to realize, and the accounting treatment for certain aspects of their operations. For further discussion of these accounting matters, see Regulatory Accounting under Critical Accounting Estimates in Item 7. 
 
 Accounting for the economics of rate regulation affects multiple financial statement line items (such as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; and operating expenses) and affects multiple disclosures in the Company s financial statements. There is a risk that the state public service commissions will not approve full recovery of the costs of providing utility service or recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. A material disallowance of deferred costs could adversely affect the Utilities results of operations. 
 
 The MoPSC also approves Spire Missouri s Infrastructure System Replacement Surcharge (ISRS). The ISRS allows Spire Missouri expedited recovery for its investment to upgrade its infrastructure and enhance its safety and reliability without the necessity of a formal rate case. Such investments are subject to review, and there is risk that any material disallowance of costs under ISRS could adversely affect the timing of revenues and cash flows.

The Utilities ability to obtain and timely implement rate increases and rate supplements to maintain the current rate of return is subject to regulatory review and approval. There can be no assurance that they will be able to obtain rate increases or rate supplements or continue earning the current authorized rates of return. Spire Alabama s and Spire Gulf s rate setting process, Rate Stabilization and Equalization (RSE), is subject to regulation by the APSC and is implemented pursuant to APSC orders expiring September 30, 2025. RSE adjustments would continue after that date unless the APSC enters an order to the contrary in a manner consistent with the law. Spire Mississippi is subject to regulation by the MSPSC and utilizes the Rate Stabilization Adjustment (RSA) Rider. For further details, see Note 15 , Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. 
 
 The Utilities could incur additional costs if required to adjust to new laws or regulations, revisions to existing laws or regulations or changes in interpretations of existing laws or regulations. In addition, as the regulatory environment for the natural gas industry increases in complexity, the risk of inadvertent noncompliance could also increase. If the Utilities fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, whether existing or new, they could be subject to fines, penalties, business interruption or other enforcement action by the authorities that regulate the Utilities operations. 
 
 Federal safety and integrity regulations related to pipeline and storage operators and owners of critical infrastructure may impose significant costs and liabilities on the Company . 
 
 The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) requires pipeline and natural gas storage operators to develop integrity management programs to evaluate their pipelines comprehensively and to take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in areas where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm. 
 
 The Company is required to maintain programs that are intended to assess pipeline integrity. Any repair, remediation, preventative or mitigating actions may require significant capital and operating expenditures. PHMSA constantly updates its regulations to ensure the highest levels of pipeline safety. As the operator of pipelines, Spire is required to: 

perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity; 

identify and characterize applicable threats to pipelines; 

improve data collection, integration and analysis; 

repair and remediate the pipeline as necessary; and 

implement preventative and mitigating actions. 

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requires owners and operators of specified pipeline facilities to take action to prevent disruption and degradation to their infrastructure to achieve the following security outcomes: 

develop network segmentation policies and controls 

create access control measures to secure and prevent unauthorized access to critical cyber systems; 

build continuous monitoring and detection policies and procedures to detect threats and correct anomalies; and 

reduce the risk of exploitation of unpatched systems in a timely manner using a risk-based methodology. 

As such, pipeline owners and operators are required to establish and execute a TSA-approved Cybersecurity Implementation Plan, develop and maintain a Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan, and establish a Cybersecurity Assessment Program. 
 
 Costs to comply with these and other such future safety and integrity regulations are significant. Additionally, should the Company fail to comply with applicable statutes, rules, regulations and orders, it could be subject to significant fines, penalties, business interruption or other enforcement actions. 
 
 Environmental laws and regulations may require significant expenditures or increase operating costs. 
 
 The Utilities and Midstream companies are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of their present and future operations. These laws and regulations require these businesses to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections, and approvals. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations and failure to obtain any required permits and licenses may result in costs in the form of fines, penalties, business interruptions or other enforcement actions, which may be material. In addition, existing environmental laws and regulations could be revised or reinterpreted and/or new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to these companies or their facilities, thereby impacting the cost of compliance. The discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions, including former manufactured gas plant sites, and adverse claims under environmental laws and regulations may result in expenditures and liabilities, which could be material. To the extent environmental compliance costs are self-insured, or not fully covered by insurance or recovered in rates from customers, those costs may have an adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations.

Table of Contents 

The Utilities liquidity may be adversely affected by delays in recovery of their costs, due to regulation. 
 
 In the normal course of business, there is a lag between when the Utilities incur increases in certain of their costs and the time in which those costs are considered for recovery in the ratemaking process. Cash requirements for increased gas supply costs, operating costs, increased funding levels of defined benefit pension and postretirement costs, capital expenditures, interest expense and other increases in the costs of doing business, including inflation, can require outlays of cash prior to the authorization of increases in rates charged to customers, as approved by the MoPSC, APSC, or MSPSC. Accordingly, the Utilities liquidity can be adversely impacted to the extent higher costs are not timely recovered from their customers. 
 
 Changes to income tax policy, certain tax elections, tax regulations and future taxable income could adversely impact the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The Company has significantly reduced its current federal and state income tax obligations over the past few years through tax planning strategies and application of tax rules which included the use of bonus depreciation deductions for certain expenditures for property. As a result, the Company generated large annual taxable losses that have resulted in significant federal and state net operating losses. The Company plans to utilize these net operating losses in the future. The value of these net operating losses could be reduced if the Company cannot generate enough taxable income in the future to utilize all of the net operating losses generated prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 before they expire due to income tax policy changes, lower-than-expected financial performance and/or regulatory actions. 
 
 Changes to income tax policy, laws and regulations, including but not limited to changes in tax rates, the deductibility of certain expenses including interest and/or changes in the deductibility of certain expenditures for property, could adversely impact the Company. Those impacts could include reducing the value of its net operating losses and could result in material charges to earnings. Further, the Company s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Notably, the Inflation Reduction Act became effective on August 16, 2022. This new law provides various tax credits and incentives with respect to clean energy. The Company is still evaluating the impact and applicability of these programs to its operations, but they are not expected to have a material impact on the Company. 
 
 The Company may be involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies that could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 The Company may be involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies with respect to general claims, rates, environmental issues, gas cost prudence reviews and other matters. For further details, see Contingencies in Note 16 to the financial statements in Item 8. Adverse decisions regarding these matters, to the extent they require the Company to make payments in excess of amounts provided for in its financial statements, or to the extent they are self-insured or not covered by insurance, could adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Commodity markets and derivative instruments are regulated by federal agencies, and new developments in this area may adversely impact Spire Marketing s results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 As a participant in the natural gas market, Spire Marketing is subject to applicable statutes, rules, regulations and orders administered by FERC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), including those directed generally to prevent fraud or manipulation involving natural gas transactions (physical or financial transactions). Spire Marketing could be subject to fines, penalties, business interruption or other enforcement actions by the FERC or CFTC, or both, for failure to comply with such rules. New regulatory and legislative actions may adversely impact Spire Marketing s results of operations and financial condition by potentially reducing customer growth opportunities and/or increasing the costs of doing business. 
 
 Spire Marketing uses bilateral contracts and derivative instruments such as futures contracts, options and swaps to hedge or mitigate ongoing commercial risks. Most standardized swaps, under the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations from the CFTC, are required to be cleared through a registered clearing facility and traded on a designated exchange or swap execution facility, subject to certain exceptions. These regulations may also require compliance with certain margin requirements for over-the-counter derivative contracts with certain regulated entities, which could adversely affect liquidity and ability to use derivatives to hedge risks. In addition, the CFTC s rules require companies, including Spire Marketing, to maintain regulatory records of swap transactions, and to report swaps to centralized swap data repositories, among other compliance obligations. 

13

Table of Contents 

Although Spire Marketing may qualify for exceptions to certain of these CFTC rules, its derivatives counterparties are likely subject to capital, margin, documentation and business conduct requirements imposed as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act. These obligations may increase transaction costs and may make it more difficult for Spire Marketing to enter into hedging transactions on favorable terms or affect the number and/or creditworthiness of available swap counterparties. In that event, Spire Marketing s inability to enter into derivatives instruments or other commercial risk hedging transactions on favorable terms, or at all, could increase operating expenses and expose it to unhedged commercial risks, including potential adverse changes in commodity prices. 
 
 In October 2020, the CFTC finalized its rules that modify and expand the applicability of speculative position limits on the amounts of certain futures contracts (including options thereon), cash-settled lookalike contracts for or linked to the commodities underlying the foregoing futures contracts, as well as economically equivalent swaps containing identical material contractual specifications, terms and conditions as the foregoing contracts. While Spire Marketing anticipates qualifying for a bona fide hedging exemption from such limits, the CFTC s final rules and earlier adopted aggregation rules may cause Spire Marketing s hedging strategies described above to be limited if Spire Marketing is unable to qualify for an exemption. 
 
 RISKS THAT RELATE TO OPERATIONAL FACTORS 
 
 The Company s ability to meet its customers natural gas requirements may be impaired if contracted gas supplies, interstate pipeline and/or storage services are not available or delivered in a timely manner. 
 
 In order to meet their customers annual and seasonal natural gas demands, the Utilities must obtain sufficient supplies, interstate pipeline capacity, and storage capacity. If they are unable to obtain these, either from their suppliers inability to deliver the contracted commodity or the inability to secure replacement quantities, to the extent not mitigated by tariffs, contractual indemnification or insurance, the Utilities financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. If a substantial disruption in interstate natural gas pipelines transmission and storage capacity were to occur during periods of heavy demand, the Utilities financial results could be adversely impacted. 
 
 Spire Marketing s ability to deliver natural gas to its customers is contingent upon the performance of its suppliers and capability of pipeline and storage operators to fulfill delivery obligations to Spire Marketing under firm contracts. To the extent that it is unable to obtain the necessary supplies, Spire Marketing s financial position and results of operations may be adversely impacted. 
 
 Midstream is dependent upon third-party pipelines and other facilities to provide delivery options to and from its facilities. If any pipeline connection were to become unavailable for volumes of natural gas due to repairs, damage to the facility, lack of capacity or any other reason, the ability to continue receiving or delivering natural gas could be restricted, and to the extent not mitigated by contractual indemnification, insurance or tariffs, would thereby reduce its revenues. Any permanent interruption that causes a material reduction in volumes could result in an impairment loss that could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Transporting, distributing, and storing natural gas and propane involves numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks. 
 
 Natural gas transportation, distribution and storage activities inherently involve a variety of integrity issues, hazards and operations risks, such as leaks, accidental explosions, blowouts, damage caused by third parties, and mechanical problems, which could cause substantial financial losses. In addition, these risks could result in serious injury to employees and non-employees, loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of operations, and substantial losses to the Company and its subsidiaries. The location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. Similar risks also exist for Spire Missouri s propane storage, transmission and minor distribution operations. These activities may subject the Company to litigation or administrative proceedings. Such litigation or proceedings could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines, penalties, business interruption or other enforcement actions against the Company and its subsidiaries or be resolved on unfavorable terms. In accordance with customary industry practices, the Utilities and other Spire businesses maintain insurance against a significant portion, but not all, of these risks and losses. To the extent the occurrence of any of these events is self-insured or not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries.

Table of Contents 

Because of competition, the Company may not be able to retain existing customers or acquire new customers, or may be unsuccessful in retaining or acquiring contractual assets on favorable terms, which could have an adverse impact on its business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 The Utilities face the risk that larger commercial or industrial customers may bypass gas distribution services by directly connecting with interstate pipelines or, in the case of Spire Alabama and Spire Gulf, also from municipally or publicly owned gas distributors located adjacent to its service territory. The Utilities cannot provide any assurance that increased competition will not have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 The Utilities compete with distributors offering a broad range of services and prices, from full-service distributors to those offering delivery only. The Utilities also compete for retail customers with suppliers of alternative energy products, principally propane and electricity, and to a growing extent, distributed sources of renewable energy. If they are unable to compete effectively, the Utilities may lose existing customers and/or fail to acquire new customers, which in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on their business, results of operations and financial condition. Along those lines, changes in wholesale natural gas prices compared with prices for electricity, fuel oil, coal, propane, or other energy sources can significantly impact the cost of delivered natural gas, which may affect the Utilities retention of natural gas customers and may adversely impact their financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Spire Storage is subject to competition from similar services provided by pipelines and from competing independent storage providers capable of serving its customers. Natural gas storage is a competitive business, with competitors having the ability to expand storage capacity. Increased competition in the natural gas storage business could reduce the demand and drive rates down for the Company s natural gas storage services. 
 
 Also, Spire Marketing profitability may be impacted by the effects of the expiration, in the normal course of business, of certain of its natural gas supply, sales, transportation and storage contracts if, because of competition or other reasons, those contracts cannot be replaced and/or renewed with arrangements with similar terms and pricing. 
 
 Significantly warmer-than-normal weather conditions and the effects of climate change may affect the Utilities sale of heating energy and adversely impact their financial position and results of operations. 
 
 The Utilities earnings are primarily generated by the sale of heating energy. Spire Missouri and Spire Mississippi each have a Weather Normalization Adjustment rider, Spire Alabama has a Temperature Adjustment Rider, and Spire Gulf has a Weather Impact Normalization Factor. These mechanisms, approved by the respective state regulatory body, provide better assurance of the recovery of fixed costs and margins during winter months despite variations in sales volumes due to the impacts of weather, while the annual rate designs of Alabama and Mississippi help adjust for other factors that affect customer usage. However, significantly warmer-than-normal weather conditions in the Utilities service areas and other factors, such as climate change, alternative energy sources and increased efficiency of gas furnaces and other appliances, may result in reduced profitability and decreased cash flows attributable to lower gas sales. Furthermore, these mechanisms do not fully mitigate the impact of warmer weather and continuation of these adjustment factors is subject to regulatory discretion. 
 
 To the extent climate change results in warmer temperatures, financial results could be adversely affected through lower gas volumes and revenues and reduced marketing opportunities. Management believes it is likely that any such resulting impacts would occur over a long period of time and thus would be difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity. Another possible impact of climate change may be more frequent and more severe weather events, such as significant wind or flooding events, which could increase costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to customers or result in lost revenues if the Company were unable to deliver natural gas to customers. Such weather events could also disrupt our usual gas supplies and make it impossible or extremely costly to find replacement gas for our customers. To the extent such impacts are self-insured, or not covered by insurance or recovered in rates, the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The Company s natural gas storage business includes inherent geologic and operational risks. 
 
 The Company plans to continue to increase capacity, improve operating performance, and improve the integrity of its storage fields and associated above-ground facilities of Spire Storage. Construction of such assets is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including supply chain and labor disruptions, weather conditions during construction, equipment failures and construction quality issues. Any such disruptions, as well as any negative effects from the risks discussed below, could result in an impairment of Spire's investment in the project, and such impairment could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

Any damage to the Spire Storage facilities or pipelines, or lack of integrity to its storage fields, including damages caused by a blow-out, to the extent such impacts are self-insured or not covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The Company does not own all the land on which its storage facilities were constructed, and it is, therefore, subject to the possibility of more onerous terms or increased costs to retain necessary land use, if and when applicable property rights expire or are renewed. Changes in the terms of such land use could have an adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations of the Company s storage business. 
 
 Increased dependence on technology may hinder the Company s business operations and adversely affect their financial condition and results of operations if such technologies fail. 
 
 The Company has implemented or acquired a variety of technological tools including both Company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties. These tools and systems support critical functions including the Company s integrated planning, scheduling and dispatching of field resources, its automated meter reading system, customer care and billing, procurement and accounts payable, operational plant logistics, management reporting, and external financial reporting. The failure of these or other similarly important technologies, or the Company s inability to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, or integrated into other technologies, could hinder its business operations and, to the extent such impacts are self-insured or not covered by insurance, could adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Although the Company has, when possible, developed alternative sources of technology and built redundancy into its computer networks and tools, there can be no assurance these efforts to date would protect against all potential issues related to the loss of any such technologies or the Company s use of such technologies. 
 
 A cyberattack may disrupt the Company s operations or lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information or potential liability. 
 
 The Company is subject to cybersecurity risks primarily related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive customer, employee, and vendor information maintained by the Company, its subsidiaries, or its third-party vendors in the normal course of business, as well as breaches in the technology that manages natural gas supply and control operations and other business processes. A loss of confidential or proprietary data or security breaches of technology for operations or business processes could adversely affect the Company s reputation, diminish customer confidence, disrupt operations, and subject the Company to possible financial liability, any of which could have a material effect on its financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The Company acknowledges increased dependence on technology increases its exposure to cyberattack. The Company closely monitors both preventive and detective measures to manage these risks and maintain cyber risk insurance to mitigate a significant portion, but not all, of these risks and losses. To the extent that the occurrence of any of these cyber events is self-insured or not covered by insurance, it could adversely affect the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The Company s business activities are concentrated in a few states and regions . 
 
 The Utilities provide natural gas distribution services to customers in Alabama, Mississippi, and Missouri. Midstream is focused on the Rocky Mountain/Western and Midcontinent regions. Changes in the regional economies, politics, regulations and weather patterns of these states could negatively impact growth opportunities and the usage patterns and financial condition of customers and could adversely affect earnings, cash flows, and financial position. 
 
 RISKS THAT RELATE TO FINANCIAL, ECONOMIC AND MARKET FACTORS 
 
 As a holding company, Spire depends on its operating subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations. 
 
 Spire is a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of its operating subsidiaries and cash investments. Spire, and Spire Missouri prior to the holding company s formation in 2000, has paid common stock dividends continuously since 1946. Spire s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate sufficient net income and cash flows to pay upstream dividends and make loans or loan repayments.

Table of Contents 

A downgrade in Spire s and/or its subsidiaries credit ratings and/or reduced access to credit and capital markets may negatively affect its cost of capital or prevent it from executing operating strategies. 
 
 Currently, Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama have investment-grade credit ratings. There is no assurance such credit ratings for any of these companies will remain in effect for any given period of time or such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agency s judgment, circumstances so warrant. Spire has a working capital line of credit to meet its short-term liquidity needs. Spire s line of credit may be used to meet the liquidity needs of any of its subsidiaries, subject to sublimits. If the rating agencies lowered the credit rating at any of these entities, particularly below investment grade, it might significantly limit that entity s ability to secure new or additional credit facilities and would increase its costs of borrowing. Spire s and the Utilities ability to borrow under current or new credit facilities and costs of that borrowing have a direct impact on their ability to execute their operating strategies. 
 
 Spire Marketing relies on its cash flows, ability to effect net settlements with counterparties, parental guaranties, and access to Spire s liquidity resources to satisfy its credit and working capital requirements. Spire Marketing s ability to rely on parental guaranties is dependent upon Spire s financial condition and credit ratings. If Spire s credit ratings were lowered, particularly below investment grade, counterparty acceptance of parental guaranties may diminish, resulting in decreased availability of credit. Additionally, under such circumstances, certain counterparties may require Spire Marketing to provide prepayments or cash deposits, amounts of which would be dependent upon natural gas market conditions. Reduced access to credit or increased credit requirements, which may also be caused by factors such as higher overall natural gas prices, may limit Spire Marketing s ability to enter into certain transactions. In addition, Spire Marketing has concentrations of counterparty credit risk in that a significant portion of its transactions are with (or are associated with) utility companies and their marketing affiliates. The concentration of counterparties ha s the potential to affect the Company s overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that customers in this group may be affected similarly by changes in economic, industry, or other conditions. Spire Marketing also has concentrations of credit risk in certain individually significant counterparties. Spire Marketing closely monitors its credit exposure and, although uncollectible amounts have not been significant, increased counterparty defaults are possible and may result in financial losses and/or capital limitations. 
 Regional supply/demand imbalances, fluctuations in natural gas commodity prices, changes in the terms and rates charged by midstream facilities, and infrastructure projects may adversely impact the future profitability of the Company. 
 
 Competition in the marketplace and fluctuations in natural gas commodity prices have a direct impact on Spire Marketing. Changing market conditions and prices, the narrowing of regional and seasonal price differentials and limited future price volatility may adversely impact its sales margins or affect its ability to procure gas supplies and/or to serve certain customers, which may reduce sales profitability and/or increase certain credit requirements caused by reductions in netting capability. Although the FERC regulates the interstate transportation of natural gas and establishes the general terms and conditions under which Spire Marketing may use interstate gas pipeline capacity to purchase and transport natural gas, Spire Marketing must occasionally renegotiate its transportation agreements with a concentrated group of pipeline companies. Renegotiated terms of new agreements, or increases in FERC-authorized rates of existing agreements, may impact Spire Marketing s future profitability. Profitability may also be adversely impacted if pipeline capacity or future storage capacity secured is not fully utilized. 
 
 Storage businesses are affected by various gas market fundamentals which impact the level of demand for storage services and the rates that can be charged for these services. These market fundamentals include: seasonal price spread; monthly, daily and hourly price volatility; locational basis for pricing points on pipelines connected to a storage facility; seasonal, daily and hourly weather; and operational impacts in supply and market areas served by a storage facility and its connected pipelines. These fundamentals have varying and potentially material adverse impacts on the various services offered by storage facilities and the rates that can be charged for these services in the market. These services include long-term firm storage, short-term park and loan, wheeling, and optimization. Rates below the variable costs to operate a storage facility could result in a decision to not operate all the capacity in the facility or to operate the facility at a loss if required to fulfill firm customer contract obligations. A sustained decline in these rates or a shut-in of all or a portion of one or more facilities capacity could have an adverse impact on the Company s financial condition and results of operations.

Spire Missouri s and Spire Alabama s income from off-system sales and capacity release is subject to fluctuations in market conditions and changing supply and demand conditions in areas the Utilities hold pipeline capacity rights. Specific factors impacting the Utilities income from off-system sales and capacity release include the availability of attractively priced natural gas supply, availability of pipeline capacity, and market demand. Income from off-system sales and capacity release is shared with customers. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama are allowed to retain 25 of the net margins achieved as a result of such off-system sales and capacity release. The Utilities ability to retain such income in the future is also subject to regulatory discretion. 
 
 Rapid significant increases in natural gas prices may adversely affect the Utilities liquidity and, in certain circumstances, results of operations. 
 
 The tariff rate schedules of Spire Missouri, Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi contain Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clauses and Spire Alabama s tariff rate schedule contains a Gas Supply Adjustment (GSA) rider that permit the Utilities to file for rate adjustments to recover the cost of purchased gas. Changes in the cost of purchased gas are flowed through to customers and may affect uncollectible amounts and cash flows and can therefore impact the amount of capital resources. 
 
 Currently, Spire Missouri is allowed to adjust the gas cost component of rates up to four times each year while Spire Alabama and Spire Gulf (collectively, the Alabama Utilities and Spire Mississippi may adjust the gas cost component of their rates on a monthly basis. Spire Missouri must make a mandatory gas cost adjustment at the beginning of the winter, in November, and during the next twelve months may make up to three additional discretionary gas cost adjustments, so long as each of these adjustments is separated by at least two months. 
 
 The MoPSC typically approves the Spire Missouri PGA changes on an interim basis, subject to refund and the outcome of a subsequent audit and prudence review. Due to such review process, there is a risk of a disallowance of full recovery of these costs. Any material disallowance of purchased gas costs would adversely affect results of operations. The Alabama Utilities gas supply charges are submitted for APSC review on a monthly basis, regardless of whether there is a request for a change, so prudence review occurs on an ongoing basis. Spire Mississippi s PGA is adjusted on a monthly basis for the most recent charges and is filed at the MSPSC on a monthly basis. 
 
 Increases in the prices the Utilities charge for gas may also adversely affect revenues because they could lead customers to reduce usage and cause some customers to have trouble paying the resulting higher bills. These higher prices may increase bad debt expenses and ultimately reduce earnings. Rapid increases in the price of purchased gas may result in an increase in short-term debt. 
 
 To lower financial exposure to commodity price fluctuations, Spire Missouri enters into contracts to hedge the forward commodity price of its natural gas supplies. As part of this strategy, Spire Missouri may use fixed-price forward physical purchase contracts, swaps, futures, and option contracts. However, Spire Missouri does not hedge the entire exposure of energy assets or positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. Any costs, gains, or losses experienced through hedging procedures, including carrying costs, generally flow through the PGA clause, thereby limiting Spire Missouri s exposure to earnings volatility. However, variations in the timing of collections of such gas costs under the PGA clause and the effect of cash payments for margin deposits associated with Spire Missouri s use of natural gas derivative instruments may cause short-term cash requirements to vary. These procedures remain subject to prudence review by the MoPSC. 
 
 Other than fixed-price forward physical purchase contracts, Spire Alabama, Spire Gulf, and Spire Mississippi currently do not utilize risk mitigation strategies that incorporate commodity hedge instruments, but Spire Alabama has the ability to do so through its GSA.

Table of Contents 

Risk management policies, including the use of derivative instruments, may not fully protect Spire Marketing s sales and results of operations from volatility and may result in financial losses. 
 
 In the course of its business, Spire Marketing enters into contracts to purchase and sell natural gas at fixed prices and index-based prices. Commodity price risk associated with these contracts has the potential to impact earnings and cash flows. To minimize this risk, Spire Marketing has a risk management policy that provides for daily monitoring of a number of business measures, including fixed price commitments. 
 
 Spire Marketing currently manages the commodity price risk associated with fixed-price commitments for the purchase or sale of natural gas by either closely matching the offsetting physical purchase or sale of natural gas at fixed prices or through the use of natural gas futures, options, and swap contracts traded on or cleared through the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. and/or the Intercontinental Exchange to lock in margins. These exchange-traded/cleared contracts may be designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions. However, market conditions and regional price changes may cause ineffective portions of matched positions to result in financial losses. Additionally, to the extent that Spire Marketing s natural gas contracts are classified as trading activities or do not otherwise qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales designation (or the designation is not elected), the contracts are recorded as derivatives at fair value each period. Accordingly, the associated gains and losses are reported directly in earnings and may cause volatility in results of operations. Gains or losses (realized and unrealized) on certain wholesale purchase and sale contracts, consisting of those classified as trading activities, are required to be presented on a net basis (instead of a gross basis) in the statements of consolidated income. Such presentation could result in volatility in the Company s operating revenues. 
 
 Spire s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are subject to investment and interest rate risk that could negatively impact its financial condition. 
 
 Spire and its subsidiaries have pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide benefits to many of their employees and retirees. Costs of providing benefits and related funding requirements of these plans are subject to changes in the market value of the assets that fund the plans. The funded status of the plans and the related costs reflected in the Company s financial statements are affected by various factors, which are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, including economic conditions, financial market performance, interest rates, life expectancies and demographics. Recessions and volatility in the domestic and international financial markets have negatively affected the asset values of the Company s pension plans at various times in the past. Poor investment returns or lower interest rates may necessitate accelerated funding of the plans to meet minimum federal government requirements, which could have an adverse impact on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. For more information, including regulatory provisions affecting the Utilities plans, see Note 13 , Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. 
 
 In connection with acquisitions, Spire and Spire Missouri recorded goodwill and long-lived assets that could become impaired and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Spire and Spire Missouri assess goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company and Spire Missouri assess their long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable. To the extent the value of goodwill or long-lived assets becomes impaired, the Company and Spire Missouri may be required to incur impairment charges that could have a material impact on their results of operations. 
 
 Since interest rates are a key component, among other assumptions, in the models used to estimate the fair values of the Company s reporting units, rises in interest rates would generally decrease the calculated fair values and future impairments may occur. Due to the subjectivity of the assumptions and estimates underlying the impairment analysis, Spire and Spire Missouri cannot provide assurance that future analyses will not result in impairment. These assumptions and estimates include projected cash flows, current and future rates for contracted capacity, growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and market multiples.

GENERAL RISK FACTORS 
 
 Resources expended to pursue or integrate business acquisitions, investments or other business arrangements may adversely affect Spire s financial position and results of operations and return on investments made may not meet the Company s expectations. 
 
 From time to time, Spire may seek to grow through strategic acquisitions, investments or other business arrangements. Attractive acquisition and investment opportunities may be difficult to complete on economically acceptable terms. It is possible for Spire to expend considerable resources pursuing acquisitions and investments that for a variety of reasons do not move forward. Similarly, investment opportunities may be hindered or halted by regulatory or legal actions. To the extent acquisitions or investments are made, such transactions involve a number of risks, including but not limited to, the assumption of material liabilities, the diversion of management s attention from daily operations, difficulties in assimilation and retention of employees, securing adequate capital to support the transaction, and obtaining regulatory approval. Uncertainties exist in assessing the value, risks, profitability, and liabilities associated with certain businesses or assets and there is a possibility that anticipated operating and financial efficiencies expected to result from an acquisition or investment do not develop. Additionally, there are no assurances resources expended will achieve their intended result. 
 
 The failure to complete an acquisition successfully or to integrate acquisitions or investments it may undertake could have an adverse effect on the Spire s financial condition and results of operations and the market s perception of the Company s execution of its strategy. To the extent Spire engages in any of the above activities together with or through one or more of its subsidiaries, including the Utilities, such subsidiaries may face the same risks. 
 
 Unexpected losses may adversely affect Spire s or its subsidiaries financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 As with most businesses, there are operations and business risks inherent in the activities of Spire s subsidiaries. If, in the normal course of business, Spire or any of its subsidiaries becomes a party to litigation, such litigation could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines, penalties, business interruption or other enforcement actions or be resolved on unfavorable terms. In accordance with customary practice, Spire and its subsidiaries maintain insurance against a significant portion of, but not all, risks and losses , though it does reinsure a portion of the risk from certain of Spire s insurers through its captive insurance company. Spire and its operating companies employ many strategies to gain assurance such risks are appropriately managed, mitigated, or insured, as appropriate. To the extent a loss is self-insured or not fully covered by insurance or other risk mitigation strategies, that loss could adversely affect Spire s and/or its subsidiaries financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Catastrophic events may adversely affect the Company s facilities and operations. 
 
 Catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, tropical storms, winter storms, terrorist acts, acts of civil unrest, pandemic illnesses or other similar occurrences could adversely affect the Utilities facilities and operations, as well as those of Midstream. Emergency planning and training programs are in place to respond to events that could cause business interruptions ; however, unanticipated events or a combination of events, failure in resources needed to respond to events, or slow or inadequate response to events may have an adverse impact. To the extent the impacts of such catastrophic events are not covered by insurance or recovered in rates, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Workforce risks may affect the Company s financial results. 
 
 The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various workforce risks, including, but not limited to, the risk that it will be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel; that it will be unable to effectively transfer to new personnel the knowledge and expertise of an aging workforce as those workers retire; and that it will be unable to reach collective bargaining arrangements with the unions that represent certain of its workers, which could result in work stoppages.

Table of Contents 

The Company may be adversely affected by economic conditions. 
 
 Periods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased energy consumption, particularly by industrial and large commercial companies, a loss of existing customers, and fewer new customers. As a consequence, national or regional recessions or other downturns in economic activity could adversely affect revenues and cash flows or restrict future growth. Economic conditions in the Utilities service territories may also adversely impact the Utilities ability to collect accounts receivable, resulting in an increase in bad debt expense. 
 
 Changes in accounting standards may adversely impact the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Spire and its subsidiaries are subject to changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), SEC regulations and other interpretations of financial reporting requirements for public utilities. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries have any control over the impact these changes may have on their financial condition or results of operations nor the timing of such changes. The potential issues associated with rate-regulated accounting, along with other potential changes to GAAP that the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) continues to consider may be significant.

Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 (Dollars in millions, except per share and per unit amounts) 
 
 INTRODUCTION 
 
 This section analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of Spire Inc. (the Company ), Spire Missouri Inc., and Spire Alabama Inc. Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and Spire EnergySouth are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and the subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth are collectively referred to as the Utilities. The subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth are Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi. This section includes management s view of factors that affect the respective businesses of the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, explanations of financial results including changes in earnings and costs from the prior periods, and the effects of such factors on the Company s, Spire Missouri s and Spire Alabama s overall financial condition and liquidity. Unless otherwise indicated, references to years herein are references to the fiscal years ending September 30 for the Company and its subsidiaries. 
 
 Reference is made to Item 1A. Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements, which describe important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and non-historical information contained herein. In addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes thereto of Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 
 The Company has three reportable segments: Gas Utility, Gas Marketing, and Midstream. Most of Spire s earnings are derived from its Gas Utility segment, which reflects the regulated activities of the Utilities. Due to the seasonal nature of the Utilities business and the volumetric Spire Missouri rate design, earnings of Spire and each of the Utilities are typically concentrated during the heating season of November through April each fiscal year. 
 
 Gas Utility - Spire Missouri 
 
 Spire Missouri is Missouri s largest natural gas distribution utility and is regulated by the MoPSC. Spire Missouri serves St. Louis, Kansas City, and other areas throughout the state. Spire Missouri purchases natural gas in the wholesale market from producers and marketers and ships the gas through interstate pipelines into its own distribution facilities for sale to residential, commercial and industrial customers. Spire Missouri also transports gas through its distribution system for certain larger customers who buy their own gas on the wholesale market. Spire Missouri delivers natural gas to customers at rates and in accordance with tariffs authorized by the MoPSC. The earnings of Spire Missouri are primarily generated by the sale of heating energy. 
 
 Gas Utility - Spire Alabama 
 
 Spire Alabama is the largest natural gas distribution utility in the state of Alabama and is regulated by the APSC. Spire Alabama s service territory is located in central and northern Alabama. Among the cities served by Spire Alabama are Birmingham, the center of the largest metropolitan area in the state, and Montgomery, the state capital. Spire Alabama purchases natural gas through interstate and intrastate suppliers and distributes the purchased gas through its distribution facilities for sale to residential, commercial, and industrial customers and other end-users of natural gas. Spire Alabama also transports gas through its distribution system for certain large commercial and industrial customers for a transportation fee. Effective December 1, 2020, for most of these transportation service customers, Spire Alabama also purchases gas on the wholesale market for sale to the customer upon delivery to the Spire Alabama distribution system. All Spire Alabama services are provided to customers at rates and in accordance with tariffs authorized by the APSC. 
 
 Gas Utility - Spire EnergySouth 
 
 Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi are utilities engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas to approximately 100,000 customers in southern Alabama and south-central Mississippi. Spire Gulf is regulated by the APSC, and Spire Mississippi is regulated by the MSPSC.

Gas Marketing 
 
 Spire Marketing is engaged in the marketing of natural gas and related activities on a non-regulated basis and is reported in the Gas Marketing segment. Spire Marketing markets natural gas to customers across the U.S. (and into Canada), including customers inside and outside of the Utilities service areas. It holds firm transportation and storage contracts in order to effectively manage its transactions with counterparties, which primarily include producers, municipalities, electric and gas utility companies, and large commercial and industrial customers. 
 
 Midstream 
 
 Spire s midstream operations consist of Spire STL Pipeline and Spire Storage (composed of Spire Storage West LLC and Spire Salt Plains Storage LLC). Spire STL Pipeline owns and operates a FERC-regulated 65-mile pipeline connecting the Rockies Express Pipeline in Scott County, Illinois, to delivery points in St. Louis County, Missouri, including Spire Missouri s storage facility. Spire STL Pipeline s operating revenue is derived primarily from Spire Missouri as its foundation shipper. Spire Storage is engaged in the storage of natural gas in the western region of the U.S. Spire Storage consists of two storage fields in Wyoming operating under one FERC market-based rate tariff, and a storage field in Oklahoma that operates under intrastate jurisdiction with authorizations from FERC under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act to provide certain interstate storage, transportation, and hub services. 
 
 Other 
 
 Other components of the Company s consolidated information include Spire's subsidiaries engaged in the operation of a propane pipeline and risk management, among other activities, and unallocated corporate items, including certain debt and associated interest costs. 
 
 Business Evaluation Factors 
 
 Based on the nature of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as current economic conditions, management focuses on several key variables in evaluating the financial condition and results of operations and managing the business. 
 
 For the Gas Utility segment, these include: 

the Utilities ability to recover from their customers the costs of purchasing and distributing natural gas; 

the impact of weather and other factors, such as customer conservation, on revenues and expenses; 

changes in the regulatory environment at the federal, state, and local levels, as well as decisions by regulators, that impact the Utilities ability to earn the authorized rate of return and recover prudent costs in each of the service territories they serve; 

the Utilities ability to access credit markets and maintain working capital sufficient to meet operating requirements; 

the effect of natural gas price volatility on the business; and 

the ability to manage costs, integrate and standardize operations, and upgrade infrastructure. 

In the Gas Marketing segment, these include: 

the risks of competition; 

fluctuations and volatility in natural gas prices; 

the changing flow and availability of natural gas; 

new national infrastructure projects; 

the ability to procure firm transportation and storage services at reasonable rates; 

credit and/or capital market access; and 

counterparty risks.

In the Midstream segment, these include: 

the impact of seasonal weather patterns; 

fluctuations and volatility in natural gas prices; 

the changing flow and availability of natural gas; 

the efficiency of the injection and withdrawal processes for natural gas storage; 

competitive factors in the energy industry; 

energy and other regulation in Spire's storage and transportation service areas; and 

counterparty risks. 

Further information regarding how management seeks to manage these key variables is discussed below. 
 
 Gas Utility 
 
 The Utilities seek to provide reliable natural gas services at a reasonable cost, while maintaining and building secure and dependable infrastructures. The Utilities strategies focus on improving both performance and the ability to recover their authorized distribution costs and rates of return. The Utilities distribution costs are the essential, primarily fixed, expenditures they must incur to operate and maintain more than 60,000 miles of mains and services comprising their natural gas distribution systems and related storage facilities. 
 
 The Utilities distribution costs include wages and employee benefit costs, depreciation and maintenance expenses, and other regulated utility operating expenses, excluding natural and propane gas expense. Distribution costs are considered in the rate-making process, and recovery of these types of costs is included in revenues generated through the Utilities tariff rates. Spire Missouri s tariff rates are approved by the MoPSC, whereas Spire Alabama s tariff rates are approved by the APSC. Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi have tariff rates that are approved by the APSC and MSPSC, respectively. 
 
 Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama also have off-system sales and capacity release income streams that are regulated by tariff but remain subject to fluctuations in market conditions. Some of the factors impacting the level of off-system sales include the availability and cost of Spire s natural gas supply, the weather in its service areas and the weather in other markets. When Spire s service areas experience warmer-than-normal weather while other markets experience colder weather or supply constraints, some of Spire s natural gas supply is available for sale to third parties not on Spire s system. 
 
 The Utilities work actively to reduce the impact of wholesale natural gas price volatility on their costs by strategically structuring their natural gas supply portfolios to increase their gas supply availability and pricing alternatives. They may also use derivative instruments to hedge against significant changes in the commodity price of natural gas. Nevertheless, the overall cost of purchased gas remains subject to fluctuations in market conditions. The Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clause of Spire Missouri, Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi and the Gas Supply Adjustment (GSA) rider of Spire Alabama allow the Utilities to flow through to customers, subject to prudence review by the public service commissions, the cost of purchased gas supplies, including costs, cost reductions and related carrying costs associated with the use of derivative instruments to mitigate volatility in the cost of natural gas. As of September 30, 2023, Spire Missouri had active derivative positions, but Spire Alabama has had no gas supply derivative instrument activity since 2010. The Utilities believe they will continue to be able to obtain sufficient gas supply. The price of natural gas supplies and other economic conditions may affect sales volumes, due to the conservation efforts of customers, and cash flows associated with the timing of collection of gas costs and related accounts receivable from customers. 
 
 The Utilities rely on short-term credit and long-term capital markets, as well as cash flows from operations, to satisfy their seasonal cash requirements and fund their capital expenditures. The Utilities access the commercial paper market through a program administered by the holding company, which then loans borrowed funds to the Utilities. The Utilities directly access the long-term bond market. Access to debt markets is dependent on current conditions in the credit and capital markets. Management focuses on maintaining a strong balance sheet and believes the Utilities currently have adequate access to credit and capital markets and will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet their foreseeable obligations. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional information.

Gas Marketing 
 
 Spire Marketing utilizes its natural gas supply agreements, transportation agreements, park and loan agreements, storage agreements and other executory contracts to support a variety of services to its customers at competitive prices. It closely monitors and manages the natural gas commodity price and volatility risks associated with providing such services to its customers through the use of a variety of risk management activities, including the use of exchange-traded/cleared derivative instruments and other contractual arrangements. Spire Marketing is committed to managing commodity price risk while it seeks to expand the services that it now provides. Nevertheless, income from the Gas Marketing operations is subject to more fluctuations in market conditions than the Utilities operations. 
 
 The Gas Marketing business is directly impacted by the effects of competition in the marketplace, the impacts of new infrastructure, surplus natural gas supplies, and the addition of new demand from exports, power generation and industrial load. Spire Marketing s management expects a growing need for marketing services across the country as customers manage seasonal variability and marketplace volatility. 
 
 In addition to its own operating cash flows, Spire Marketing relies on Spire s parental guaranties to secure its purchase and sales obligations of natural gas, and it also has access to Spire s liquidity resources. A large portion of Spire Marketing s receivables are from customers in the energy industry. It also enters into netting arrangements with many of its energy counterparties to reduce overall credit and collateral exposure. On a net dollar exposure basis, the majority of Spire Marketing s customers are utilities or utility affiliates. Although Spire Marketing s uncollectible amounts are closely monitored and have not been significant, increases in uncollectible amounts from customers are possible and could adversely affect Spire Marketing s liquidity and results of operations. 
 
 Spire Marketing carefully monitors the creditworthiness of counterparties to its transactions. It performs in-house credit reviews of potential customers and may require credit assurances such as prepayments, letters of credit or parental guaranties when appropriate. Credit limits for customers are established and monitored. 
 
 Spire Marketing cannot be certain that all of its wholesale purchase and sale transactions will settle physically. As such, these transactions are designated as trading activities for financial reporting purposes, due to their settlement characteristics. Results of operations from trading activities are reported on a net basis in natural gas expenses. 
 
 In the course of its business, Spire Marketing enters into commitments associated with the purchase or sale of natural gas. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, some of its purchase and sale transactions are not recognized in earnings until the natural gas is physically delivered, while other energy-related transactions, including those designated as trading activities, are required to be accounted for as derivatives with the changes in their fair value (representing unrealized gains or losses) recorded in earnings in periods prior to settlement. Because related transactions of a purchase and sale strategy may be accounted for differently, there may be timing differences in the recognition of earnings under GAAP and economic earnings realized upon settlement. The Company reports both GAAP and net economic earnings (non-GAAP), as discussed in the section Non-GAAP Measures . 
 
 Midstream 
 
 In its Midstream segment, Spire seeks to drive growth through supporting natural gas grid reliability, the ability to manage exposure to gas price volatility, and providing access to key supply basins for the shipment of natural gas. These transportation and storage operations serve a variety of natural gas customers, including Spire s other businesses. 
 
 Absolute natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment, but there is a relationship between natural gas prices and the revenues derived from the transportation and storage of natural gas. Natural gas price trends and demand for natural gas influence these price relationships through market volatility or changes in absolute prices of one supply/market point to another. Further, natural gas price differences between the various hubs Spire serves could influence the volumes of gas transported or stored on Spire s system and the related transportation and storage rates. 
 
 Spire carefully monitors the creditworthiness of counterparties to its transactions. It performs in-house credit reviews of potential customers and may require credit assurances such as prepayments, letters of credit or parental guaranties when appropriate. Credit limits for customers are established and monitored.

NON-GAAP MEASURES 
 
 Net income, earnings per share and operating income reported by Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama are determined in accordance with GAAP. Spire, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama also provide the non-GAAP financial measures of net economic earnings, net economic earnings per share and contribution margin. Management and the Board of Directors use non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting, to determine incentive compensation and to evaluate financial performance. These non-GAAP operating metrics should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, the related GAAP measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided on the following pages. 
 
 Net Economic Earnings and Net Economic Earnings Per Share 
 
 Net economic earnings and net economic earnings per share are non-GAAP measures that exclude from net income, as applicable, the impacts of fair value accounting and timing adjustments associated with energy-related transactions, the impacts of acquisition, divestiture and restructuring activities, and the largely non-cash impacts of impairments and other non-recurring or unusual items such as certain regulatory, legislative or GAAP standard-setting actions. In addition, net economic earnings per share would exclude the impact, in the fiscal year of issuance, of any shares issued to finance acquisitions that have yet to be included in net economic earnings. 
 
 The fair value and timing adjustments are made in instances where the accounting treatment differs from what management considers the economic substance of the underlying transaction, including the following: 

Net unrealized gains and losses on energy-related derivatives that are required by GAAP fair value accounting associated with current changes in the fair value of financial and physical transactions prior to their completion and settlement. These unrealized gains and losses result primarily from two sources: 

1) 
 changes in the fair values of physical and/or financial derivatives prior to the period of settlement; and 

2) 
 ineffective portions of accounting hedges, required to be recorded in earnings prior to settlement, due to differences in commodity price changes between the locations of the forecasted physical purchase or sale transactions and the locations of the underlying hedge instruments; 

Lower of cost or market adjustments to the carrying value of commodity inventories resulting when the net realizable value of the commodity falls below its original cost, to the extent that those commodities are economically hedged; and 

Realized gains and losses resulting from the settlement of economic hedges prior to the sale of the physical commodity. 

These adjustments eliminate the impact of timing differences and the impact of current changes in the fair value of financial and physical transactions prior to their completion and settlement. Unrealized gains or losses are recorded in each period until being replaced with the actual gains or losses realized when the associated physical transactions occur. Management believes that excluding the earnings volatility caused by recognizing changes in fair value prior to settlement and other timing differences associated with related purchase and sale transactions provides a useful representation of the economic effects of only the actual settled transactions and their effects on results of operations. While management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate all of its businesses, the net effect of these fair value and timing adjustments on the Utilities earnings is minimal because gains or losses on their natural gas derivative instruments are deferred pursuant to state regulation. 
 
 Contribution Margin 
 
 In addition to operating revenues and operating expenses, management also uses the non-GAAP measure of contribution margin when evaluating results of operations. Contribution margin is defined as operating revenues less natural gas costs and gross receipts tax expense. The Utilities pass to their customers (subject to prudence review by, as applicable, the MoPSC, APSC or MSPSC) increases and decreases in the wholesale cost of natural gas in accordance with their PGA clauses or GSA riders. The volatility of the wholesale natural gas market results in fluctuations from period to period in the recorded levels of, among other items, revenues and natural gas cost expense. Nevertheless, increases and decreases in the cost of gas associated with system gas sales volumes and gross receipts tax expense (which are calculated as a percentage of revenues), with the same amount (excluding immaterial timing differences) included in revenues, have no direct effect on operating income. Therefore, management believes that contribution margin is a useful supplemental measure, along with the remaining operating expenses, for assessing the Company s and the Utilities performance.

(20.1) 

The increase in interest expense reflects the significant increase in short-term interest rates and higher long-term debt levels versus the prior year, combined with higher average levels of short-term borrowings in the current year. Weighted-average short-term interest rates were 5.0 in the current year, versus 1.1 in the prior year. 
 
 The change in other income was 22.6 after removing the impact of the Postretirement Non-Service Cost Transfer (NSC Transfer) of 9.5. This increase was driven primarily by Spire Missouri, the result of increased inventory carrying-cost credits combined with favorable mark-to-market valuations on non-qualified retirement trusts. The year-over-year growth also benefited from investment gains experienced by other subsidiaries. 
 
 Income tax expense decreased 20.1. The current year benefited from lower pre-tax income and a one-time tax credit study, while the prior year included 4.1 expense related to the 2021 Missouri rate order. 
 
 Gas Utility 
 
 For the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, Gas Utility net income was 1.9 higher than the prior-year period, as the 2.6 and 1.8 growth at Spire Missouri and Spire EnergySouth, respectively, was partly offset by the 2.5 decrease at Spire Alabama. Net economic earnings in the current year was 2.2 lower than the prior year, which tracks net income after removing the Spire Missouri 4.1 GAAP regulatory tax adjustment in the prior-year period. These results are described in further detail below. 
 
 The increase in Gas Utility operating revenues for fiscal 2023 was attributable to the following factors: 

Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama Higher PGA/GSA gas cost recoveries 

436.1 

Spire Missouri 2021 and 2022 rate case outcomes

Total Variation 

510.8 

The primary driver of revenue growth in the current year was 436.1 in higher gas cost recoveries at the utilities of Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, reflecting higher average gas costs being passed through to customers. The current year also benefited from a 60.7 increase at Spire Missouri resulting from the current-year impacts of the 2022 and 2021 rate orders. The current year results also include 22.0 in net favorable rate adjustments under the RSE mechanism at Spire Alabama, higher gross receipts taxes of 21.5 at Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, growth of 6.9 at Spire EnergySouth, and favorable volume/usage of 4.1 at Spire Missouri. These benefits were only partly offset by a 30.6 reduction due to volume/usage at Spire Alabama, and a combined 12.3 reduction in off-system sales between Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama.

Total Variation 

88.1 

The contribution margin growth was primarily driven by the 60.7 increase from the Spire Missouri 2022 and 2021 rate order implementations, 19.6 from favorable rate adjustments within the RSE framework at Spire Alabama, and a 3.3 increase at Spire EnergySouth. The 5.4 favorable volume impact at Spire Missouri was partly offset by the 2.2 volume decline at Spire Alabama, both net of weather mitigation impacts. 
 
 O M expenses for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, were 48.5 higher than the prior year. Expenses increased 15.4 after removing the 9.1 impact of the NSC Transfer and approximately 24 due to the change in treatment of Spire Missouri general overheads that were being deferred in the prior-year period. The O M increase was driven by a 22.1 increase in operations and customer experience costs and a 5.0 increase in bad debt expense. These increases were only partly offset by a 5.3 reduction in outside services, favorable administrative and general (A G) expenses, and lower employee-related expenses. 
 
 Taxes, other than income taxes, increased 34.1, and were driven by 21.9 in higher pass-through gross receipts taxes, along with higher property taxes resulting from the continued infrastructure build-out by the Utilities. Depreciation and amortization expenses for fiscal 2023 were 16.5 higher than the same period in the prior year primarily driven by continued infrastructure capital expenditures across all the Utilities. 
 
 Gas Marketing 
 
 Net income growth of 3.5 reflects the strong operating results experienced in the current-year, driven by favorable market conditions in the first half of fiscal 2023 that allowed the business to take advantage of regional basis differentials to optimize storage and transportation positions. These gains were partly offset by unfavorable year-over-year after-tax unrealized fair market value adjustments of 17.1, and slightly higher O M costs associated with higher employee-related expenses. Net economic earnings exceeds net income growth as net economic earnings excludes the impacts of the unrealized fair market value adjustments. 
 
 The decline in operating revenues primarily reflects lower commodity pricing in fiscal 2023 versus the prior year. 
 
 Gas Marketing contribution margin increased 7.8 from the same period last year, driven by incremental optimization of storage and transportation assets in the current year, which were only partly offset by unfavorable year-over-year fair value adjustments of 22.8. 
 
 Midstream 
 
 Net income and net economic earnings for the Company s Midstream segment increased 0.9 and 3.0, respectively, for the year ended September 30, 2023 versus the prior-year period. Strong net income performance at Spire Storage West reflecting optimized operational and withdrawal commitments that were partly offset by the acquisition of Spire Storage Salt Plains, whose impacts are excluded from net economic earnings. 
 
 The 13.0 increase in operating revenues and contribution margin is attributable to the 8.1 growth at Spire Storage West and to the Spire Storage Salt Plains acquisition in April 2023. The O M increase of 8.3 is driven by a 2.1 increase at Spire Storage West supporting the higher level of billable storage activity, with the remaining increase due principally to Spire Storage Salt Plains operations as well as acquisition and transaction costs for the previously announced and pending Missouri Gas Company (MoGas) acquisition.

Other 
 
 The Company s other activities incurred a 34.1 loss for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, 9.6 higher than the prior-year period. The larger current-year loss was driven by higher interest expense, reflecting both higher borrowings and interest rates, combined with higher corporate costs, partly offset by lower income tax expense.

Operating revenues for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 were 441.9 higher than the comparable prior-year period. A key driver was an increase in gas recovery costs totaling 362.3. Further, 60.7 of the increase attributable to fiscal 2023 results represent the cumulative impacts of the implementation of the 2022 and 2021 rate orders. Higher gross receipts taxes contributed a 17.1 increase, and volume (net of weather mitigation) contributed 4.1 growth. These revenue growth drivers were only partially offset by lower off-system sales of 5.2. 
 
 Temperatures in Spire Missouri s service areas during fiscal 2023 were 1.4 warmer than during fiscal 2022 and 10.4 warmer than normal. The Spire Missouri total system volume sold and transported was 1,592.0 million centum of cubic feet (CCF) for the year ended September 30, 2023, compared with 1,602.8 million CCF last year. Total off-system volume sold and transported was 14.5 million CCF for fiscal 2023, compared with 19.1 million for fiscal 2022. 
 
 Contribution margin for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 increased 68.4 from the same period in the prior year. The increase was the result of the previously mentioned timing of the 2022 and 2021 rate case implementations generating 60.7 incremental contribution margin, combined with favorable volumetric impacts of 5.4. 
 
 Reported O M expenses for the current year period increased 40.5 versus the prior year. Expenses increased 8.6 after removing the 7.9 impact of the NSC Transfer and the approximately 24 of general overheads that were deferred in the prior year. The increase reflects higher non-employee operations expense of 14.7 and higher bad debt expense of 2.2, partly offset by lower outside service costs and favorable A G expenses in the current year. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses were up 13.4, the result of continued investment in infrastructure upgrades. Other income was higher by 18.4, after removing the 7.9 due to the NSC Transfer. This variance is primarily attributable to increased natural gas inventory carrying cost credits, combined with favorable mark-to-market valuations on non-qualified retirement trusts. Interest expense increased 36.5, primarily reflecting higher short-term interest rates and net long-term debt issuances in the current year. 
 
 Net income increased 2.6 over the comparable prior-year period.

The 62.0 increase in operating revenues reflects a 73.8 increase in gas cost recoveries pursuant to the GSA mechanism, 22.0 higher net rate adjustments under the RSE mechanism, and higher gross receipts taxes of 4.4. These favorable impacts were partly offset by a 30.6 reduction attributable to weather/volumetric impacts, and a 7.1 decrease in off-system sales. 
 
 Temperatures in Spire Alabama s service area during fiscal 2023 were 10.7 warmer than during fiscal 2022 and 18.8 warmer than normal. Spire Alabama s total system volume sold and transported was 1,026.2 million CCF during the year ended September 30, 2023, compared with 1,010.8 million CCF during the prior year. Off-system sales volume for fiscal 2023 totaled 98.8 million CCF compared with 63.1 million CCF for fiscal 2022. 
 
 Contribution margin increased 16.4, which was principally a result of net favorable RSE adjustments of 19.6. This growth was tempered by unfavorable weather/volumetric impacts totaling 2.2, after applying weather mitigation. 
 
 Excluding the impact of the NSC Transfer of 1.1, the increase in O M of 5.2 was largely due to a 2.3 increase in bad debt expense. Depreciation expense was up 2.5 reflecting the continued infrastructure investments in the service territory. 
 
 The variance in other income is primarily the impact of the year-over-year change in the NSC Transfer. Interest expense increased 13.6, primarily reflecting higher short-term interest rates and long-term debt issuances in the current year. Resulting fiscal 2023 net income declined 2.5 versus fiscal 2022.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased 385.2 from 2022 to 2023 after decreasing 194.8 from 2021 to 2022. In addition to the changes in net income between the respective periods (discussed above), the remaining changes were related to regulatory timing and fluctuations in working capital items, as discussed below in the Future Cash Requirements section. Specifically, the timing and amounts of regulatory adjustments for purchased gas costs resulted in a large change in deferred recovery in 2022, greatly reducing net cash provided by operating activities that year. 

35

Table of Contents 

In 2023, the Company's net cash used in investing activities was 148.8 more than in 2022, primarily driven by a 110.3 increase in capital expenditures and the 37.0 acquisition of Spire Storage Salt Plains. Capital expenditures increased 60.0 in the Gas Utility segment (primarily due to meter and other infrastructure upgrades) and 51.0 in the Midstream segment (primarily due to the ongoing Wyoming storage facility expansion). 
 
 In 2022, the Company used 75.3 less cash in investing activities than in 2021, primarily driven by a 72.6 decrease in capital expenditures, with Gas Utility down 61.8 and Midstream down 10.4. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was down 240.3 in 2023 compared to 2022 as a result of lower net debt issuances, lower common stock issuances, and higher dividends. Although the net increase in long-term debt was 473.8 in fiscal 2023 compared to only 244.2 in fiscal 2022, Spire reduced short-term debt by 82.0 in fiscal 2023 after increasing short-term borrowings 365.5 in 2022. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was up 121.5 in 2022 compared to 2021. As noted above, 2022 net short-term debt issuances were 365.5, which was 341.5 higher than in 2021. In addition, the combination of lower net repayments of long-term debt 59.6) and higher cash generated from the issuance of common stock 50.9) in 2022 contributed 110.5 to the year-over-year increase. A significant offset to these increases was a 329.1 decline in cash generated from the issuance of long-term debt, coupled with 8.7 higher common stock dividend payments. 
 
 Future Cash Requirements 
 
 The Company s short-term borrowing requirements typically peak during colder months when the Utilities borrow money to cover the lag between when they purchase natural gas and when their customers pay for that gas. Changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas (including cash payments for margin deposits associated with Spire Missouri s use of natural gas derivative instruments), variations in the timing of collections of gas cost under the Utilities PGA clauses and GSA riders, the seasonality of accounts receivable balances, and the utilization of stored gas inventories cause short-term cash requirements to vary during the year and from year to year, and may cause significant variations in the Company s cash provided by or used in operating activities. 
 
 Spire s material cash requirements as of September 30, 2023, are related to capital expenditures, principal and interest payments on long-term debt, natural gas purchase obligations, and common and preferred stock dividends. 
 
 Total Company capital expenditures are planned to be 765 for fiscal 2024, though Spire had purchase commitments for less than a quarter of these as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 As detailed in Note 6 , Long-Term Debt, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8, 156.6 of the total 3,732.7 principal amount is due in fiscal 2024. Using each long-term debt instrument s stated maturity and fixed rates or variable rates as of September 30, 2023, interest payments are projected to total 1,817.3, of which 150.7 is due in fiscal 2024. 
 
 Spire s natural gas purchase obligations totaled 1,613.2, including 650.1 for fiscal 2024, representing the minimum payments required under existing natural gas transportation and storage contracts and natural gas supply agreements. The amounts reflect fixed obligations as well as obligations to purchase natural gas at future market prices, calculated using forward market prices as of September 30, 2023. Each of the Utilities generally recovers costs related to its purchases, transportation and storage of natural gas through the operation of its PGA clause or GSA rider, subject to prudence review by the appropriate regional public service commission. Additional contractual commitments are generally entered into prior to or during the heating season. 
 
 Spire dividends declared and payable as of September 30, 2023, totaled 43.1, while annualized dividends based on the regular quarterly amounts declared on November 10, 2023, are estimated at 175.3. 
 
 Spire will pay 175 cash, subject to customary working capital and other closing adjustments, to acquire MoGas Pipeline, an interstate natural gas pipeline, and Omega Pipeline, a connected gas distribution system, from CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc. if the transaction closes (currently anticipated in the second quarter of fiscal 2024). For further discussion of this pending acquisition, see Note 16 , Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following represent the more significant items requiring the use of judgment and estimates in preparing our financial statements: 
 
 Regulatory Accounting The Utilities account for their regulated operations in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 980, Regulated Operations . The provisions of this accounting guidance require, among other things, that financial statements of a rate-regulated enterprise reflect the actions of regulators, where appropriate. These actions may result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in time periods that are different than non-rate-regulated enterprises. When this occurs, costs are deferred as assets in the balance sheet (regulatory assets) and recorded as expenses when those amounts are reflected in rates. Also, regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and for recovery of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future (regulatory liabilities). Management believes that the current regulatory environment supports the continued use of these regulatory accounting principles and that all regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory process. For Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, management believes the following represent the more significant items recorded through the application of this accounting guidance: 
 
 PGA Clause Spire Missouri s PGA clauses allows it to flow through to customers, subject to a prudence review by the MoPSC, the cost of purchased gas supplies, including the costs, cost reductions and related carrying costs associated with the use of natural gas derivative instruments to hedge the purchase price of natural gas. The difference between actual costs incurred and costs recovered through the application of the PGA clauses are recorded as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities that are recovered or refunded in a subsequent period. The PGA clauses also permit the application of carrying costs to all over- or under-recoveries of gas costs, including costs and cost reductions associated with the use of derivative instruments, and also provide for a portion of income from off-system sales and capacity release revenues to be flowed through to customers. 
 
 GSA Rider Spire Alabama s rate schedules for natural gas distribution charges contain a GSA rider, established in 1993, which permits the pass-through to customers of changes in the cost of gas supply. Spire Alabama s tariff provides a temperature adjustment mechanism, also included in the GSA, that is designed to moderate the impact of departures from normal temperatures on Spire Alabama s earnings. The temperature adjustment applies primarily to residential, small commercial and small industrial customers. Other non-temperature weather related conditions that may affect customer usage are not included in the temperature adjustment. In prior years, Spire Alabama entered into cash flow derivative commodity instruments to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on its gas supply. Spire Alabama recognizes all derivatives at fair value as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. Any realized gains or losses are passed through to customers using the mechanisms of the GSA rider in accordance with Spire Alabama s APSC approved tariff and are recognized as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. All derivative commodity instruments in a gain position are valued on a discounted basis incorporating an estimate of performance risk specific to each related counterparty. Derivative commodity instruments in a loss position are valued on a discounted basis incorporating an estimate of performance risk specific to Spire Alabama. Spire Alabama currently has no active gas supply derivative positions. 
 
 ISRS The ISRS allows Spire Missouri expedited recovery for its investment to upgrade its infrastructure and enhance its safety and reliability without the necessity of a formal rate case. Spire Missouri records ISRS revenues as authorized by the MoPSC and estimates the probability and amount of any refunds based on commission precedent, current legal rulings, the opinion of legal counsel, and other considerations.

Table of Contents 

Employee Benefits and Postretirement Obligations Pension and postretirement obligations are calculated by actuarial consultants that utilize several statistical factors and other assumptions provided by management related to future events, such as discount rates, returns on plan assets, compensation increases, and mortality rates. For the Utilities, the amount of expense recognized and the amounts reflected in other comprehensive income are dependent upon the regulatory treatment provided for such costs, as discussed further below. Certain liabilities related to group medical benefits and workers compensation claims, portions of which are self-insured and/or contain stop-loss coverage with third-party insurers to limit exposure, are established based on historical trends. 
 
 The amount of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs recognized in the financial statements related to the Utilities qualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans is based upon allowances, as approved by the MoPSC (for Spire Missouri) and as approved by the APSC (for Spire Alabama). The allowances have been established in the rate-making process for the recovery of these costs from customers. The differences between these amounts and actual pension and other postretirement benefit costs incurred for financial reporting purposes are deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. GAAP also requires that changes that affect the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans, but that are not yet required to be recognized as components of pension and other postretirement benefit costs, be reflected in other comprehensive income. For the Utilities qualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, amounts that would otherwise be reflected in other comprehensive income are deferred with entries to regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities.

Income Taxes Income tax calculations require estimates due to book-tax differences, estimates with respect to regulatory treatment of certain items, and uncertainty in the interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Critical assumptions and judgments also include projections of future taxable income to determine the ability to utilize net operating losses and credit carryforwards prior to their expiration. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Management regularly assesses financial statement tax provisions to identify any change in regulatory treatment or tax related estimates and assumptions that could have a material impact on cash flows, financial position and/or results of operations. For more information, see Note 12 , Income Taxes, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8.

 MARKET RISK 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 Gas Utility 
 
 The Utilities commodity price risk, which arises from market fluctuations in the price of natural gas, is primarily managed through the operation of Spire Missouri s PGA clauses and Spire Alabama s GSA rider. The PGA clauses and GSA rider allows the Utilities to flow through to customers, subject to prudence review by the MoPSC and APSC, the cost of purchased gas supplies. Spire Missouri is allowed the flexibility to make up to three discretionary PGA changes during each year, in addition to its mandatory November PGA change, so long as such changes are separated by at least two months. Spire Missouri is able to mitigate, to some extent, changes in commodity prices through the use of physical storage supplies and regional supply diversity. Spire Alabama is allowed to make monthly changes to the GSA rate, but increases cannot exceed a 5 increase over the prior effective residential billing rate. The Utilities also have risk management policies that allow for the purchase of natural gas derivative instruments with the goal of managing its price risk associated with purchasing natural gas on behalf of its customers. These policies prohibit speculation. As of September 30, 2023, Spire Missouri had active natural gas derivative positions, but Spire Alabama did not. Costs and cost reduction, including carrying costs, associated with the use of natural gas derivative instruments are allowed to be passed on to customers through the operation of the PGA clauses or GSA rider. Accordingly, the Utilities do not expect any adverse earnings impact as a result of the use of these derivative instruments. However, the timing of recovery for cash payments related to margin requirements may cause short-term cash requirements to vary. For more information about the Utilities natural gas derivative instruments, see Note 10 , Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. 
 
 Gas Marketing 
 
 In the course of its business, Spire s non-regulated gas marketing subsidiary, Spire Marketing, enters into contracts to purchase and sell natural gas at fixed prices and natural gas index-based prices. Commodity price risk associated with these contracts has the potential to impact earnings and cash flows. To minimize this risk, Spire Marketing has a risk management policy that provides for daily monitoring of a number of business measures, including fixed price commitments. In accordance with the risk management policy, Spire Marketing manages the price risk associated with its fixed price commitments. This risk is currently managed either by closely matching the offsetting physical purchase or sale of natural gas at fixed-prices or through the use of natural gas futures, options and swap contracts traded on or cleared through the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) to lock in margins. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, Spire Marketing s unmatched fixed-price positions were not material to Spire s financial position or results of operations.

Table of Contents 

As mentioned above, Spire Marketing uses natural gas futures, options and swap contracts traded on or cleared through the NYMEX and ICE to manage the commodity price risk associated with its fixed-price natural gas purchase and sale commitments. These derivative instruments may be designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted purchases or sales. Such accounting treatment, if elected, generally permits a substantial portion of the gain or loss to be deferred from recognition in earnings until the period that the associated forecasted purchase or sale is recognized in earnings. To the extent a hedge is effective, gains or losses on the derivatives will be offset by changes in the value of the hedged forecasted transactions. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, Spire Marketing had no designated cash flow hedges.

Certain of Spire Marketing s physical natural gas derivative contracts are designated as normal purchases or normal sales, as permitted by GAAP. This election permits the Company to account for the contract in the period the natural gas is delivered. Contracts not designated as normal purchases or normal sales, including those designated as trading activities, are accounted for as derivatives with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in the periods prior to settlement.

Table of Contents 

Counterparty Credit Risk 
 
 Spire Marketing has concentrations of counterparty credit risk in that a significant portion of its transactions are with energy producers, utility companies and pipelines. These concentrations of counterparties have the potential to affect the Company s overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that each of these three groups may be affected similarly by changes in economic, industry or other conditions. Spire Marketing also has concentrations of credit risk with certain individually significant counterparties. To the extent possible, Spire Marketing enters into netting arrangements with its counterparties to mitigate exposure to credit risk. It is also exposed to credit risk associated with its derivative contracts designated as normal purchases and normal sales. Spire Marketing closely monitors its credit exposure and, although uncollectible amounts have not been significant, increased counterparty defaults are possible and may result in financial losses and/or capital limitations. For more information on these and other concentrations of credit risk, including how Spire Marketing manages these risks, see Note 11 , Concentrations of Credit Risk, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 The Company is subject to interest rate risk associated with its short-term debt issuances. Based on average short-term borrowings during fiscal 2023, an increase of 100 basis points in the underlying average interest rate for short-term debt would have caused an increase in interest expense (and a decrease in pre-tax earnings and cash flows) of approximately 8.4 on an annual basis. Portions of such an increase may be offset through the Utilities application of PGA and GSA carrying costs. At September 30, 2023, Spire had fixed-rate long-term debt totaling 3,432.7, of which 1,498.0 was issued by Spire Missouri, 750.0 was issued by Spire Alabama, and 1,184.7 was issued by Spire and other subsidiaries. While the long-term debt issues are fixed-rate, they are subject to changes in fair value as market interest rates change. However, increases or decreases in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the Company were to reacquire any of these issues in the open market prior to maturity. Under GAAP applicable to the Utilities regulated operations, losses or gains on early redemptions of long-term debt would typically be deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities and amortized over a future period.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Spire Inc. 
 
 Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Spire Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023, of the Company and our report dated November 16, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for their assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Spire Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Spire Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 16, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matter 
 
 The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 
 
 Regulatory Matters Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements Refer to Note 15 to the financial statements 
 
 Critical Audit Matter Description 
 
 The Company accounts for their regulated operations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 980, Regulated Operations . The provisions of this accounting guidance require, among other things, that financial statements of a rate-regulated enterprise reflect the actions of regulators, where appropriate. These actions may result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in time periods that are different than non-rate-regulated enterprises. When this occurs, costs are deferred as assets in the balance sheet (regulatory assets) and recorded as expenses when those amounts are reflected in rates. Also, regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and for recovery of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future (regulatory liabilities). 

46

Table of Contents 

The Company is subject to rate regulation by the Missouri and Alabama Public Service Commissions (the Commissions ), which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of natural gas companies within their respective geographies. The Company has stated that all regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory process. 
 
 Accounting for the economics of rate regulation affects multiple financial statement line items, including property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; and depreciation expense, and affects multiple disclosures in the Company s financial statements. There is a risk that the Commissions will not approve full recovery of the costs of providing utility service or recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. As a result, we identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of current and future regulatory orders on events that have occurred as of September 30, 2023, and the judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures. Management judgments included assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs or (2) refunds to customers or future reduction in rates. Given that management s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these rate-impacted account balances and disclosures, and the related judgments, requires specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation due to the inherent complexities associated with the specialized rules related to accounting for the effects of cost-based regulation. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others: 
 
 We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over evaluating the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. 
 
 We evaluated the Company s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments, in the financial statements. 
 
 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company in Missouri, Alabama, and Mississippi; regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, and filings made by interveners; and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. 
 
 We obtained from management the regulatory orders that support the probability of recovery, refund, and/or future reduction in rates for regulatory assets and liabilities and assessed management s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates.

 Accounting for the economics of rate regulation affects multiple financial statement line items, including property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; and depreciation expense, and affects multiple disclosures in the Company s financial statements. There is a risk that the Commission will not approve full recovery of the costs of providing utility service or recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. As a result, we identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of current and future regulatory orders on events that have occurred as of September 30, 2023, and the judgments made by management to support their assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures. Management judgments included assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs or (2) refunds to customers or future reduction in rates. Given that management s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commission, auditing these rate-impacted account balances and disclosures, and the related judgments, requires specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation due to the inherent complexities associated with the specialized rules related to accounting for the effects of cost-based regulation. 
 
 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
 
 Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commission included the following, among others: 
 
 We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over evaluating the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We tested the effectiveness of management s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates. 
 We evaluated the Company s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments, in the financial statements. 
 We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commission for the Company in Alabama; regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, and filings made by interveners; and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commission s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. 
 We obtained from management the regulatory orders that support the probability of recovery, refund, and/or future reduction in rates for regulatory assets and liabilities and assessed management s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates.

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Dollars in millions, except per share, per unit and per gallon amounts) 

reportable segments: Gas Utility, Gas Marketing, and Midstream. The Gas Utility segment consists of the regulated natural gas distribution operations of the Company and is the core business segment of Spire in terms of revenue and earnings. The Gas Utility segment is comprised of the operations of: Spire Missouri, serving St. Louis, Kansas City, and other areas in Missouri; Spire Alabama, serving central and northern Alabama; and the subsidiaries of Spire EnergySouth, serving the Mobile, Alabama area and south-central Mississippi. The Gas Marketing segment includes Spire s primary gas-related business, Spire Marketing Inc. Spire Marketing ), which provides non-regulated natural gas services throughout the United States (U.S.). The Midstream segment includes Spire STL Pipeline and Spire Storage, which are subsidiaries engaged in the transportation and storage of natural gas. The activities of the Company s other subsidiaries are reported as Other and are described in Note 14 , Information by Operating Segment. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama each have a single reportable segment. 

of the original cost of depreciable and amortizable property. 
 
 Non-utility Property Non-utility property is recorded at the original cost of acquisition or construction, which includes material, labor, contractor services and, for FERC-regulated projects, an allowance for funds used during construction. Repairs, replacements and renewals of items of property determined to be less than a unit of property or that do not increase the property s life or functionality are charged to maintenance expense. Upon retirement or sale of non-utility property, the original cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in the income statements. Costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related software. If software is retired prior to being fully amortized, the difference is recorded as a loss in the income statements.

. The replacement cost of Spire Missouri s natural gas for current use in eastern Missouri at September 30, 2022 was more than the LIFO cost by . The carrying value of the Utilities inventory is never adjusted to a lower net realizable value or market value because, pursuant to Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clauses or a Gas Supply Adjustment (GSA) rider, actual gas costs are recovered in customer rates. Natural gas and propane gas storage inventory in Spire s other operating segments is recorded at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. 
 
 , zero, and zero, respectively, with the remainder held at the corporate level. Goodwill amounts have not changed since fiscal 2017, and there are no accumulated impairment losses. Spire and Spire Missouri evaluate goodwill for impairment as of July 1 of each year, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. At each test date, the assessments concluded that goodwill was not impaired. The Company updated the assessments as of September 30, 2023 , determining that it remained more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. 
 
 A subsidiary of Spire in the Midstream segment acquired a natural gas storage facility in northern Oklahoma, now named Spire Storage Salt Plains LLC, on April 1, 2023. The purchase price was fully allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair value at the acquisition date, consisting almost entirely of base gas and other property, plant and equipment, resulting in no goodwill. 

and of restricted cash reported in Other Investments on the Company s balance sheet as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 , respectively (in addition to amounts shown as Cash and cash equivalents ). This restricted cash has been segregated and invested in debt securities in a trust account based on collateral requirements for reinsurance at Spire s risk management company.

FINANCE RECEIVABLES Spire Alabama finances third party contractor sales of merchandise including gas furnaces and appliances. At September 30, 2023 and 2022 , Spire Alabama s finance receivable totaled approximately and , respectively. Financing is available only to qualified customers who meet creditworthiness thresholds for customer payment history and external agency credit reports. Spire Alabama relies upon ongoing payments as the primary indicator of credit quality during the term of each contract. The allowance for credit losses is recognized using an estimate of write-off percentages based on historical experience. Delinquent accounts are evaluated on a case-by-case basis and, absent evidence of debt repayment, after 90 days are due in full and assigned to a third -party collection agency. The remaining finance receivable is written off approximately 12 months after being assigned to the third -party collection agency. Spire Alabama had finance receivables past due 90 days or more of at September 30, 2023 and 2022 .

The Utilities sell natural gas to residential and other customers. The sale of natural gas is governed by the various state utility commissions, which set rates, charges, and terms and conditions of service, collectively included in a tariff. The performance obligation, which relates to the promise to provide natural gas, is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the natural gas, and revenue is recognized accordingly. 
 
 The Utilities transportation revenue relates to the promise to transport the specified quantities of natural gas at tariff rates. This performance obligation is satisfied over time as the gas is transported, and revenue is recognized as invoiced monthly. 

The Utilities have alternative revenue programs (ARPs), which represent an agreement between the utility and its regulator, currently consisting of decoupling mechanisms (also known as weather normalization adjustments) and incentive programs (primarily Alabama s Cost Control Measure). When the criteria to recognize additional (or reduced) revenue from ARPs have been met, the Utilities establish a regulatory asset (or liability). When amounts previously recognized for ARPs are billed, the Utilities reduce the regulatory asset (or liability) and increase (or decrease) accounts receivable. Billed amounts, which are part of the overall tariff paid by customers, are included in revenue from contracts with customers, while the change in the related regulatory asset or liability is presented as revenue from ARPs. Depending on whether the beginning accrued ARP balance was a regulatory asset or liability and depending on the size and direction of the current period accrual, the amount presented as revenue from ARPs could be negative. 
 
 The Utilities read meters and bill customers on monthly cycles. Spire Missouri, Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi record their gas utility revenues from gas sales and transportation services on an accrual basis that includes estimated amounts for gas delivered but not yet billed. The accruals for unbilled revenues are reversed in the subsequent accounting period when meters are actually read and customers are billed. Spire Alabama records natural gas distribution revenues in accordance with the tariff established by the APSC. Unbilled revenue is accrued in an amount equal to the related gas cost, as profit margin is not considered earned until billed. Spire s other subsidiaries, including Spire Marketing, record revenues when earned, as the product is delivered or as services are performed. 
 
 Gas Marketing s contracts are derivatives. Wholesale contracts (with producers, municipalities, and utility companies) are subject to derivative accounting. Retail contracts (with large commercial and industrial customers) are designated as normal purchase, normal sale arrangements and are therefore accounted for as revenue from contracts with customers. The performance obligation is satisfied over time by the transfer of control of natural gas to the customer, and revenue is recognized as invoiced monthly. 
 
 Payments are generally required within 30 days of billing, and contracts generally do not have a significant financing component. Spire s revenues are not subject to significant returns, refunds, or warranty obligations. 
 
 Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama have elected to apply a right to invoice practical expedient, recognizing revenue for volumes delivered for which they have a right to invoice, as long as that amount corresponds with the value to the customer. Disclosures about remaining performance obligations are not required because either contracts have an original expected duration of one year or less, or revenue is recognized under the right to invoice practical expedient, or both. 
 
 Sales taxes imposed on applicable Spire Alabama and Spire Missouri sales are billed to customers. These amounts are not recorded in the statements of income but are recorded as tax collections payable and included in the Other line of the Current Liabilities section of the balance sheets. 
 
 Gross receipts taxes associated with the Company s natural gas utility services are imposed on the Company, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama and billed to its customers. The expense amounts (shown in the table below) are reported gross in the Taxes, other than income taxes line in the statements of income, and corresponding revenues are reported in Operating Revenues.

 The Company allows participants in the EIP the ability to defer a portion or all of their award. As of September 30, 2023, a total of share equivalents (at target payout) have been deferred by participants. Such units are included in the data presented below. After the required holding period, deferred awards are ultimately paid in cash rather than in shares of stock. Upon vesting, the Company issues new shares to satisfy awards that are not deferred. 
 
 Restricted Stock Awards 
 
 During fiscal 2023 , the Company grant ed performance-contingent restricted share units to executive officers and key employees at a weighted average grant date fair value of per share. This number represents the target shares that can be earned pursuant to the terms of the awards. The share units have a performance period ending September 30, 2026. While the participants have no interim voting rights on these share units, dividends accrue during the performance period and are paid to the participants upon vesting but are subject to forfeiture if the underlying share units do not vest. 
 
 The number of share units that will ultimately vest is dependent upon the attainment of certain levels of earnings, as well as the Company s level of total shareholder return (TSR) during the performance period relative to a comparator group of peer companies. This TSR provision is considered a market condition under GAAP and is discussed further below. The maximum amount of shares or share equivalents that can be earned pursuant to the terms of the awards is of the target units granted. 
 
 The weighted average grant date fair value of performance-contingent restricted share units granted during fiscal years 2022 and 2021 was and per share, respectively. 
 
 Fiscal 2023 activity of restricted stock units subject to performance and/or market conditions is presented below:

For the year ended September 30, 2023 , the total number of shares or share equivalents that could be issued if all outstanding award grants attain maximum performance payout is . 

During fiscal 2023 , the Company granted shares of time-vested restricted stock to executive officers and key employees at a weighted average grant date fair value of per share. Unless forfeited based on terms of the agreements, these shares will vest in fiscal 2025. In the interim, participants receive full voting rights and dividends, which are not subject to forfeiture. The weighted average grant date fair value of time-vested restricted stock and restricted stock units awarded to employees during fiscal years 2022 and 2021 was and per share, respectively. 
 
 During fiscal 2023 , the Company granted shares of time-vested restricted stock to non-employee directors at a weighted average grant date fair value of per share. These shares vested in fiscal 2023 , six months after the grant date. The weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock awarded to non-employee directors during fiscal years 2022 and 2021 was and per share, respectively. 
 
 Time-vested restricted stock and stock unit activity for fiscal 2023 is presented below:

For restricted stock and stock units (performance-contingent and time-vested) that vested during fiscal years 2023 , 2022 , and 2021 , the Company withheld shares, shares, and shares, respectively, at weighted average prices of , and per share, respectively, pursuant to elections by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations. The total fair value of restricted stock (performance-contingent and time-vested) that vested during fiscal years 2023 , 2022 , and 2021 was , , and , respectively, and the related tax benefit was , , and , respectively. None of the tax benefits have been realized. 

Equity Compensation Costs 
 
 Compensation cost for performance-contingent restricted stock and stock unit awards is based upon the probable outcome of the performance conditions. For shares or units that do not vest or that are not expected to vest due to the outcome of the performance conditions (excluding market conditions), no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed. 
 
 The fair value of awards of performance-contingent and time-vested restricted stock and restricted stock units, not subject to the TSR provision, are estimated using the closing price of the Company s stock on the grant date. For those awards that do not pay dividends during the vesting period, the estimate of fair value is reduced by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the Company s common stock during the performance period, discounted using an appropriate U.S. Treasury yield. For shares subject to the TSR provision, the estimated impact of this market condition is reflected in the grant date fair value per share of the awards. Accordingly, compensation cost is not reversed to reflect any actual reductions in the awards that may result from the TSR provision. However, if the Company s TSR during the performance period ranks below the level specified in the award agreements, relative to a comparator group of companies, and the Committee elects not to reduce the award (or reduce by a lesser amount), this election would be accounted for as a modification of the original award and additional compensation cost would be recognized at that time. The grant date fair value of the awards subject to the TSR provision awarded during fiscal years 2023 , 2022 and 2021 was valued by a Monte Carlo simulation model that assessed the probabilities of various TSR outcomes. The significant assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulations are as follows: 

Expected dividend yield of stock 
 Expected volatility of stock 
 Performance period (in years) 

The risk-free interest rate was based on the yield on U.S. Treasury securities matching the vesting period. A -percent dividend yield was used, which is mathematically equivalent to the assumption that dividends are reinvested as they are paid. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s stock. Volatility assumptions were also made for each of the companies included in the comparator group. The vesting period is equal to the performance period set forth in the terms of the award. 
 
 The amounts of compensation cost recognized for share-based compensation arrangements are presented below: 

Compensation cost capitalized 
 Compensation cost recognized in net income 
 Income tax benefit recognized in net income 
 Compensation cost recognized in net income, net of income tax 

As of September 30, 2023 , there was of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years.

 On May 21, 2019, Spire completed the public offering of depositary shares (the Depositary Shares ), each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of the Company s Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value per share, with a liquidation preference of per share (the Preferred Stock ). The transaction resulted in of net proceeds, after deducting commissions and sale expenses, which proceeds were used to (i) refinance long-term and short-term Spire debt and (ii) fund capital expenditures at both the Utilities and Spire s gas-related businesses. 
 
 Dividends on the Preferred Stock, when declared by the Board, are payable on the liquidation preference amount, on a cumulative basis, quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of February, May, August and November of each year, beginning on August 15, 2019. Dividends are payable out of amounts legally available for the payment of dividends at an annual rate equal to of the liquidation preference per share of Preferred Stock (equivalent to per Depositary Share). Dividends accumulate daily and are cumulative from May 21, 2019. 
 
 Under the terms of the Preferred Stock, the Company s ability to declare or pay dividends on, or purchase or redeem, shares of its common stock or any class or series of capital stock of the Company that rank junior to the Preferred Stock are subject to certain restrictions in the event that the Company does not declare and pay the full cumulative dividends on the Preferred Stock through the most recently completed quarterly dividend period. 

Spire may, at its option, redeem the Preferred Stock (i) in whole, but not in part, at any time prior to August 15, 2024, within 120 days after a ratings event where a rating agency amends, clarifies or changes the criteria it uses to assign equity credit for securities such as the Preferred Stock, at a redemption price in cash equal to per share, or (ii) in whole or in part, from time to time, on or after August 15, 2024, at a redemption price in cash equal to per share, plus, in each case, all accumulated and unpaid dividends (whether declared or not up to such redemption date. 
 
 Shareholders of the Preferred Stock generally have no voting rights with respect to matters that generally require the approval of voting stockholders. The limited voting rights of holders of the Preferred Stock include the right to vote on certain matters that may affect the preference or special rights of the Preferred Stock. In addition, if and whenever dividends on any shares of Preferred Stock have not been declared and paid for at least six dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, the number of directors then constituting the Board shall automatically be increased by two (to be elected by the holders of the Preferred Stock) until all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock have been paid in full. 
 
 Equity Units 
 
 In February 2021, Spire issued million equity units, initially in the form of Corporate Units, for an aggregate stated amount of , resulting in net proceeds (after underwriting fees and other issuance costs) of . Each Corporate Unit has a stated amount of dollars and consists of (i) a stock purchase contract and (ii) a 1/20, or , undivided beneficial ownership interest in dollars principal amount of Spire s 2021 Series A Remarketable Senior Notes due March 1, 2026 RSNs). The RSNs are pledged as collateral to secure the holder s obligation under the related stock purchase contracts. Each stock purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase, and Spire to issue and deliver, on March 1, 2024, for a price of dollars in cash, a variable number of shares of its common stock as follows (subject to anti-dilution adjustments). 

Based on the volume-weighted average price of Spire common stock during the 20 trading days before settlement. 
 
 If a holder elects to settle purchase contracts early, the holder would pay fifty dollars per unit and receive shares per unit. 
 
 The Company makes quarterly interest payments on the RSNs at the rate of per year and quarterly contract adjustment payments on the stock purchase contracts at the rate of . The RSNs and the contract adjustment payments are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of Spire s subsidiaries. 
 
 At issuance, the Company recorded the present value of the stock purchase contract payments as a liability (reflected in Other current and noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet) offset by a charge to additional paid-in capital in equity. This noncash financing activity has been excluded from the statement of cash flows. Interest payments on the RSNs are recorded as interest expense and stock purchase contract payments are charged against the liability. Accretion of the stock purchase contract liability is recorded as imputed interest expense. In calculating diluted EPS, the Company applies the treasury stock method to the Corporate Units. These securities have not had an effect on diluted EPS. 
 
 In order to secure funds necessary for the holders to pay the purchase price of the common stock on the purchase contract settlement date, the remarketing agent will remarket the RSNs on behalf of the current holders to new third -party investors. Following any successful remarketing of the RSNs, the interest rate on the RSNs will be reset, interest will be payable on a semi-annual basis, and Spire will cease to have the option to redeem the RSNs, other than in connection with the occurrence or continuance of certain special events. 

ATM Program 
 
 On February 6, 2019, Spire entered into an at-the-market (ATM) equity distribution agreement, supplemented as of May 14, 2019, pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of its common stock (including shares of common stock that may be sold pursuant to forward sale agreements entered into in connection with the ATM equity distribution agreement). On April 28, 2022, Spire's board approved a new authorization for the sale of additional shares with an aggregate offering price of up to through May 2025.

Also, in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2023 , Spire executed forward sale agreements for shares and shares, respectively, of its common stock. On September 27, 2023, of these shares were settled, generating of net proceeds. The third quarter forward sales included a block sale of shares which must be settled on or before December 28, 2023. Had all shares under this forward agreement been settled as of September 30, 2023 , it would have generated net proceeds of .

 Spire Alabama occasionally utilizes a gasoline derivative program to stabilize the cost of fuel used in operations. As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 , there were no gasoline derivatives outstanding. 

million MMBtu of non-exchange-traded natural gas commodity contracts were reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Of these contracts, million MMBtu will settle during fiscal 2024 , and million MMBtu, million MMBtu, and million MMBtu, will settle during fiscal years 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively. A total of million MMBtu will settle in the years 2028 - 2030. These contracts have not been designated as hedges; therefore, changes in the fair value of these contracts are reported in earnings each period. 

Furthermore, Spire Marketing manages the price risk associated with its fixed-priced commitments by either closely matching the offsetting physical purchase or sale of natural gas at fixed prices or through the use of NYMEX or ICE futures, swap, and option contracts to lock in margins. 
 
 At September 30, 2023 , Spire Marketing s unmatched fixed-price positions were not material to Spire s financial position or results of operations. Spire Marketing s NYMEX and ICE natural gas futures, swap and option contracts used to lock in margins may be designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions for financial reporting purposes. 
 
 Spire enters into cash flow hedges through the execution of interest rate swap contracts to protect itself against adverse movements in interest rates. At September 30, 2023, the following swaps were outstanding: 

Quarter 2, fiscal 2022

As of September 30, 2023 , the Company has recorded through other comprehensive income a cumulative mark-to-market net asset of on open swaps. 
 
 The Company s and Spire Missouri s exchange-traded/cleared derivative instruments consist primarily of NYMEX and ICE positions. The NYMEX is the primary national commodities exchange on which natural gas derivatives are traded. Open NYMEX and ICE natural gas futures and swap positions at September 30, 2023 and 2022 were as follows: 

Natural gas options purchased, net 
 Natural gas basis swaps purchased

At September 30, 2023 , Spire Missouri also had million MMBtu of other price mitigation in place through the use of NYMEX natural gas option-based strategies. 

Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions are recognized on the balance sheets of the Company at fair value, and the change in fair value of the effective portion of these hedge instruments is recorded, net of income tax, in other comprehensive income or loss (OCI). Accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (AOCI) is a component of Total Common Stock Equity. Amounts are reclassified from AOCI into earnings when the hedged items affect net income, using the same revenue or expense category that the hedged item impacts. Based on market prices at September 30, 2023 , it is expected that of net gains will be reclassified into the Consolidated Statements of Income of the Company during the next twelve months. Cash flows from hedging transactions are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the items that are being hedged in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

 Spire Missouri 
 
 Spire Missouri has a risk management policy to utilize various derivatives, including futures contracts, exchange-traded options, swaps and over-the-counter instruments for the explicit purpose of managing price risk associated with purchasing and delivering natural gas on a regular basis to customers in accordance with its tariffs. The objective of this policy is to limit Spire Missouri s exposure to natural gas price volatility and to manage, hedge and mitigate substantial price risk. This policy strictly prohibits speculation and permits Spire Missouri to hedge current physical natural gas purchase commitments or forecasted or anticipated future peak (maximum) physical need for natural gas delivered. Costs and cost reductions, including carrying costs, associated with Spire Missouri s use of natural gas derivative instruments are allowed to be passed on to Spire Missouri customers through the operation of its PGA clause, through which the MoPSC allows Spire Missouri to recover gas supply costs, subject to prudence review by the MoPSC. Accordingly, Spire Missouri does not expect any adverse earnings impact as a result of the use of these derivative instruments. 
 
 Spire Missouri does not designate these instruments as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes because gains or losses associated with the use of these derivative instruments are deferred and recorded as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities pursuant to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations , and, as a result, have no direct impact on the statements of income. 
 
 The timing of the operation of the PGA clause may cause interim variations in short-term cash flows, because Spire Missouri is subject to cash margin requirements associated with changes in the values of these instruments. Nevertheless, carrying costs associated with such requirements are recovered through the PGA clause. 

From time to time, Spire Missouri purchases NYMEX futures and options contracts to help stabilize operating costs associated with forecasted purchases of gasoline and diesel fuels used to power vehicles and equipment used in the course of its business. The gains and losses on these contracts are not subject to Spire Missouri s PGA clause. At September 30, 2023 , Spire Missouri did not have a material amount of gasoline futures contracts outstanding. 
 
 Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions are recognized on the balance sheets at fair value and the change in the fair value of the effective portion of these hedge instruments is recorded, net of income tax, in OCI. AOCI is a component of Total Common Stock Equity. Amounts are reclassified from AOCI into earnings when the hedged items affect net income, using the same revenue or expense category that the hedged item impacts. As in both 2022 and 2021 , there will be no reclassifications into the statements of income during fiscal 2024 . Cash flows from hedging transactions are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the items that are being hedged in the statements of cash flows.

 Spire Alabama 
 
 Spire Alabama periodically employs a gasoline derivative program to help stabilize operating costs associated with forecasted purchases of gasoline and diesel fuels used to power vehicles and equipment used in the course of its business. The gains or losses on these derivative instruments are not subject to Spire Alabama s GSA rider. There were no such contracts outstanding as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 . 

million customers in three states across multiple rate classes resulting in a significant amount of revenue diversity. Credit risk is mitigated by the high percentage of residential customers as well as the geographic diversity of the Utilities, though customers for each of the Utilities are concentrated in a single state. 
 
 Spire Marketing s accounts receivable attributable to utility companies and their marketing affiliates totaled at September 30, 2023 . The concentration of transactions with these counterparties has the potential to affect the Company s overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that customers in this group may be affected similarly by changes in economic, industry, or other conditions. Spire Marketing also has concentrations of credit risk with certain individually significant counterparties. At September 30, 2023 , the amounts included in accounts receivable from its five largest counterparties (in terms of net accounts receivable exposure) totaled . Three of these five counterparties are investment-grade-rated integrated utilities, one is a liquefied natural gas project facility with a senior debt issue rating one notch below investment-grade with a positive outlook, and one is a utility marketing affiliate which is not rated but whose owners are all investment-grade public power companies. 
 
 To manage these risks, Spire Marketing has established procedures to determine the creditworthiness of its counterparties. These procedures include obtaining credit ratings and credit reports, analyzing counterparty financial statements to assess financial condition, and considering the industry environment in which the counterparty operates. This information is monitored on an ongoing basis. In some instances, Spire Marketing may require credit assurances such as prepayments, letters of credit, or parental guaranties. In addition, Spire Marketing may enter into netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk with counterparties in the energy industry with whom it conducts both sales and purchases of natural gas. Where there is no netting arrangement, Spire Marketing records accounts receivable, accounts payable, and prepayments for physical sales and purchases of natural gas on a gross basis. Sales are typically made on an unsecured credit basis with payment due the month following delivery. Accounts receivable amounts are closely monitored and provisions for uncollectible amounts are accrued when losses are probable.

As indicated in Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the Company s regulated operations accounting for income taxes is impacted by ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations . The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) reduced the corporate federal income tax rate, and the corresponding reductions in deferred income tax balances resulted in amounts previously collected from utility customers for these deferred taxes becoming refundable to such customers, generally through reductions in future rates. The TCJA includes provisions that stipulate how these excess deferred taxes are to be passed back to customers for certain accelerated tax depreciation benefits. In fiscal 2018, the MoPSC Amended Report and Order took effect and the estimated excess accumulated deferred income tax began to be returned to Spire Missouri customers in rates. During the prior fiscal year, the amount of excess accumulated deferred income taxes was trued up as part of the rate proceeding. The amount being returned related to the TCJA has been updated and in addition the excess accumulated deferred income taxes related to the Missouri tax rate change began to be returned in fiscal 2022. For Spire Missouri, excess accumulated deferred taxes of , , and , respectively, were returned in fiscal year 2023 , 2022 , and 2021 . The treatment for accumulated deferred income tax balances for Spire Alabama, Spire Gulf and Spire Mississippi started to be accounted for during fiscal 2023. For Spire Gulf, was returned to ratepayers. Spire Mississippi returned less than . For Spire Alabama, the deferred tax position resulted in a collection from customers of for fiscal 2023. 
 
 On April 14, 2023, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2023 - 15 that provides a safe harbor method of accounting that taxpayers may use to determine whether to deduct or capitalize expenditures to repair, maintain, replace, or improve natural gas transmission and distribution property. Under the revenue procedure, the method of accounting will depend on the property s classification as linear transmission property, linear distribution property, or non-linear property. The revenue procedure may be adopted in tax years ending after May 1, 2023. The Company is evaluating the revenue procedure and the impact adopting the safe harbor would have on its property that is subject to this guidance. 
 
 In assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management considers all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years, the timing of deferred tax liability reversals, projected future taxable income, taxable income in carryback years, and tax planning strategies to assess the need for a valuation allowance. Based upon this evidence, management believes it is more likely than not the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets. 

As of September 30, 2023 , Spire, and on a separate company basis, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, had federal and state loss carryforwards, contribution carryforwards, and various tax credit carryforwards as shown below. 

Contribution carryforwards 
 Tax credit carryforwards 

For federal tax purposes, Spire Missouri s and Spire Alabama s loss carryforwards may be utilized against income from another member of the consolidated group. The loss carryforwards begin to expire in fiscal 2030 for certain state purposes and fiscal 2035 for federal and other state purposes. Contribution carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards are expected to be utilized prior to their expiration. 
 
 The Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama recognize the tax benefit from a tax position only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Unrecognized tax benefits are reported as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for an operating loss carryforward to the extent the recognition of the benefit would impact the operating loss carryforward, pursuant to ASU 2013 - 11. The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of unrecognized tax benefits: 

Increases related to tax positions taken in current year 
 Reductions due to lapse of applicable statute of limitations 
 Unrecognized tax benefits, end of year 

As of September 30, 2023 and 2022 , the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate were and , respectively, for the Company, and , respectively, for Spire Missouri, and and , respectively, for Spire Alabama. It is reasonably possible that events will occur in the next 12 months that could increase or decrease the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits. The Company, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama do not expect that any such change will be significant to the balance sheets. Spire Alabama reported unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 . 
 
 The Company, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama record potential interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as interest expense and other income deductions, respectively. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022 , interest accrued associated with uncertain tax positions was de minimis, and penalties were accrued. 
 
 The Company, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama are no longer subject to examination for fiscal years prior to 2020, except to the extent the net operating losses from prior years are reviewed. 

The net periodic pension cost includes components shown in the following table. The components other than the service costs and regulatory adjustment are presented in Other Income, Net in the income statement, except for Spire Alabama s losses on lump-sum settlements. Such losses are capitalized in regulatory balances and amortized over the remaining actuarial life of individuals in the plan, and that amortization is presented in Other Income, Net.

Spire pension obligations are driven by separate plan and regulatory provisions governing Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and Spire EnergySouth pension plans. 
 
 Pursuant to the provisions of Spire Missouri s and Spire Alabama s pension plans, pension obligations may be satisfied by monthly annuities, lump-sum cash payments, or special termination benefits. Lump-sum payments are recognized as settlements (which can result in gains or losses) only if the total of such payments exceeds the sum of service and interest costs in a specific year. Special termination benefits, when offered, are also recognized as settlements which can result in gains or losses. 
 
 In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 , one Spire Missouri plan and two Spire Alabama plans met the criteria for settlement recognition, requiring re-measurement of the obligation under those plans using updated census data and assumptions for discount rate and mortality. For the remeasurements, the discount rate for the Missouri plan was updated to at September 30, 2023 (from at September 30, 2022 ), and the discount rate for the Alabama plans were updated to and , respectively, (from and , respectively). Lump-sum payments recognized as settlements during fiscal 2023 was attributable to Spire Missouri and to Spire Alabama). The Alabama regulatory tariff requires that settlement losses be amortized over the remaining actuarial life of the individuals in the plan, and in fiscal 2023 the amortization periods range from years to years. Therefore, lump sum settlement expenses were recorded in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 . 

In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, two Spire Missouri plans and two Spire Alabama plans met the criteria for settlement recognition, requiring re-measurement of the obligation under those plans using updated census data and assumptions for discount rate and mortality. For the remeasurements, the discount rates for the Missouri plans were updated to and , respectively, for each plan at September 30, 2022 from , at September 30, 2021), and the discount rate for the Alabama plans were updated to and , respectively, (from and , respectively). Lump-sum payments recognized as settlements during fiscal 2022 was attributable to Spire Missouri and to Spire Alabama). The Alabama regulatory tariff requires that settlement losses be amortized over the remaining actuarial life of the individuals in the plan, and in fiscal 2022 the amortization periods range from years to 12.3 years. Therefore, lump sum settlement expenses were recorded in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. 
 
 Effective December 23, 2021, the pension cost for Spire Missouri s western territory (Missouri West) included in customer rates was reduced from to per year, the pension cost included in Spire Missouri s eastern territory (Missouri East) customer rates was increased from to per year. Subsequently, on December 26, 2022, the amount in Missouri East was lowered to . The difference between these amounts and pension expense as calculated pursuant to the above and that otherwise would be included in the statements of income and statements of comprehensive income is deferred as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. 
 
 Also effective December 23, 2021, Missouri East prepaid pension assets and other postretirement benefits that were previously being included in rates at per year for eight years were reduced to per year, with the amortization period being reset for another eight years. Missouri West net liability for pension and other postretirement benefits that were previously reducing rates by per year for eight years were reduced to a reduction in rates per year, with the amortization period being reset for another eight years. Subsequently, on December 26, 2022, Missouri East amortization was lowered to and Missouri West to a reduction of .

In 2023, qualified plans except Spire Alabama's experienced actuarial gains. These gains were driven by the discount rates increasing by between and basis points, and were only partly offset by actuarial asset losses, as the trusts experienced actual returns below the actuarial expected returns. However, Spire Alabama had actuarial losses relating to larger than projected settlements, which, when combined with the actuarial asset losses, more than offset the gains relating to the increase in the discount rate.

The Spire Inc. Retirement Plans Committee is responsible for the administration of the various plans, and all payments under the plans require direction of that committee. The Spire Inc. Defined Benefit Plan Investment Review Committee utilizes an Outsourced Chief Investment Officer (OCIO) model where investment decisions are outsourced to investment consultants (Willis Towers Watson), who in turn become co-fiduciaries with the committee. 
 
 For all plans, the Company employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets with a prudent level of risk. Risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, corporate financial condition and market conditions. The Company has developed an investment strategy that focuses on asset allocation, diversification and quality guidelines. The investment goals are to obtain an adequate level of return to meet future obligations of the plan by providing above average risk-adjusted returns with a risk exposure in the mid-range of comparable funds. Comparative market and peer group benchmarks are utilized to ensure that investment managers are performing satisfactorily. The Company seeks to maintain an appropriate level of diversification to minimize the risk of large losses in a single asset class. Accordingly, plan assets for the pension plans do not have a concentration of assets in a single entity, industry, country, commodity or class of investment fund. 

The following table sets forth expected pension benefit payments for the succeeding five fiscal years, and in aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter, for Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama: 

Spire Missouri 
 Spire Alabama 

The funding policy of Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama is to contribute an amount not less than the minimum required by government funding standards nor more than the maximum deductible amount for federal income tax purposes. Spire Missouri s contributions to the pension plans in fiscal 2024 are anticipated to be into the qualified trusts, and into the non-qualified plans. Spire Alabama s contributions to the pension plans in fiscal 2024 are anticipated to be into the qualified trusts. 
 
 Other Postretirement Benefits 
 
 Spire and the Utilities provide certain life insurance benefits at retirement. Spire Missouri plans provide for medical insurance after early retirement until age 65. For retirements prior to January 1, 2015, the Missouri West plans provided medical insurance after retirement until death. The Spire Alabama plans provide medical insurance upon retirement until death for certain retirees depending on the type of employee and the date the employee was originally hired. 
 
 Net periodic postretirement benefit costs consist of the following components: 

Interest cost on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 
 Expected return on plan assets 
 Amortization of prior service cost (credit) 
 Amortization of actuarial gain 
 Subtotal 
 Regulatory adjustment 
 Net postretirement benefit (income) cost

 Amortization of actuarial gain 
 Current year prior service cost 
 Amortization of prior service (cost) credit 
 Subtotal 
 Regulatory adjustment 
 Total recognized in OCI 

Pursuant to a MoPSC Order, the return on plan assets is based on the market-related value of plan assets implemented prospectively over a four -year period. Gains and losses not yet includible in postretirement benefit cost are amortized only to the extent that such gain or loss exceeds of the greater of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. Such excess is amortized over the average remaining service life of active participants. Effective December 23, 2021, the allowance for recovery in rates for Spire Missouri s postretirement benefit plans was discontinued. The difference between no recovery in rates and postretirement expense as calculated pursuant to the above and that otherwise would be included in the statements of income and statements of comprehensive income is deferred as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. Effective with the resolution of the 2022 Missouri rate case in December 2022, net liabilities for postretirement benefits reduced rates and per year for Missouri East and Missouri West, respectively.

In fiscal 2023 , the actuarial gains for all qualified Spire plans were driven by the increase in the discount rate used to calculate the benefit obligation, combined with actuarial asset gains resulting from actual trust returns exceeding the expected returns. For Spire Alabama, these gains were more than offset by the loss associated with the difference between actual and assumed enrollment in Health Retirement Accounts.

Missouri and Alabama state laws provide for the recovery in rates of costs accrued pursuant to GAAP provided that such costs are funded through an independent, external funding mechanism. The Utilities have established Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association and Rabbi Trusts as external funding mechanisms. Their investment policies seek to maximize investment returns consistent with their tolerance for risk. Outside investment management specialists are utilized in each asset class. Such specialists are provided with guidelines, where appropriate, designed to ensure that the investment portfolio is managed in accordance with policy. Performance and compliance with the guidelines is regularly monitored. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama currently invest in mutual funds which are rebalanced periodically to the target allocation. The mutual funds are diversified across U.S. stock and bond markets, and for Spire Alabama, international stock markets. 

The following table sets forth expected postretirement benefit payments for the succeeding five fiscal years, and in aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter for Spire, Spire Missouri, and Spire Alabama: 

Spire Missouri 52.2 
 Spire Alabama 15.0 

The Utilities funding policy is to contribute amounts to the trusts equal to the periodic benefit cost calculated pursuant to GAAP as recovered in rates. For both Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama there are anticipated contributions to the postretirement plans in fiscal 2024 . 
 
 Other Plans

 Other 
 Total Regulatory Assets Not Earning a Return 

Like all the Company s regulatory assets, these regulatory assets as of September 30, 2023 are expected to be recovered from customers in future rates. The recovery period for the future income taxes due from customers and pension and other postretirement benefit costs could be years or longer, based on current Internal Revenue Service guidelines and average remaining service life of active participants, respectively. The recovery period for the PGA assets is less than two years. The other items not earning a return are expected to be recovered over a period not to exceed years, consistent with precedent set by the MoPSC, except for certain debt costs expected to be recovered over the related debt term, up to 35 years. Spire Alabama does not have any regulatory assets that are not earning a return. 

Spire Missouri 
 
 As authorized by the MoPSC, the PGA clause allows Spire Missouri to flow through to customers, subject to prudence review by the MoPSC, the cost of purchased gas supplies. To better match customer billings with market natural gas prices, Spire Missouri is allowed to file to modify, on a periodic basis, the level of gas costs in its PGA. Certain provisions of the PGA clause are included below: 
 Spire Missouri has a risk management policy that allows for the purchase of natural gas derivative instruments with the goal of managing price risk associated with purchasing natural gas on behalf of its customers. The MoPSC clarified that costs, cost reductions, and carrying costs associated with the Utility s use of natural gas derivative instruments are gas costs recoverable through the PGA mechanism. 
 The tariffs allow Spire Missouri flexibility to make up to three discretionary PGA changes during each year, in addition to its mandatory November PGA change, so long as such changes are separated by at least two months. 
 Spire Missouri is authorized to apply carrying costs to all over- or under-recoveries of gas costs, including cost increases and cost reductions associated with the use of derivative instruments, including cash payments for margin deposits. 
 Pre-tax income from off-system sales and capacity release revenues is shared with customers (such that customers receive and Spire Missouri receives ). 

Pursuant to the provisions of the PGA clause, the difference between actual costs incurred and costs recovered through the application of the PGA clause, as well as the actual amount of off-system sales and capacity release revenues allocated to customers, are reflected as a regulatory asset or liability at the end of the fiscal year. At that time, the balance is classified as a current asset or current liability and recovered from, or credited to, customers over an annual period commencing in the subsequent November. The balance in the current account is amortized as amounts are reflected in customer billings. In fiscal 2023, Spire Missouri filed two changes to its tariff, which were approved and became effective November 29, 2022 and January 19, 2023. 
 
 In mid- February 2021, the central U.S. experienced a period of unusually severe cold weather Winter Storm Uri ), and Spire Missouri implemented an Operational Flow Order (OFO) to preserve the integrity of its distribution system. During this time, Spire Missouri was required to purchase additional natural gas supply, both to ensure adequate supply for its firm utility customers, and to cover the shortfall created when third -party marketers failed to deliver natural gas supply to its city gates on behalf of their customers. In accordance with its MoPSC-approved OFO tariff, Spire Missouri invoiced the cost of gas and associated penalties totaling to non-compliant marketers and recorded accounts receivable. Recoveries collected are an offset to cost of natural gas for firm utility customers through the PGA and Actual Cost Adjustment (ACA), so are net income neutral to Spire Missouri. The three largest counterparties did not remit payment when due, so Spire Missouri filed suit against them in federal court to recover the invoiced amounts. In late February 2022, the parties to the OFO waiver suits agreed to a settlement in principle, pursuant to which marketers will reimburse Spire Missouri for the actual cost of its incremental gas purchases to serve marketers customers during Winter Storm Uri, so Spire Missouri reduced revenue, accounts receivable, cost of gas and regulatory liabilities by approximately in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The settlement, which reduced the total amount due from the three marketers to approximately , was approved by the MoPSC in late May 2022, and the marketers are making timely payments to Spire Missouri. 
 
 As a result of the significant net deferred gas costs and average inventory cost in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to Winter Storm Uri, Spire Missouri filed for and received MoPSC approval for an adjustment to the PGA tariff to increase a Filing Adjustment Factor (FAF) credit on customers' bills for three years. This lowered the net PGA rate to mitigate the impact of Winter Storm Uri costs on customers. All gas costs will eventually be recovered by Spire Missouri through the PGA or ACA mechanisms and carrying costs will be applied per the terms of the tariff. 
 
 In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the MoPSC approved Spire Missouri compliance tariffs with an effective date of December 23, 2021, consistent with its order in Spire Missouri s general rate case. These new tariffs were designed to increase Spire Missouri s aggregate annual gross base rate revenues by , which includes incremental and already being collected through the Infrastructure System Replacement Surcharge (ISRS). The MoPSC required Spire Missouri to defer all non-operational overheads from December 23, 2021 through September 30, 2022 into a regulatory asset totaling . On April 1, 2022, Spire Missouri filed tariff sheets to initiate a new general rate case proceeding intended to address the deferred amounts, along with other matters. The parties reached a Full Unanimous Stipulation and Agreement (the Stipulation to resolve all issues in the case, which was filed with the MoPSC on November 4, 2022. On November 18, 2022, the Stipulation was approved, including authorization of in new base rate revenue (including already being collected through ISRS) and recovery of deferred overheads through amortization of the related regulatory asset. New base rates became effective on December 26, 2022. 

ISRS allows Spire Missouri expedited recovery for its investment to replace qualifying components of its infrastructure without the necessity of a formal rate case. As noted above, all prior ISRS revenues were reset to zero as of December 26, 2022 as a result of Spire Missouri's most recent base rate case. On April 20, 2023, the MoPSC approved an incremental annual ISRS revenue increase of , effective May 6, 2023, reflecting eligible pipe replacement from October 2022 through February 2023. On October 4, 2023, the MoPSC approved an incremental annual ISRS revenue increase of , effective October 23, 2023, reflecting eligible pipe replacement from March 2023 through August 2023. 
 
 On May 27, 2022, the MoPSC staff filed an ACA Review Recommendation and Report for the ACA period that first includes transportation charges incurred by Spire Missouri for service on the Spire STL Pipeline. That report concluded that the transaction complied with Missouri affiliate transaction rules and was prudent, and it recommended no disallowance of any Spire STL Pipeline related costs from the ACA mechanism. On July 11, 2022, Spire Missouri filed its response comments in support of the recommendation. The Missouri Office of the Public Counsel and Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) filed comments on July 29 and August 1, 2022, respectively, raising concerns about the Spire STL Pipeline transaction, the ACA process itself, and other matters. On January 6, 2023, Spire Missouri filed a Partial Stipulation and Agreement resolving all other issues raised by the MoPSC staff in its Recommendation and Report. The partial stipulation was approved by the MoPSC on January 25, 2023, resulting in a credit to the ACA balance, but issues relating to Spire STL Pipeline costs remained contested. An evidentiary hearing on this matter was scheduled to be held July 25- 26, 2023; however, on July 21, 2023, MoPSC suspended the procedural schedule in recognition that the parties had reached an agreement in principle to resolve the matter via settlement stipulation. The stipulation and agreement was approved by the Commission on August 23, 2023 and included an increase in customer assistance program funding among other non-monetary commitments. 
 
 In 2022, the MoPSC initiated their annual ACA dockets (GR- 2022 - 0135 and GR- 2022 - 0136 to audit gas commodity and transportation costs for the 2020 - 2021 heating season, which included the impact of Winter Storm Uri on Spire Missouri's natural gas portfolio. On December 15, 2022, the MoPSC staff filed its Reports and Recommendations in these cases proposing various disallowances relating to imbalance cash-outs and an off-system sale. On January 19, 2023, Spire Missouri filed its response to this proposal setting forth its position that there is no basis in law or fact for either disallowance. On July 12, 2023, the MoPSC entered a scheduling order in this matter which includes several rounds of pre-filed testimony prior to an evidentiary hearing to be held in early May 2024. On November 2, 2023, Spire Missouri filed an unopposed settlement stipulation by which the MoPSC Staff agreed to withdraw its recommendation of a proposed disallowance relating to imbalance cash-outs. The proposed disallowance relating to an off-system sale remains pending in the case. Management believes the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is remote. 
 
 Spire Alabama 
 
 In September 2022, the APSC approved the renewal of RSE through September 30, 2025, with certain modifications to the previous terms. Under RSE, the APSC conducts reviews in March, June and September to determine whether Spire Alabama s return on average common equity (ROE) at the end of the rate year will be within the allowed range of return. Reductions in rates can be made quarterly to bring the projected ROE within the allowed range; increases, however, are allowed only once each rate year, effective December 1, and cannot exceed of prior-year revenues. Effective October 1, 2022, Spire Alabama's allowed range of ROE is to with an adjusting point of . Previously, the allowed range was to with an adjusting point of . Spire Alabama is subject to a performance-based adjustment of plus or minus basis points to the ROE adjusting point, based upon the terms of the previously approved Accelerated Infrastructure Modernization (AIM) Program tariff; however, Spire applied for and received approval to suspend the operation of the AIM performance-based adjustment for 2022, 2023, and 2024, impacting fiscal years 2023 through 2025. Spire Alabama s equity as a percent of total capitalization is limited to , and Average Common Equity growth is limited to each year. 

The inflation-based Cost Control Measure (CCM) established by the APSC allows for annual changes in operation and maintenance O M expense relative to an index range. Effective October 1, 2022, the Base Year O M expense was computed by averaging the actual O M expenses for 2020, 2021, and 2022. The Base CPI-U was computed by averaging the August CPI-U for 2020, 2021, 2022. The Index is computed by measuring the change from the Base CPI-U to the August CPI-U of the most recently completed fiscal year, less a factor of . The index range will be computed by adjusting the Index plus or minus . If rate year O M expense falls within the index range, no adjustment is required. If rate year O M expense exceeds the index range, three -quarters of the difference is returned to customers through future rate adjustments. To the extent rate year O M is less than the index range, Spire Alabama benefits by one -half of the difference through future rate adjustments. If a benefit is achieved, the Base Year and the Base CPI-U for the following year will each be reset to an average of the three preceding completed years. If a benefit is not achieved, the Base Year and Base CPI-U will not be updated. Certain items that fluctuate based on situations demonstrated to be beyond Spire Alabama s control may be excluded from the CCM calculation. 
 
 The RSE reduction for September 30, 2021 following the year-end point of test was to bring the expected rate of return on average common equity to within the allowed rate of return. The CCM benefit for rate year 2021 was . To mitigate the impact on ratepayers, Spire Alabama requested and received approval from the APSC to recover the 2021 CCM benefit over five years (with recognition of revenue only up to 24 months in advance of recovery). As a part of the annual update for RSE, on December 29, 2021, Spire Alabama filed an increase for rate year 2022 of . The 2021 RSE reduction of , the five -year recovery of the 2021 CCM benefit of and the annual RSE increase of were all effective on January 1, 2022. There was no RSE reduction in 2022 for the January 31, April 30, July 31 or September 30 quarterly points of test. Spire Alabama recorded a CCM benefit for rate year 2022 of . Similar to the rate year 2021 CCM benefit, Spire requested and received approval to recover the rate year 2022 CCM benefit over five years. On October 26, 2022, Spire Alabama made its annual RSE rate filing with the APSC, presenting the utility s budget for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, including net income and a calculation of allowed ROE. The budget reflected the start of amortization of the accumulated deferred income tax (ADIT) adjustment related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA). New rates designed to provide an annual revenue increase of became effective January 1, 2023. There was no RSE reduction in 2023 for the March 31, June 30 or September 30 points of test. Spire Alabama recorded a CCM benefit for rate year 2023 of . On October 26, 2023, Spire Alabama made its annual RSE rate filing, presenting the utility s budget for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, including net income and a calculation of allowed ROE. New rates designed to provide an annual revenue increase of are anticipated to become effective December 1, 2023. 
 
 Spire Alabama s rate schedules for natural gas distribution charges contain a GSA rider which permits the pass-through to customers of changes in the cost of gas supply. Spire Alabama s tariff provides a temperature adjustment mechanism, also included in the GSA rider, which is designed to moderate the impact of departures from normal temperatures on Spire Alabama s earnings. The temperature adjustment applies primarily to residential, small commercial and small industrial customers. Other non-temperature weather-related conditions that may affect customer usage are not included in the temperature adjustment. There is also a mechanism under Spire Alabama's GSA rider allowing the utility to create value through off-system sales of excess natural gas supply and capacity and to give of the value created to customers while retaining . As of April 2022, the first of value from capacity release goes entirely to customers before Spire Alabama retains . In the past year, Spire Alabama filed GSA rate increases effective December 1, 2022 and January 1, 2023, and GSA rate decreases effective October 1, 2023 and anticipated to become effective December 1, 2023, primarily attributable to changes in natural gas prices. 
 
 The APSC approved an Enhanced Stability Reserve (ESR) in 1998, which was subsequently modified and expanded in 2010. As currently approved, the ESR provides deferred treatment and recovery for the following: 1 extraordinary O M expenses related to environmental response costs; 2 extraordinary O M expenses related to self-insurance costs that exceed per occurrence; 3 extraordinary O M expenses, other than environmental response costs and self-insurance costs, resulting from a single force majeure event or multiple force majeure events greater than and , respectively, during a rate year; and 4 negative individual large commercial and industrial customer budget revenue variances that exceed during a rate year. Charges to the ESR are subject to certain limitations which may disallow deferred treatment and which prescribe the timing of recovery. Subject to APSC authorization, Spire Alabama expects to be able to recover underfunded ESR balances over a five -year amortization period with an annual limitation of . Amounts in excess of this limitation are deferred for recovery in future years. 

Spire 
 
 In addition to those discussed above for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, Spire is affected by the following regulatory matters. 
 
 Spire Gulf has similar rate regulation to Spire Alabama. Its RSE rate-setting mechanism was renewed in September 2021 for a four -year term through September 2025. The RSE allowed ROE range was to with an adjusting point of in fiscal 2021, while the ROE range is to with an adjusting point of for fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2025. In October 2021 and 2022, Spire Gulf made its annual RSE rate filings with the APSC based on its budget for the new fiscal year and an allowed ROE of , and new rates designed to provide increased annual revenues of and became effective at the beginning of January 2022 and 2023, respectively. The fiscal 2023 budget reflected the start of amortization of the excess ADIT from the TCJA. Spire Gulf filed its RSE point of test as of April 30, 2023 with the APSC reflecting that its projected ROE exceeded the allowed ROE resulting in an annualized refund of that became effective July 1, 2023. Spire Gulf filed its RSE point of test as of September 30, 2023, reflecting that its actual ROE exceeded the allowed ROE resulting in an additional annualized refund of that are anticipated to become effective December 1, 2023. The CCM has similar evaluation and recovery provisions when expenses exceed or are under a band of plus or minus around the CPI-U inflated O M per customer expense level from the base year, excluding expenses for pensions and gas bad debt. The base year for the O M index was 2017 for fiscal 2021 and was 2021 for fiscal 2022. Since a CCM benefit was recorded in fiscal 2022, the base year O M index for fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2025 will be the 2022 O M level. Spire Gulf recorded a CCM benefit for rate year 2021 of to revenues, resulting in a net income benefit of . A CCM benefit of was recorded for fiscal 2022 to an economic development fund that can be used for economic development purposes subject to APSC approval. Spire Gulf s O M for fiscal 2023 was within the O M per customer inflation adjusted band. Spire Gulf has a Cast Iron Main Replacement Factor (CIF) that provides an enhanced return on the pro-rata costs associated with cast iron main replacement exceeding 10 miles per year based on a weighting for the equity content. Capital expenditures recovered under the CIF have not increased since fiscal 2019 pursuant to applicable tariff provisions although the Company is continuing to recover costs of service associated with accumulated expenditures under the CIF. Spire Gulf also has an ESR for negative revenue variances over or a force majeure event expense of (or two events that exceed and an Environmental Cost Recovery Factor that recovers of prudently incurred costs for compliance with environmental laws, rules and regulations. Spire Gulf has an APSC-approved intercompany revolving credit agreement with Spire to borrow in a principal amount not to exceed and to loan up to . 
 
 Spire Mississippi utilizes a formula rate-making process under the Rate Stabilization Adjustment Rider (RSA). An allowed return on equity (currently is computed annually and compared to the actual return on equity based on a rate year ending June 30. If the actual equity return on an end of period rate base is beyond the allowed return on equity by , then of any shortfall is recovered through a rate increase and of any excess results in a rate decrease. Updates may include known and measurable adjustments to historic costs from the 12 months ended June 30, submitted September 15 for an effective date of November 1, unless disputed by the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff (MPUS), with any disputes to be resolved by the Mississippi Public Service Commission (MSPSC) by January 15 of the following year. The MSPSC approved stipulation agreements between the MPUS and Spire Mississippi that provided for increased annual revenues of through rates effective on February 1, 2022 and an additional effective on January 1, 2023. Spire Mississippi s RSA filing made on September 1, 2023 reflected a rate increase of and is pending review by the MPUS. Additionally, a Supplemental Growth Rider provides recovery of certain Spire Mississippi system expansion projects to serve qualified economic development projects. 
 
 In August 2018, the FERC approved an order issuing Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity FERC Certificates for the Spire STL Pipeline August 2018 Order ). In June 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued an order vacating the FERC Certificates and remanding the matter back to the FERC for further action. In September and December 2021, the FERC issued temporary certificates for the continued authorized operation of the Spire STL Pipeline pending the outcome of its determination on remand. On December 15, 2022, the FERC issued its order on remand reissuing permanent FERC Certificates for the continued operation of the Spire STL Pipeline, and that order is final and no longer appealable. 

, and for the Company, Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, respectively. Additional contracts are generally entered into prior to or during the heating season of November through April. The Utilities recover their costs from customers in accordance with their PGA clauses or GSA riders. 
 
 In May 2023, Spire entered into an agreement to acquire MoGas Pipeline, an interstate natural gas pipeline, and Omega Pipeline, a connected gas distribution system, from CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc., for cash, subject to customary working capital and other closing adjustments. Spire has received a request for additional information ("Second Request") from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with regard to this proposed acquisition. The Company is cooperating fully with the FTC regarding the Second Request and expects to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 subject to receiving FTC approval. 
 
 A consolidated subsidiary of Spire is a limited partner in Inter-Atlantic Energy Capital Ventures, L.P., an unconsolidated partnership focusing on sustainability initiatives largely tied to the natural gas utility sector. Spire committed to contribute a total of of capital to the partnership as and when requested by the general partner. As of September 30, 2023 , the remaining unfunded commitment was . 

Contingencies 
 
 The Company and the Utilities account for contingencies, including environmental liabilities, in accordance with accounting standards under the loss contingency guidance of ASC Topic 450, Contingencies , when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. 
 
 In addition to matters noted below, the Company and the Utilities are involved in other litigation, claims, and investigations arising in the normal course of business. Management, after discussion with counsel, believes the final outcome will not have a material effect on the statements of income, balance sheets, and statements of cash flows of the Company, Spire Missouri, or Spire Alabama. However, there is uncertainty in the valuation of pending claims and prediction of litigation results. 
 
 The Company and the Utilities own and operate natural gas distribution, transmission, and storage facilities, the operations of which are subject to various environmental laws, regulations, and interpretations. While environmental issues resulting from such operations arise in the ordinary course of business, such issues have not materially affected the Company s or Utilities financial position and results of operations. As environmental laws, regulations, and their interpretations change, the Company or the Utilities may incur additional environmental liabilities that may result in additional costs, which may be material. 
 
 In the natural gas industry, many gas distribution companies have incurred environmental liabilities associated with sites they or their predecessor companies formerly owned or operated where manufactured gas operations took place. The Utilities each have former manufactured gas plant (MGP) operations in their respective service territories, some of which are discussed under the Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama headings below. To the extent costs are incurred associated with environmental remediation activities, the Utilities would request authority from their respective regulators to defer such costs (less any amounts received from insurance proceeds or as contributions from other potentially responsible parties (PRPs)) and collect them through future rates. 
 
 To date, costs incurred for all Spire MGP sites for investigation, remediation and monitoring have not been material. However, the amount of costs relative to future remedial actions at these and other sites is unknown and may be material. The actual future costs that Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama may incur could be materially higher or lower depending upon several factors, including whether remediation will be required, final selection and regulatory approval of any remedial actions, changing technologies and government regulations, the ultimate ability of other PRPs to pay, and any insurance recoveries. 
 
 In 2020, Spire retained an outside consultant to conduct probabilistic cost modeling of its former MGP sites in Missouri and Alabama. The purpose of this analysis was to develop an estimated range of probabilistic future liability for each of their MGP sites. That analysis, completed in March 2021, provided a range of demonstrated possible future expenditures to investigate, monitor and remediate the former MGP sites. Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama have recorded their best estimates of the probable expenditures that relate to these matters. The amount remains immaterial, and Spire Missouri, Spire Alabama and the Company do not expect potential liabilities that may arise from remediating these sites to have a material impact on their future financial condition or results of operations. 

Spire Missouri 
 
 Spire Missouri has identified three former MGP sites in the city of St. Louis, Missouri (the City where costs have been incurred and claims have been asserted. Spire Missouri has enrolled two of the sites in the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MoDNR) Brownfields/Voluntary Cleanup Program (BVCP). The third site is the result of an assertion by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
 
 In conjunction with redevelopment of the Carondelet Coke site, Spire Missouri and another former owner of the site entered into an agreement (the Remediation Agreement with the City development agencies, the developer, and an environmental consultant that obligates one of the City agencies and the environmental consultant to remediate the site and obtain a No Further Action (NFA) letter from the MoDNR. The Remediation Agreement also provides for a release of Spire Missouri and the other former site owner from certain liabilities related to the past and current environmental condition of the site and requires the developer and the environmental consultant to maintain certain insurance coverage, including remediation cost containment, premises pollution liability, and professional liability. The operative provisions of the Remediation Agreement were triggered on December 20, 2010, on which date Spire Missouri and the other former site owner, as full consideration under the Remediation Agreement, paid a small percentage of the cost of remediation of the site. The property was divided into seven parcels, and MoDNR NFA letters have been received for six of the parcels. Remediation is ongoing on the last parcel. 
 
 In a letter dated June 29, 2011, the Attorney General for the State of Missouri informed Spire Missouri that the MoDNR had completed an investigation of the second site, Station A. The Attorney General requested that Spire Missouri participate in the follow up investigations of the site. In a letter dated January 10, 2012, Spire Missouri stated that it would participate in future environmental response activities at the site in conjunction with other PRPs. Accordingly, Spire Missouri entered into a cost sharing agreement for remedial investigation with other PRPs. MoDNR never approved the agreement, so no remedial investigation took place. Recently, Spire Missouri was approached by a real estate developer interested in purchasing the northern half of the Station A site and developing the same for industrial purposes. Consequently, Spire Missouri is now in discussions with the developer, other PRPs and MoDNR to develop a new remedial investigation plan for the site. 
 
 Additionally, in correspondence dated November 30, 2016, Region 7 of the EPA has asserted that Spire Missouri is liable under Section 107 (a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) for alleged coal gas waste contamination at a third site, Station B. Spire Missouri and the site owner notified the EPA that information and data provided by the EPA to date does not rise to the level of documenting a threat to the public health or environment. As such, in March 2017 Spire Missouri requested more information from the EPA. Spire Missouri never received a response from the EPA. 
 
 Spire Missouri has notified its insurers that it seeks reimbursement for costs incurred in the past and future potential liabilities associated with these MGP sites. While some of the insurers have denied coverage and reserved their rights, Spire Missouri retains the right to seek potential reimbursements from them. 
 
 On March 10, 2015, Spire Missouri received a Section 104 (e) information request under CERCLA from EPA Region 7 regarding the former Thompson Chemical/Superior Solvents site in the City. In turn, Spire Missouri issued a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the EPA on April 3, 2015, to identify the basis of the inquiry. The FOIA response from the EPA was received on July 15, 2015, and a response was provided to the EPA on August 15, 2015. Spire Missouri has received no further inquiry from the EPA regarding this matter. 
 
 In its western service area, Spire Missouri has six owned MGP sites enrolled in the BVCP, including Joplin MGP #1, St. Joseph MGP #1, Kansas City Coal Gas Station B, Kansas City Station A Railroad area, Kansas City Coal Gas Station A, and Independence MGP #2. Source removal has been conducted at all the owned sites since 2003 with the exception of Joplin. On September 15, 2016, a request was made with the MoDNR for a restrictive covenant use limitation with respect to Joplin. Remediation efforts at the six sites are at various stages of completion, ranging from groundwater monitoring and sampling following source removal activities to the aforementioned request for the Joplin site. As part of its participation in the BVCP, Spire Missouri communicates regularly with the MoDNR with respect to its remediation efforts and monitoring activities at these sites. On May 11, 2015, MoDNR approved the next phase of investigation at the Kansas City Station A Railroad area. 

Spire Alabama 
 
 Spire Alabama is in the chain of title of nine former MGP sites, four of which it still owns, and five former manufactured gas distribution sites, one of which it still owns. All are located in the state of Alabama. 
 
 In 2011, a removal action was completed and an NFA letter was received at the Huntsville MGP site pursuant to an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent among the EPA, Spire Alabama and the current site owner. 
 
 In 2012, Spire Alabama responded to an EPA Request for Information Pursuant to Section 104 of CERCLA relating to the 35th Avenue Superfund Site located in North Birmingham, Jefferson County, Alabama. Spire Alabama was identified as a PRP under CERCLA for the cleanup of the site or costs the EPA incurs in cleaning up the site. At this point, Spire Alabama has not been provided information that would allow it to determine the extent, if any, of its potential liability with respect to the 35th Avenue Superfund Site and vigorously denies its inclusion as a PRP. 
 
 Assessments were performed by the EPA of the former MGP sites in Gadsden and Anniston, and NFA letters were received after each assessment. 
 
 Spire 
 
 In addition to those discussed above for Spire Missouri and Spire Alabama, Spire is aware of the following contingent matters. 
 
 Spire Marketing, along with many natural gas industry participants, faced the unprecedented effects of Winter Storm Uri in February 2021. Numerous natural gas producers and midstream operators were unable to deliver natural gas to market as they experienced wellhead freeze-offs, power outages and equipment failure due to the extreme weather. These events resulted in supply curtailments, and related notices of force majeure to excuse performance, from and to certain counterparties. Further, these events have made Spire Marketing subject to various commercial disputes (including regarding force majeure). As such, Spire Marketing has recorded an estimate of potential liabilities for damages based on communications with counterparties and the facts and circumstances surrounding each transaction. These estimates are adjusted as new facts emerge or settlement agreements are reached, and it is possible that final settlement amounts may materially differ from the current estimate. 

Cash flow and noncash information about operating leases: 
 Operating cash flows representing cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities 
 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities 

The following table shows year-end balance sheet and weighted-average information about operating leases. 

Lease liabilities, current 
 Lease liabilities, noncurrent 
 Weighted-average remaining lease term (in years) 
 Weighted-average discount rate 

On the balance sheets, right-of-use assets are included in Deferred Charges and Other Assets: Other, current lease liabilities are in Current Liabilities: Other, and noncurrent lease liabilities are in Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities: Other. 
 
 Following is a maturity analysis by fiscal year for operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2023 . 

2025 
 2026 
 2027 
 2028 
 Thereafter 
 Total undiscounted lease payments 
 Less present value discount 
 Total current and noncurrent lease liabilities 

There are no significant finance leases, short-term leases, subleases, variable lease payments, residual value guarantees, restrictions or covenants pertaining to leases. 
 
 The Company elected, for all asset classes, not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases. Instead, the lease payments for short-term leases are recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term and variable lease payments are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. The Company elected, for all asset classes, not to separate nonlease components from lease components and instead to account for each separate lease component and the nonlease components associated with that lease component as a single lease component. 
 
 The discount rate used for all the leases is the applicable incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. For a subsidiary lessee, the rate applicable to the subsidiary is used unless the lease terms are influenced by parent credit.

 Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting. Spire Inc. s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 Spire Inc. s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of Spire Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment, management concluded that Spire Inc. s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023. Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on Spire Inc. s internal control over financial reporting, which is included in Item 8 , Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Section 2. Administration 

This Policy shall be administered by the Board or, if so designated by the Board, the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board (the Committee ), in which case references herein to the Board shall be deemed references to the Committee. 

Subject to the provisions of this Policy, the Board shall make such determinations and interpretations and take such actions in connection with this Policy as it deems necessary or advisable. All determinations and interpretations made by the Board shall be final, binding and conclusive. 

Section 3. Definitions 

i. 

Accounting Restatement means a restatement of the Company s financial statements due to material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under applicable securities laws, including: (A) a restatement to correct a material error in a previously issued financial statement; or (B) a restatement to correct an immaterial error from a previously issued financial statement would result in a material misstatement in the current-period financial statement. 

ii. 

Covered Employee means any current and former Executive Officers, and such other senior executives who may from time to time be deemed subject to the Policy by the Board or Committee. 

iii. 

Excess Incentive Compensation means the amount of Incentive Compensation received by the Covered Employee that exceeds the amount of Incentive Compensation that would have otherwise been received by the Covered Employee had it been determined based on the results of the Accounting Restatement, computed without regard to any taxes paid. 

iv. 

Executive Officer shall have the meaning set forth in NYSE Rule 303A.14. 

v. 

Financial Reporting Measures are measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company s financial statements, whether presented in or outside of the Company s financial statements, any measure derived wholly or in part from such measures (including non-GAAP measures and other measures, metrics, and ratios that are non-GAAP measures). Stock price and total shareholder return are also financial reporting measures. 

vi. 

Incentive Compensation means any compensation including, but not limited to: (i) annual bonuses and other short-term and long-term cash incentives; (ii) stock options; (iii) stock appreciation rights; (iv) restricted stock; (v) restricted stock units; (vi) performance shares; and (vii) performance units, in each case, that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part on the attainment of any of the Financial Reporting Measures. 

vii. 

Recovery Period means the three (3) completed fiscal years immediately preceding the Required Accounting Restatement Date. In addition, the Recovery Period shall include any transition period (that results from a change in the Company s fiscal year) within or immediately following the aforementioned three (3) completed fiscal years; provided, however , that a transition period between the last day of the Company s previous fiscal year end and the first of its new fiscal year that comprises a period of nine (9) to twelve (12) months would be deemed a completed fiscal year. 

viii. 

Required Accounting Restatement Date means the earlier to occur of: (i) the date the Board, a committee of the Board, or the officers or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if the Board is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement or (ii) the date a court, regulatory, or other legally authorized body directs to the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement. 

Section 4. Persons Subject to this Policy 

This Policy shall apply to all Incentive Compensation received on or after October 2, 2023, by a Covered Employee: (i) after beginning service as an Executive Officer; (ii) who served as an Executive Officer during the Recovery Period; and (iii) while the Company has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities association. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may choose to apply this Policy, in its discretion, to Incentive Compensation received by a Covered Person during the Recovery Period even if such person did not serve as an Executive Officer during all or part of the Recovery Period. 

Section 5. Erroneously Awarded Incentive Compensation and Amount Subject to Clawback. 

In the event the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, the amount to be recovered from the Covered Employee shall be the Excess Incentive Compensation paid or awarded to a Covered Employee during the Recovery Period. For purposes of calculating the Excess Incentive Compensation amount, Incentive Compensation will be deemed received in the Company s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the incentive-based compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive Compensation occurs after the end of that period. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Board cannot determine the amount of Excess Incentive Compensation received by the Covered Employee directly from the information in the Accounting Restatement, the Board will make a determination as to the amount of Excess Incentive Compensation based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement. 

Any action by the Company to recover Excess Incentive Compensation under this Policy from a Covered Employee shall not, whether alone or in combination with any other action, event or condition, be deemed (i) good reason for resignation or to serve as a basis for a claim of constructive termination under any benefits or compensation arrangement applicable to such Covered Employee, or (ii) to constitute a breach of a contract or other arrangement to which such Covered Employee is party. 

Section 6. Method of Recoupment 

The Board shall determine, in its sole discretion, the method of recovering or cancelling, as the case may be, Excess Incentive Compensation, which may include, without limitation, any one or more of the following: 

i. 

requiring reimbursement of cash Excess Incentive Compensation previously paid; 

ii. 

seeking the recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or other disposition of any equity or equity-based awards; 

iii. 

offsetting the Excess Incentive Compensation from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the Covered Employee; 

iv. 

cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and/or 

v. 

taking any other remedial recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Board. 

Section 7. Impracticability 

The Board shall recover any Excess Incentive Compensation in accordance with this Policy unless the Board concludes such recovery would be impracticable, as determined by the Board pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act and NYSE Rule 303A.14. 

Section 8. Indemnification 

The Company shall not indemnify any Covered Employee, directly or indirectly, for any losses that such Covered Employee may incur in connection with the recovery of any compensation set forth in this Policy. 

Section 9. Other Recoupment Rights 

Any applicable employment agreement, award agreement or other document setting forth the terms and conditions of any compensation covered by this Policy shall be deemed to include the restrictions imposed herein and incorporate this Policy by reference and, in the event of any inconsistency, the terms of this Policy will govern. To the extent that any applicable law or stock market or exchange rules or regulations permit or require recovery of compensation in circumstances in addition to those specified herein, nothing in this Policy will be deemed to limit or restrict the right or obligation of the Company to recover such compensation to the fullest extent permitted or required by such law, rules or regulations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no duplication of recovery of the same Excess Incentive Compensation under this Policy and any such other clawback rights, unless required by applicable law. 

The Board shall provide notice and seek written acknowledgement of this Policy from each Covered Employee as soon as practicable after the later of (i) the Effective Date and (ii) the date on which the employee is designated as a Covered Officer provided, however, that failure to obtain such acknowledgement shall have no impact on the enforceability of this Policy. 

Section 10. Interpretation; Amendment; Termination 

The Board may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary to comply with the regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 10D of the Exchange Act and with NYSE Rule 303A.14, or any successor regulations or rules. The Board may terminate this Policy at any time. 

Section 11. Enforceability
