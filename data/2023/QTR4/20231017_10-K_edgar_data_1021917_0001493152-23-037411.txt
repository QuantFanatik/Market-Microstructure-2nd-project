PART
I 

Item
1. Business. 

The
Company 

Awaysis
Capital, Inc. (the Company , we , us or our is a real estate investment and management
company focused on acquisition, construction, selling and managing rentals of residential vacation home communities in desirable travel
destinations. We seek to create value through the targeting and acquisition, development, and up-cycling, rebranding, and repositioning
of currently undervalued operating and shovel ready residential/resort communities in global travel destinations, with the intention
to relaunch these assets under the Awaysis brand with the goals of creating a network of residential and resort enclave
communities that will optimize both sales and rental revenues, providing attractive returns to owners and exceptional vacation experiences
to travelers. At least initially, our target acquisitions are resorts that have not been completed nor have a prior operational history.
As such we intend to purchase the real estate and finish the development, then we would sell the finished units and put them in a rental
pool. 

The
Company seeks to own and grow a stable, cash generating, diversified portfolio of single-family and luxury resort/residence properties
in the Caribbean, Europe, South America, and the United States. 

Our
business strategy entails targeting and identifying undervalued assets in emerging markets located in proximity to high demand travel
destinations. The Company intends to focus these efforts on shovel-ready properties and/or other assets that we believe can be used to
optimize sales and rental revenues. We have currently identified five properties in Belize, all of which are expected to constitute our
initial real estate portfolio. To that effect, on June 30, 2022, we closed on the acquisition of certain real estate assets in San Pedro,
Belize (the Casamora Awaysis Assets ), pursuant to our previously announced series of Agreements of Purchase and Sale, all
dated April 15, 2022. The total consideration paid by us for the properties subject to the agreements was at the appraisal value of 11.4
million (excluding transaction costs and fees) and was settled in a combination of a Purchase Money Mortgage of 2.6 million at 0 interest
rate, payable on demand, a Purchase Money Mortgage of 280,000 at 0 interest rate that was paid on August 8, 2022 and 56.8 million shares
of the Company s common stock based on a per share price equal to the market price on the date of appraisal of 0.150. As the first
acquisition by the Company in Belize and an important milestone, the Company expects to rebrand the Casamora Awaysis Asset, so it is
easily identifiable as an Awaysis Property and fit perfectly with its strategy of creating a countrywide network of Awaysis residential
enclave communities in the country. 

2 

The
Casamora Awaysis Assets are as follows:

History 

The
Company was formed in Delaware on September 29, 2008, under the name ASPI, Inc ASPI ). 

On
April 25, 2012, ASPI filed an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation to change its name from ASPI, Inc. to JV Group, Inc. and
to increase the number of its authorized common shares from One Hundred Million (100,000,000) shares to One Billion (1,000,000,000) shares. 

From
its formation on September 28, 2008, through September 7, 2011, the Company was a publicly quoted shell company seeking to merge with
an entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of common stock to create value for the Company s
shareholders. 

From
September 8, 2011, through October 2015, through the Company s wholly owned subsidiary, Prestige Prime Office, Limited Prestige ),
a Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Corporation, the Company operated as a serviced office provider in the Far East. Prestige ceased
serviced office provider operations in October 2015, and effective September 30, 2017, the Company disposed of Prestige and its assets
and liabilities.

As
of November 23, 2021, Michael A. Littman ATTY, Defined Benefit Plan, MAL as trustee, an affiliate of Michael A. Littman, the then secretary
and a director of the Company and the owner of 98,108,000 shares of the Company s common stock representing approximately 99.2 
of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock, sold 98,008,000 shares to Harthorne Capital Inc., a Delaware corporation Harthorne ), for aggregate consideration of 500,000, or approximately 0.0051 per share. This transaction was deemed a
change of control, and effective as of November 23, 2021, (a) Calvin D. Smiley, Sr., the Company s Chief Executive Officer and
President, resigned from all officer and employment positions with the Company and its subsidiaries, (b) Michael A. Littman resigned
from all officer and employment positions with the Company and its subsidiaries, (c) Michael Singh was appointed Chief Executive Officer,
(d) Andrew Trumbach was appointed President, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer and (e) Lisa Marie Iannitelli was appointed
Executive Vice President, Director-Investor Relations. 

Contemporaneously,
the size of the Board of Directors of the Company was increased from three directors to six directors. Michael Singh was appointed as
Chairman of the Board and Andrew Trumbach and Lisa Marie Iannitelli were each appointed as a director, filling the vacancies on the Board
resulting from the increase to the size of the Board. 

Effective
as of January 7, 2022, Messrs. Littman, Smiley and Green each resigned as directors of the Company. Subsequently, Tyler A Trumbach, Claude
Stuart and Narendra Kini were appointed to the Board to fill the vacancies resulting from such January 7, 2022 resignations. 

In
February 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company determined to pursue a business strategy of acquiring, developing, and managing
residential vacation home communities in desirable travel destinations. 

On
May 18, 2022, we changed our name from JV Group, Inc. to Awaysis Capital, Inc. In connection with this name change, we changed our ticker
symbol from ASZP to AWCA and effective May 25, 2022, we began trading on the OTC Market under our new symbol. 

Our
Planned Business 

Our
planned business is expected to include real estate development and sales, hospitality rentals, resort operations and club management.
Revenues are expected to come from: 

selling
our own developed resort inventory that includes Condominiums, Single Family Homes, and Villas. 

providing
management services to our branded resorts under HOA management agreements; and 

manage
short-term unit rentals of sold and unsold inventory at the resorts we own or manage. 

The
Casamora Awaysis development, our first property, commenced sales and hospitality operations on or about November 1, 2022. 

Inventory
and Development Activities 

We
intend to acquire real estate assets to develop into resorts, starting in Belize and then expand into other resort markets as funds allow,
including building additional phases at existing resorts, including re-acquiring inventory from owners in default and in the open market
and sourcing other real estate assets from third parties. 

Our
development activities involving the acquisition of real estate are expected to be followed by construction or renovation to create integrated
resorts under the Awaysis banner and brand. These development activities, and the related management of construction activities,
are expected to be performed by us as developers and under a cost plus construction contract with R R Construction Company Limited
or other construction companies. The development and construction of the resorts require a large upfront investment of capital and can
take several years to complete in the case of a ground-up or partially completed project. 

Marketing
and Sales Activities 

Our
planned marketing and sales activities are expected to be based on targeted direct marketing and a highly personalized sales approach.
We intend to use targeted direct marketing to reach potential purchasers of units or sell through a licensed distribution network of
both in-market and off-site sales centers. Our products are expected to be marketed for sale or rent globally. 

Resort
Management Activities 

Resort
Management 

For
each resort property we acquire and develop, we intend for our management company subsidiary to enter into a management agreement. The
management company is expected to ensure that the resorts are well-maintained and financially stable, and the services provided are expected
to include day-to-day operations of the resort, maintenance of the resort, preparation of reports, budgets and projections and employee
training and oversight. The management agreements are expected to provide for a cost-plus management fee, which means we would generally
earn a fee over and above the cost to operate the applicable resort. As a result, the management fees we expect to earn would be predictable,
unlike traditional revenue-based hotel management fees, and our management fees generally would be unaffected by changes in rental rate
or occupancy. We also expect to be reimbursed for the costs incurred to perform our management services, principally related to personnel
providing on-site services. 

4 

Rental
of Available Inventory 

We
intend to rent unsold inventory at our resorts as well as to rent inventory that is sold on behalf of the owners. By using our websites
and other direct booking channels to rent available inventory, we intend to be able to reach potential new customers and introduce them
to our resorts. Inventory rentals would allow us to utilize otherwise unoccupied inventory to generate additional revenues and provision
of ancillary services. We expect that we will earn a fee from rentals of third-party inventory. Additionally, we intend to provide ancillary
offerings including food and beverage, retail, and spa offerings at our planned resorts. 

Competition 

The
resort and hotel industry are highly competitive and comprised of several national and regional companies that develop, finance and operate
resorts and hotels. 

Our
planned business will compete with other entities engaged in the leisure and vacation industry, including resorts, hotels, cruises, and
other accommodation alternatives, such as condominium and single-family home rentals. We also intend to compete with home and apartment
sharing services that operate websites that market available privately-owned residential properties that can be rented on a nightly,
weekly, or monthly basis. In certain markets, we may compete with timeshare operators, and it is possible that other potential competitors
may develop properties near our resort locations once acquired, developed, and marketed. 

Our
planned business will compete with the virtually thousands of other hotels, resorts and timeshare operators vying for vacation travelers,
in all cases based principally on location, quality of accommodations, price, service levels and amenities, financing terms, quality
of service, terms of property use, reservation systems, flexibility, as well as brand name recognition and reputation. We also compete
for property acquisitions and partnerships with entities that have similar investment and development objectives to us. 

We
believe that, in the competitive industry in which we intend to operate, trademarks, service marks, trade names and logos are very important
to the marketing and sales of products. While we have trademarked the name and logo Awaysis , which we believe is compelling,
it is a new brand and there are many other trademarks, service marks, trade names and logos that have much greater brand identification. 

There
is also significant competition for talent at all levels within the industry, especially in sales and management. 

Seasonality
and Cyclicality 

We
expect to experience seasonality in the rental segment of our planned business, with stronger revenue generation during traditional vacation
periods for those expected locations. Our business of selling units may be moderately cyclical as the demand for vacation units for sale
is affected by the availability and cost of financing for purchasers, as well as general economic conditions and the relative health
of the travel industry. We intend to offer owner financing up to 50 of the price of the units. 

Government
Regulation 

Our
proposed business is subject to various international, national, federal, state, and local laws, regulations and policies in jurisdictions
in which we intend to operate. Some laws, regulations and policies would impact multiple areas of our business, such as securities, anti-discrimination,
anti-fraud, data protection and security and anti-corruption and bribery laws and regulations or government economic sanctions, including
applicable regulations under the U.S. Treasury s Office of Foreign Asset Control and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA ).
The FCPA and similar anti-corruption and bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from
making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or generating business. Other laws, regulations and policies
primarily affect one of our areas of business: real estate development activities; marketing and sales activities; financial services
activities; and resort management activities. We will continue to be subject to applicable new legislation, rules and regulations that
have been proposed, or may be proposed, by federal, state and local authorities relating to the origination, servicing and securitization
of mortgage loans. 

Real
Estate Development Regulation 

Our
planned real estate development activities are regulated under a number of different statutes in the jurisdictions we intend to operate,
including Belize. We would generally be subject to laws and regulations typically applicable to real estate development, subdivision,
and construction activities, such as laws relating to zoning, land use restrictions, environmental regulation, accessibility, title transfers,
title insurance and taxation. In Belize, these include the equivalent to the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Accessibility
Guidelines promulgated thereunder. In addition, we may be subject to laws in some jurisdictions that impose liability on property developers
for construction defects discovered or repairs made by future owners of property developed by the developer. 

Marketing
and Sales Regulation 

Our
marketing and sales activities are expected to be highly regulated. A wide variety of laws and regulations govern our marketing and sales
activities, including regulations implementing the USA PATRIOT Act, Foreign Investment In Real Property Tax Act, the Federal Interstate
Land Sales Full Disclosure Act and fair housing statutes, U.S. Federal Trade Commission FTC and state Little FTC
Act and other regulations governing unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices including unfair or deceptive trade practices
and unfair competition, state attorney general regulations, anti-fraud laws, prize, gift and sweepstakes laws, real estate, title agency
or insurance and other licensing or registration laws and regulations, anti-money laundering, consumer information privacy and security,
breach notification, information sharing and telemarketing laws, home solicitation sales laws, tour operator laws, lodging certificate
and seller of travel laws and other consumer protection laws. 

We
expect that we must obtain the approval of numerous governmental authorities for our planned marketing and sales activities. Changes
in circumstances or applicable law may necessitate the application for or modification of existing approvals. 

5 

Resort
Management Regulation 

Our
planned resort management activities are expected to be subject to laws and regulations regarding community association management, public
lodging, food and beverage services, liquor licensing, labor, employment, health care, health and safety, accessibility, discrimination,
immigration, gaming, and the environment (including climate change). 

Environmental
Matters 

We
expect to be subject to certain requirements and potential liabilities under various U.S. federal, state and local and foreign environmental,
health and safety laws and regulations and incur costs in complying with such requirements. These laws and regulations govern actions
including air emissions, the use, storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances, and wastewater disposal. In addition to investigation
and remediation liabilities that could arise under such laws, we may also face personal injury, property damage, fines, or other claims
by third parties concerning environmental compliance or contamination. We expect to use and store hazardous and toxic substances, such
as cleaning materials, pool chemicals, heating oil and fuel for back-up generators at some of our planned facilities, and we expect to
generate certain wastes in connection with our planned operations. We may, from time to time, be responsible for investigating and remediating
contamination at some of our developed facilities, such as contamination that has been discovered when we have removed underground storage
tanks, and we could be held responsible for any contamination resulting from the disposal of wastes that we generate, including at locations
where such wastes have been sent for disposal. In some cases, we may be entitled to indemnification from the party that caused the contamination
pursuant to our management, construction, or renovation agreements, but there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all
or any costs we incur in addressing such problems. From time to time, we may also be required to manage, abate, remove, or contain mold,
lead, asbestos-containing materials, radon gas or other hazardous conditions found in or on our planned properties. 

Human
Capital 

Currently,
we have four full-time employees, including our executives. We presently do not have pension, health, annuity or, insurance; however,
we intend to adopt some or all of such employee benefits in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to any officers,
directors, or employees. Our employees are all based in the United States, at our office located in Mirimar, Florida. These employees
oversee day-to-day operations of the Company. As required, we also engage consultants to provide services to the Company both in the
U.S. and Belize, including real estate, regulatory, legal and corporate services. We are subject to labor laws and regulations that apply
to our locations in the U.S. and Belize. These laws and regulations principally concern matters such as pensions, paid annual vacation,
paid sick days, length of the workday and work week, minimum wages, overtime pay, insurance for work-related accidents, severance pay
and other conditions of employment. We have no unionized employees. 

We
believe we are able to attract and retain top talent by creating a culture that challenges and engages our employees, offering them opportunities
to learn, grow and achieve their career goals. 

We
provide competitive compensation for our employees. We may also offer annual bonuses and stock-based compensation for eligible employees. 

We
aim to provide our employees with advanced professional and development skills, so that they can perform effectively in their roles and
build their capabilities and career prospects for the future. 

We
strive to encourage a diversity of views and to create an equal opportunity workplace.

 Risk
Factors 

We
are subject to various risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity,
and stock price. You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below, in addition to the other information in this Current
Report on Form 8-K. Further, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to management or that management currently deems less
significant also may result in material and adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and
stock price. The risks below also include forward-looking statements; and actual results and events may differ substantially from those
discussed or highlighted in these forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 

Risk
Factor Summary 

Our
proposed business is subject to a number of risks of which you should be aware before making an investment decision. These risks include,
but are not limited to, the following: 

We
 are a development stage company with a limited operating history, making it difficult for you to evaluate our business and your investment. 

Since
 inception of our new business model, we have not established any material and recurring revenues or operations that will provide
 financial stability in the long term, and there can be no assurance that we will realize our plans on our projected timetable (or
 at all) in order to reach sustainable or profitable operations. 

We
 may never become profitable; 

We
 are dependent on management; 

The
 expansion of our operations can have a significant impact on our profitability; 

Our
 financial success is dependent on general economic conditions; 

Our
 operating results are subject to significant fluctuations; 

Our
 proposed objectives are capital intensive and subject to change; 

There
 is a limited trading market for our common stock, which could make it difficult for you to liquidate an investment in our common
 stock, in a timely manner; 

Our
 success will depend upon the acquisition of real estate, and we may be unable to consummate acquisitions or dispositions on advantageous
 terms, the acquired properties may not perform as expected, or we may be unable to efficiently integrate assets into our existing
 operations; 

6 

Investors are reliant on management s assessment, selection, and development of appropriate properties; 

We face significant increases in development costs; 

Our profitability may be impacted by delays in the selection, acquisition, and re-development of properties; 

Our management maintains full discretion in the future disposition of properties; 

Our properties may be subject to environmental laws and regulations that have the potential to impose liability; 

Real estate is not as liquid as other types of assets, which may reduce economic returns to investors; 

We may be unable to sell a property if or when we decide to do so, including as a result of uncertain market conditions, which could adversely affect the return on an investment in our Company; 

We may not succeed in creating a portfolio enclave strategy; 

Our properties may be subject to liabilities or other problems; 

The failure to successfully execute and integrate strategic acquisitions that support our long-term strategies could adversely affect our growth rate and consequently our revenues and results of operations; 

There are significant risks associated with value-add and properties in need of re-positioning; 

Uninsured losses relating to real property may adversely affect our performance; 

Competition for investment assets may increase costs and reduce returns; 

Environmental regulations and issues, certain of which we may have no control over, may adversely impact our business; 

Real estate may develop harmful mold, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediating the problem; 

Terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war may adversely affect our industry, operations, and profitability; 

We will be subject to risks related to the geographic locations of the properties we develop; 

There may be several conflicts of interest that arise as we implement our business plan; 

The market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile, which may adversely affect its market price; 

Your interest in us may be diluted if we issue additional shares of common stock. 

We cannot assure you that
 our common stock will become listed on a national securities exchange and the failure to do so may adversely affect your ability to
 dispose of our common stock in a timely fashion. 

Our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules of the SEC, which makes transactions in our stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our stock. 

Certain of our executive
 officers and directors, through their direct and indirect ownership of common stock, can substantially influence the outcome of
 matters requiring shareholder approval and may prevent you and other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions,
 which could result in conflicts of interest that could cause the Company s stock price to decline. 

Investments in our common stock may provide you with limited rights, and we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the short term. 

Risk
Factors 

We
are a development stage company with a limited operating history, making it difficult for you to evaluate our business and your investment. 

Our
operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including but not limited to the
absence of an operating history, lack of fully-developed or commercialized properties, insufficient capital, limited assets, expected
substantial and continual losses for the foreseeable future, limited experience in dealing with regulatory issues, lack of marketing
experience, need to rely on third parties for the development and commercialization of our proposed properties, a competitive environment
characterized by well-established and well-capitalized competitors and reliance on key personnel. 

7 

We
may not be successful in carrying out our business objectives. The revenue and income potential of our business and operations are unproven
as the lack of operating history makes it difficult to evaluate the future prospects of our business. There is nothing at this time on
which to base an assumption that our business operations will prove to be successful or that we will ever be able to operate profitably.
Accordingly, we have no track record of successful business activities, strategic decision-making by management, fund-raising ability,
and other factors that would allow an investor to assess the likelihood that we will be successful in our business. There is a substantial
risk that we will not be successful in fully implementing our business plan, or if initially successful, in thereafter generating material
operating revenues or in achieving profitable operations. 

Since
inception of our new business model, we have not established any material and recurring revenues or operations that will provide financial
stability in the long term, and there can be no assurance that we will realize our plans on our projected timetable (or at all) in order
to reach sustainable or profitable operations. 

Investors
are subject to all the risks incident to the creation and development of a new business and each investor should be prepared to withstand
a complete loss of his, her or its investment. Furthermore, the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we
will continue as a going concern. We have not emerged from the development stage and may be unable to raise further equity. These factors
raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Even
if we successfully develop and market our business plan, we may not generate sufficient or sustainable revenue to achieve or sustain
profitability, which could cause us to cease operations and cause you to lose all of your investment. Because we are subject to these
risks, you may have a difficult time evaluating our business and your investment in our Company. 

We
may never become profitable. 

To
become profitable, we must successfully implement our proposed business plan and strategies, either alone or in on conjunction with possible
collaborators. We may never have any significant recurring revenues or become profitable. 

We
are dependent on management. 

Our
business is and will continue to be significantly dependent on our management team. The loss of any member of our management team could
have a materially adverse effect on the Company. 

The
expansion of our operations can have a significant impact on our profitability . 

We
intend on expanding our business through the acquisition, development, and maintenance of real estate assets. Any expansion of operations
that we may undertake will entail risks, such actions may involve specific operational activities which may negatively impact our profitability.
Consequently, investors must assume the risk that (i) such expansion may ultimately involve expenditures of funds beyond the resources
available to us at that time, and (ii) management of such expanded operations may divert management s
attention and resources away from our existing operations, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our present and prospective
business activities. 

Our
financial success is dependent on general economic conditions. 

Our
financial success may be sensitive to adverse changes in general economic conditions in the United States, Belize and any other jurisdiction
in which our assets are located, such as recession, inflation, unemployment, geopolitical situations, and interest rates. Such changing
conditions could reduce demand in the marketplace for our planned real estate portfolio. We have no control over these changes. 

Our
operating results are subject to significant fluctuations. 

Our
operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of a variety of factors, including purchasing patterns
of customers, competitive pricing, debt service and principal reduction payments, and general economic conditions. Consequently, our
revenues may vary by quarter, and our operating results may experience fluctuations. 

Our
proposed objectives are capital intensive and subject to change. 

Our
proposed business plans may change. Many of our potential business endeavors are capital intensive and may be subject to statutory or
regulatory requirements. Management reserves the right, at any time, to make significant modifications to the Company s stated
strategies depending on future events. 

There
is a limited trading market for our common stock, which could make it difficult for you to liquidate an investment in our common stock,
in a timely manner. 

Our
common stock is currently traded on the OTC Pink market. Because there is a limited public market for our common stock, you may not be
able to liquidate your investment when you want. We cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will ever develop.
There is limited trading in our common stock, and we cannot assure you that an active public market for our common stock will ever develop.
The lack of an active public trading market means that you may not be able to sell your shares of common stock when you want, thereby
increasing your market risk. Until our common stock is listed on a national securities exchange, which we can provide no assurance, we
expect that it will continue to be listed on the OTC Pink market. An investor may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations as
to the market value of the common stock and the trading of our common stock may be extremely sporadic. For example, several days may
pass before any shares may be traded. A more active market for our common stock may never develop. In addition, if we failed to meet
the criteria set forth in SEC regulations, various requirements would be imposed by law on broker-dealers who sell our securities to
persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Consequently, such regulations may deter broker-dealers from recommending
or selling the common stock, which may further affect its liquidity. This would also make it more difficult for us to raise additional
capital. 

Our
success will depend upon the acquisition of real estate, and we may be unable to consummate acquisitions or dispositions on advantageous
terms, the acquired properties may not perform as expected, or we may be unable to efficiently integrate assets into our existing operations. 

We
intend to acquire, maintain, sell, and rent real estate assets. The acquisition of real estate entails various risks, including the risks
that our real estate assets may not perform as expected, that we may be unable to integrate assets quickly and efficiently into our existing
operations and that the cost estimates for the development or sale price of a property may prove inaccurate. 

8 

Investors
are reliant on management s assessment, selection, and development of appropriate properties. 

Our
ability to achieve our current objectives is dependent upon the performance of our management team in the quality and timeliness of our
acquisition and development of real estate properties. Investors have no opportunity to evaluate the terms of transactions or other economic
or financial data concerning our assets. Investors must rely entirely on the decisions of the management team and the oversight of our
principals. 

We
face significant competition that may increase costs. 

We
will experience significant competition from other sellers of real estate and other real estate projects. Competition may have the effect
of increasing our acquisition costs, making it more difficult to identify and close on the acquisition of desirable real estate properties,
and decrease the sales price or lease rates of developed assets. 

Our
profitability may be impacted by delays in the selection, acquisition, and development of properties. 

We
may encounter delays in the selection, acquisition and development of properties that could adversely affect our profitability. We may
experience delays in identifying properties that satisfy ideal purchase parameters. 

Our
management maintains full discretion in the future disposition of properties. 

We
cannot predict with any certainty the various market conditions affecting real estate assets which will exist at any particular time
in the future. Due to the uncertainty of market conditions which may affect the future disposition of our properties, we cannot assure
shareholders that we will be able to sell our properties at a profit in the future. Accordingly, the timing of liquidation of our real
estate assets will be dependent upon fluctuating market conditions. 

Our
properties may be subject to environmental laws and regulations that have the potential to impose liability. 

Under
various local environmental laws, ordinances, and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable
for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. Such laws often impose liability
whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. Environmental
laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may
require expenditures. Environmental laws provide for sanctions in the event of non-compliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies
or, in certain circumstances, by private parties. In connection with the acquisition and ownership of its properties, we may be potentially
liable for such costs. The cost of defending against claims of liability, complying with environmental regulatory requirements or remediation
of any contaminated property could have a materially adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations. 

Real
estate is not as liquid as other types of assets, which may reduce economic returns to investors. 

Real
estate assets are not as liquid as other types of investments, and this lack of liquidity may limit our ability to react promptly to
changes in economic, financial, investment or other conditions. In addition, significant expenditures associated with real estate investments,
such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in
income from the investments. Thus, our ability at any time to sell assets or contribute assets to property funds or other entities in
which we maintain an ownership interest may be restricted. This lack of liquidity may limit the ability to vary our portfolio promptly
in response to changes in economic, financial, investment or other conditions and, as a result, could adversely affect our financial
condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 

9 

We
may be unable to sell a property if or when it decides to do so, including as a result of uncertain market conditions, which could adversely
affect the return on an investment in our Company. 

Our
ability to dispose of properties on advantageous terms depends on factors, some of which are beyond our control, including competition
from other sellers and the availability of attractive financing for potential buyers of the properties acquired. We cannot predict the
various market conditions affecting real estate investments which will exist at any particular time in the future. Due to the uncertainty
of market conditions, which may affect the future disposition of the properties acquired, we cannot assure our shareholders that we will
be able to sell such properties at a profit in the future. Accordingly, the extent to which our shareholders will receive cash dividends
and realize potential appreciation on real estate investments will be dependent upon fluctuating market conditions. Furthermore, we may
be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. Funds may not be available to correct
such defects or to make such improvements. In acquiring a property, we may agree to restrictions that prohibit the sale of that property
for a period of time or impose other restrictions, such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property.
These provisions would restrict our ability to sell a property. 

We
may not succeed in creating a portfolio enclave strategy. 

The
acquisition of assets is critical to our ability to enter new emerging markets and build local market density. This strategy will contribute
to our ability to grow sales and rental revenues and increase profitability over time. In order to build on this concept of creating
vacation-remote work enclave communities, we must be able to identify and maintain a pipeline of locally managed vacation homes and condominiums
in new and emerging markets. We have been able to find existing shovel ready resorts and vacation properties by giving developers and
owners an exit strategy and providing market and developmental expertise to reposition the acquired assets to maximize revenues, but
that may not continue. Our ability to maintain this momentum depends on our ability to provide a unique travel experience to both owners
and guests and to be able to consistently generate income to the residence owners. Our ability to provide this level of income and expectations
are likely to be partially dependent on the labor cost of our local markets and our ability to hire teams for a diversity of roles at
a reasonable cost given the constraints of each particular local market environment. 

Our
properties may be subject to liabilities or other problems. 

We
intend to perform certain due diligence for each property or other real estate related asset that we acquire. We will also seek to obtain
appropriate representations and indemnities from sellers with respect to such properties or other investments. We may, nevertheless,
acquire properties or other investments that are subject to uninsured liabilities or that otherwise have problems. In some instances,
we may have only limited or perhaps even no recourse for any such liabilities or other problems or, if we received indemnification from
a seller, the resources of such seller may not be adequate to fulfill its indemnity obligation. As a result, we could be required to
resolve or cure any such liability or other problems, and such payment could have an adverse effect on our cash flow available to meet
other expenses or to make dividend payments to shareholders. 

The
failure to successfully execute and integrate strategic acquisitions that support our long-term strategies could adversely affect our
growth rate and consequently our revenues and results of operations. 

We
expect to acquire multiple properties at any given time. If we are not able to consummate these strategic acquisitions, it could negatively
impact our growth rate, revenue results, results of operations and the trading prices of our common stock. Furthermore, strategic acquisitions
and other strategic transactions and relationships involve a number of financial, accounting, operational, legal, compliance and other
risks and challenges, any of which could negatively affect our growth rate revenue results, results of operations and the trading price
of our common stock and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

There
are significant risks associated with value-add and properties in need of re-positioning. 

Our
targeting of financially distressed properties (and, in some cases, raw land) may result in properties which are partially leased or
completely vacant and thus not generating positive cash flow (or any cash flow). Similarly, under-performing and value-add properties
that we are targeting may experience unanticipated delays in, or increases of the cost to improve or reposition those properties that
may be beyond our control. There is no assurance we will be successful in stabilizing such properties given the significant number of
factors beyond our control, including general or local economic conditions and local market demand that may come into play. These types
of properties may pose greater investment risk than fully stabilized properties. 

Uninsured
losses relating to real property may adversely affect our performance. 

We
will attempt to ensure that all of its properties are comprehensively insured (including liability, fire, storm and extended coverage)
in amounts sufficient to permit replacement in the event of a total loss, subject to applicable deductibles. However, in the event such
insurance is not sufficient, or if we do not have a sufficient external source of funding to repair or reconstruct a damaged property
our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that any such source of funding
will be available to us for such purposes in the future. 

Competition
for investments may increase costs and reduce returns. 

We
will experience competition for real property investments from individuals, corporations, banks, and insurance company investment accounts,
as well as other real estate limited partnerships, real estate investment funds, commercial developers, pension plans, other institutional
and foreign investors and other entities engaged in real estate investment activities. We will compete against other potential purchasers
of properties of high-quality commercial properties leased to credit-worthy tenants and residential properties and, as a result of the
weakened world economy, there is greater competition for the properties of the type in which we will invest. Some of these competing
entities may have greater financial and other resources allowing them to compete more effectively. This competition may result in us
paying higher prices to acquire properties than it otherwise would, or we may be unable to acquire properties that we believe meet our
investment objectives and are otherwise desirable investments. 

In
addition, our properties may be located close to properties that are owned by other real estate investors and that compete with us for
tenants. These competing properties may be better located and more suitable for desirable tenants than our properties, resulting in a
competitive advantage for these other properties. We may face similar competition from other properties that may be developed in the
future. This competition may limit our ability to lease space, increase its costs of securing tenants, and limit our ability to charge
rents and/or require us to make capital improvements we otherwise might not make to our properties. As a result, we may suffer reduced
cash flow with a decrease in share price and/or the ability to provide dividends. 

10 

Environmental
regulations and issues, certain of which we may have no control over, may adversely impact our business. 

Federal,
state, and local laws and regulations impose environmental controls, disclosure rules and zoning restrictions which directly impact the
management, development, use, and/or sale of real estate. Such laws and regulations tend to discourage sales and leasing activities and
mortgage lending with respect to some properties, and may therefore adversely affect us specifically, and the real estate industry in
general. Failure to uncover and adequately protect against environmental issues in connection with a portfolio investment may subject
us to liability as the buyer of such property or asset. Environmental laws and regulations impose liability on current or previous real
property owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances
at the property. 

We
may be held liable for such costs as a subsequent owner and developer of such property. Liability can be imposed even if the original
actions were legal, and we had no knowledge of the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. 

We
may also be held responsible for the entire payment of the liability if we are subject to joint and several liabilities and the other
responsible parties are unable to pay. Further, we may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting
from environmental contamination emanating from the site, including the presence of asbestos containing materials. Insurance for such
matters may not be available. Additionally, new or modified environmental regulations could develop in a manner which could adversely
affect us. 

Real
estate may develop harmful mold, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediating the problem. 

When
excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains
undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Concern about indoor exposure
to mold has been increasing as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergies or other
reactions. 

As
a result, the presence of significant mold at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain
or remove the mold from the affected property. In addition, the presence of significant mold could expose us to liability from its tenants,
employees of such tenants and others if property damage or health concerns arise. 

Terrorist
attacks or other acts of violence or war may adversely affect our industry, operations, and profitability. 

Terrorist
attacks or other acts of violence or war may harm our results of operations. There can be no assurance that these attacks or armed conflicts,
whether international or domestic, will not occur. These attacks or armed conflicts may directly or indirectly impact the value of the
property we own or that secures our loans. Losses resulting from these types of events may be uninsurable or not insurable to the full
extent of the loss suffered. Moreover, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased
volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. These attacks or armed conflicts could also result in economic
uncertainty in the United States or abroad. Adverse economic conditions resulting from terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or
war could reduce demand for space in our properties due to the adverse effect on the economy and thereby reduce the value of our properties. 

We
will be subject to risks related to the geographic locations of the properties we develop. 

We
intend to acquire, maintain, and sell real estate assets. If the commercial or residential real estate markets or general economic conditions
in the geographic areas in which we intend to operate declines, we may experience a greater rate of default by tenants on their leases
with respect to properties in these areas and the value of the properties in these areas could decline. Any of these events could materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

There
may be several conflicts of interest that arise as we implement our business plan. 

Certain
of our officers and directors and our affiliates may engage, for their own account, or for the account of others, in other business ventures
similar to ours or otherwise, and neither we nor any shareholder shall be entitled to any interest therein. Our management will devote
only so much time to our business as is reasonably required. If a specific business venture becomes available, such person(s) may face
a conflict in selecting between our business and his or her other business interests. We have not yet formulated a policy for the resolution
of such conflicts. We will not share in the risks or rewards of such other ventures; however, such other ventures will compete for their
time and attention, which might create other conflicts of interest. We do not at this time require our officers or directors to devote
any particular amount of time to the Company. As a result, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
We are buying certain assets in our portfolio from certain of our officers and directors. Even though these will be purchased with arms-length
appraisals, there is still an inherent conflict between the roles of certain officers and/or directors acting and representing the sellers
and buyers in the same transaction. 

The
market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile, which may adversely affect its market price. 

The
market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to factors such as: 

actual
 or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition or results of operations; 

the
 success or failure of our operating strategies and our perceived prospects; realization of any of the risks described in this section;
 failure to be covered by securities analysts or failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts; 

a
 decline in the stock prices of peer companies; and 

a
 discount in the trading multiple of our common stock relative to that of common stock of certain of our peer companies due to perceived
 risks associated with our smaller size. 

11 

As
a result, shares of our common stock may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid to acquire them. Furthermore, declines
in the price of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to conduct future offerings or to recruit and retain key employees,
including our managing directors and other key professional employees. 

Your
interest in us may be diluted if we issue additional shares of common stock. 

In
general, shareholders do not have preemptive rights to any common stock issued by us in the future. Therefore, shareholders may experience
dilution of their equity investment if we issue additional shares of common stock in the future, including shares issuable under equity
incentive plans, or if we issue securities that are convertible into shares of our common stock, which we intend to do. 

We
cannot assure you that our common stock will become listed on a securities exchange and the failure to do so may adversely affect your
ability to dispose of our common stock in a timely fashion. 

We
plan to seek listing of our common stock on NASDAQ or another national securities exchange as soon as reasonably practicable. We may
not currently meet the initial listing standards of any of those exchanges or any other stock exchange and cannot assure you when or
if we will meet the listing standards, or that we will be able to maintain a listing of the common stock on any stock
exchange. 

Our
common stock is subject to the penny stock rules of the SEC, which makes transactions in our stock cumbersome and may reduce
the value of an investment in our stock. 

The
SEC has adopted regulations which generally define a penny stock as an equity security that has a market price of less
than 5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. The SEC s penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction
in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about
penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations
for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and the salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing
the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account. In addition, the penny stock rules generally require that
before a transaction in a penny stock occurs, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable
investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s agreement to the transaction. If applicable in the future, these rules
may restrict the ability of brokers-dealers to sell our common stock and may affect the ability of investors to sell their shares, until
our common stock no longer is considered a penny stock. 

Certain
of our executive officers and directors, through their direct and indirect ownership of common stock, can substantially influence
the outcome of matters requiring shareholder approval and may prevent you and other stockholders from influencing significant
corporate decisions, which could result in conflicts of interest that could cause the Company s stock price to
decline. 

Harthorne
Capital, Inc., which is owned by certain of our executive officers and directors, along with Mr. Singh and Dr. Trumbach,
collectively beneficially owns shares of our common stock equal to approximately 80 of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a
result, such individuals will have the ability, acting together, to substantially influence the election of our directors and the
outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as: (i) a merger or a sale of our Company, (ii) a sale of all or
substantially all of our assets, and (iii) amendments to our articles of incorporation and bylaws. This concentration of voting
power and control could have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing an action that might otherwise be beneficial
to our other shareholders and be disadvantageous to our shareholders with interests different from those individuals. These
individuals also have significant control over our business, policies and affairs as officers and/or directors of our Company. These
stockholders may exert influence in delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company, even if such change in control would
benefit the other stockholders of the Company. Lastly, the significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the
market value of the Company s common stock due to investors perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.
Therefore, you should not invest in reliance on your ability to have any control over the Company. In addition, stock ownership of
insiders and management, at high levels of ownership, may induce executive decisions inconsistent with growth-oriented
risk-taking. 

Investments
in our common stock may provide you with limited rights, and we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the short term. 

Common
stock and similar equity securities generally represent the most junior position in an issuer s capital structure and, as such,
generally entitle holders to an interest in the assets of the issuer, if any, remaining after all more senior claims to such assets have
been satisfied. Holders of common stock generally are entitled to dividends only if and to the extent declared by the governing body
of the issuer out of income or other assets available after making interest, dividend, and any other required payments on more senior
securities of the issuer. We anticipate that we will retain our earnings, if any, for future growth and therefore do not anticipate paying
cash dividends on our common stock in the short term. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock for that
purpose.

Overview 

We
are a real estate investment and management company focused on acquisition, construction, selling and managing vacation rentals of residential
vacation home communities in desirable travel destinations. We seek to create value through the targeting and acquisition, development,
and up-cycling, rebranding, and repositioning of currently undervalued operating and shovel ready residential/resort communities in global
travel destinations, with the intention to relaunch these assets under the Awaysis brand with the goals of creating a network
of residential and resort enclave communities that will optimize both sales and rental revenues, providing attractive returns to owners
and exceptional vacation experiences to travelers. At least initially, our target acquisitions are resorts that have not been completed
nor have a prior operational history. As such we intend to purchase the real estate and finish the development, then we would sell the
finished units and put them in a rental pool. 

The
Company seeks to own and grow a stable, cash generating, diversified portfolio of single-family and luxury resort/residence properties
in the Caribbean, Europe, South America, and the United States. 

Our
business strategy entails targeting and identifying undervalued assets in emerging markets located in proximity to high demand travel
destinations. The Company intends to focus these efforts on shovel-ready properties and/or other assets that we believe can be used to
optimize sales and rental revenues. We have currently identified five properties in the country of Belize, all of which are expected
to constitute our initial real estate portfolio. To that effect, on June 30, 2022, we closed on the acquisition of certain real estate
assets in San Pedro, Belize (the Casamora Awaysis Assets ), pursuant to our previously announced series of Agreements of
Purchase and Sale, all dated April 15, 2022. The total consideration paid by us for the properties subject to the agreements was at the
appraisal value of 11.4 million (excluding transaction costs and fees) and was settled in a combination of a Purchase Money Mortgage
of 2.6 million at 0 interest rate, payable on demand, a Purchase Money Mortgage of 280,000 at 0 interest rate that was paid on August
8, 2022 and 56.8 million shares of the Company s common stock based on a per share price equal to the market price on the date
of appraisal of 0.150. As the first acquisition by the Company in Belize and an important milestone, the Company expects to rebrand
the Casamora Awaysis Asset, so it is easily identifiable as an Awaysis Property and fit perfectly with its strategy of creating a countrywide
network of Awaysis residential enclave communities in the country for owners and guests to travel, work and play. 

Revenues 

As
of June 30, 2023 our revenue consists primarily of monthly rental income of villas and commission from the sale of real property. 

Sales
and Marketing Expenses 

Our
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions and other personnel-related expenses, which may include share-based
compensation, for employees engaged in sales, marketing and support of our products and services, promotional and public relations expenses
and management and administration expenses in support of sales and marketing. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

Our
general and administrative costs include payroll, employee benefits, and other personnel-related costs, which include share-based compensation,
associated with administrative and support staff, as well as legal and accounting costs, insurance costs, and other administrative fees. 

Results
of Operations Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 

We
commenced activities and started to incur material costs in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, as a result of our change in
control transaction in November 2021 and commencement in February 2022 of our business strategy of acquiring, developing, and
managing residential vacation home communities in desirable travel destinations. Our business strategy continued throughout the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, showing substantial growth in operating expenses in preparation for expected future growth in
revenue. 

We
have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern
and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities
that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. 

We
expect we will require additional capital to meet our long-term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through,
among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities. 

Revenues 

We
recognized revenue of 107,760 and -0- during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Revenue generated during fiscal year
2023 consisted of a few months worth of a monthly rental of 2 units and commissions from a property sale. Fiscal year 2022 had no
revenue generating activities during this period. 

Sales
and Marketing Expenses 

During
the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we incurred sales and marketing expenses of 91,319 and 49,269, respectively,
consisting of marketing and support of our products and services, promotional and public relations expenses and management and
administration expenses in support of sales and marketing. 

15 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

During
the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we incurred general and administrative expenses of 4,312,499 and 190,582,
respectively, consisting of audit and accounting fees, travel and entertainment, payroll and employee benefits, legal fees, filing
fees and transfer agent fees, all relating to both sustaining the corporate existence of the Company and public company-related
expenses and transitioning from being a shell company to an operating company under its new management. 

Operating
Loss 

During
the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we recognized operating losses of (4,296,058) and (239,851), respectively. These
losses were primarily attributable to increased operating expenses related to salaries due to the Company transitioning from being a
shell company to an operating company under its new management and brand. 

Other
Income (Expenses) 

During
the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we incurred interest expenses of 612 and 0, respectively, consisting of a gain on
foreign exchange transaction and interest earned. 

Net
Loss 

During
the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we recognized net losses of (4,295,446) and (239,851), respectively. These losses
were primarily attributable to accounting, marketing, legal, filing fees and transfer agent fees to sustaining the corporate
existence of the Company and public company related expenses, and transitioning from being a shell company to an operating company
under its new management and brand. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of June 30, 2023, we had cash of 79 and had a positive working capital of 5,742,463, of which was mainly from the issuance of
shares for real estate inventory and sale of shares from our private placement of common stock. We do not have sufficient cash or commitments for
funding to satisfy our basic operations for at least 12 months, and expect the anticipated cost of development of our first
properties to come from pre-sales, investors subscriptions, advances from its principal shareholders and not cash-on-hand. We will
need to raise additional cash to satisfy both our short and long-term requirements. 

Historically,
our principal shareholder has advanced funds on our behalf as we have required for the Company to become, and remain, a fully
reporting public company while seeking to create value for shareholders by pursuing our business plan to reinvent the Company as a
real estate investment and management company. The shareholder has indicated its intention to continue to do so; provided, however,
that such intentions do not represent a binding commitment by the principal shareholder and there is no guarantee that our principal
shareholder will be able to provide the funding necessary to achieve this objective. To date, our principal shareholder has advanced an aggregate of approximately 255,000 on behalf of the Company
to cover certain of the Company s expenses. Neither the shareholder nor the Company have entered into any agreement with respect
to the terms and conditions of such advances, including any repayment terms, although we expect to do so. 

If
we are unable to obtain additional advances from our principal shareholder, we anticipate facing major challenges in raising the necessary
funding to affect our business plan. Raising debt or equity funding for small publicly quoted, penny stock companies is extremely challenging.
We can provide no assurance that financing will be available in the amounts it needs or on terms acceptable to it, if at all. If we are
not able to secure adequate additional working capital when it becomes needed, it may be required to make reductions in spending, extend
payment terms with suppliers, liquidate assets where possible and/or suspend or curtail planned acquisitions and developments. Any of
these actions could materially harm our planned business. 

Our
plan for satisfying our cash requirements and to remain operational for the next 12 months and beyond or to further expand our asset
base is through the sale of shares of our capital stock to third parties and advances from our principal shareholder. While we
are seeking to raise up to 25 million through the sale of our common stock or through other offerings of securities, we cannot assure you we will be
successful in raising any or all of such capital and in meeting our working capital needs. Through June 30, 2023, we have raised an
aggregate of 1,918,000 in our recent private placement and can give no assurance that we will be successful in raising the remaining
funds being sought. The capital raises from issuances of equity securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders.
In addition, to the extent we determine to incur indebtedness, our incurrence of debt could result in debt service obligations and
operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations.

are dependent upon the receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund our ongoing operations and to execute our business plan
to become a real estate investment and management company. In addition, we are dependent upon our controlling shareholder to provide
continued funding and capital resources. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, we may not be
able to implement our plan of operations. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
company applies judgment and estimates that may have material effect in the eventual outcome of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
accounts receivable, inventory and goodwill. The following explains the basis and the procedure where judgment and estimates are applied. 

Inventories 

New
real estate inventory is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of finished inventories determined on the specific
identification method is removed from inventories and recorded as a component of cost of sales at the time revenue is recognized. In
addition, an allocation of depreciation and amortization is included in cost of goods sold. Under the specific identification method,
if finished real estate inventory can be sold for a profit there is no basis to write down the inventory below the lower of cost or net
realizable value. 

Going
Concern 

Our
financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities
in the normal course of business. As reflected in the financial statements, we had an accumulated deficit at June 30, 2023 and 2022,
a net loss and net cash used in operating activities for the reporting periods then ended. As of the fiscal years ended June 30,
2023 and 2022, we had cash in the amount of 79 and 481,965, respectively. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, we had executed
subscriptions pending funding in the amount of 943,000 and 1,193,000, respectively. 

The
Company is commencing operations and seeking to generate sufficient revenue to support its current basic operations for at least the
next 12 months; however, the Company s current cash position is not sufficient to support the Company s strategy. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue to
further develop its first properties through presales, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to
continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement its business plan, generate
sufficient revenue through presales or otherwise, and its ability to raise additional funds by way of private offering or debt. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or
the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The
Company needs to implement disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s
Exchange Act reports are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

17 

As
of June 30, 2023, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an assessment, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our then existing disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b).
As of the date of this assessment, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures, primarily as a result of the Company s recent transitions with respect to its auditor and its CFO. The Company s management is seeking to remedy this deficiency. Additionally, we have implemented a quarterly newsletter
to communicate to our Board and investor community. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a
 15(f) of the Exchange Act). There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility
of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control
may vary over time. We have assessed the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a -15(f)
of the Exchange Act) as of June 30, 2023, and have concluded that, as of June 30, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting
was effective. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of
the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, identified in connection with the evaluation of such internal
control that occurred during our last fiscal quarter and year that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Committees
of the Board of Directors 

Structure
and Operation of the Board 

Presently, our Board of Directors maintains a standing Audit Committee that does not yet satisfy Nasdaq s definition
of independence. The Company does not have a standing compensation or nominating committee. However, the full Board performs all of the
functions of a standing compensation committee and nominating committee. The Board currently consists of six directors: Mr. Singh (Chairman),
Dr. Trumbach, Ms. Iannitelli, Dr. Stuart, Dr. Kini and Mr. Trumbach. The following is a brief description of these functions of the Board: 

Nomination
of Directors 

The
Board does not currently have a standing nominating committee, and thus we do not have a nominating committee charter. Due to our small
size and limited operations to date, the Board determined that it was appropriate for the entire Board to act as the nominating committee.
The full Board currently has the responsibility of selecting individuals to be nominated for election to the Board. Board candidates
are typically identified by existing directors or members of management. The Board will consider director candidates recommended by shareholders.
Any such candidates will be evaluated on the same basis as other candidates being evaluated by the Board. Information with respect to
such candidates should be sent to Awaysis Capital, Inc., 3400 Lakeview Drive, Suite 100, Miramar, FL 33027; c/o Chairman. The Board considers
the needs for the Board as a whole when identifying and evaluating nominees and, among other things, considers diversity in background,
age, experience, qualifications, attributes and skills in identifying nominees, although it does not have a formal policy regarding the
consideration of diversity. 

Audit
Committee 

Our
recently-formed Audit Committee consists of Messrs. Trumbach, Stuart and Kini. The Board has determined that Messrs. Stuart and Kini
are independent, and Mr. Trumbach is an audit committee financial expert as defined in SEC rules, although he is not independent.
The Audit Committee has not yet adopted a written charter but expects to do so. 

The
primary functions of the Audit Committee are to assist the Board in overseeing (i) the effectiveness of the Company s accounting
and financial reporting processes and internal controls and the audits of the Company s financial statements, (ii) the qualifications,
independence, appointment, retention, compensation and performance of the Company s registered public accounting firm, and (iii)
the performance of the Company s internal audit department or department or person(s) having the equivalent responsibility and
functions. 

Because
the Company s common stock is traded on the OTC Pink market, the Company is not subject to the listing requirements of any securities
exchange regarding audit committee related matters. 

Risk
Oversight 

The
Board s risk oversight is administered primarily through the following: 

review and approval of an annual business plan; 

review of a summary of risks and opportunities at meetings of the Board; 

review of business developments, business plan implementation and financial results; 

oversight of internal controls over financial reporting; and 

review of employee compensation and its relationship to our business plans. 

Due
to the small size and early stage of the Company, we have not adopted a formal policy on whether there should be a separate Non-Executive
Chairman. 

Compensation
Committee Related Function 

The
Board does not currently have a standing compensation committee, and thus we do not have a compensation committee charter. Due to our
small size and limited operations to date, the Board determined that it was appropriate for the entire Board to act as the compensation
committee. The full Board currently has the responsibility for reviewing and establishing compensation for executive officers and making
policy decisions concerning salaries and incentive compensation for executive officers of the Company. 

20 

The
Company s executive compensation program is administered by the Board, which determines the compensation of the executive officers
of the Company. In reviewing the compensation of the individual executive officers, the Board intends to consider the recommendations
of the executive officers, published compensation surveys and current market conditions.

Code
of Business Conduct and Ethics 

We
adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to, among other persons, our principal executive officers, principal financial
officer, principal accounting officer or controller, and persons performing similar functions. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
is filed with this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Corporate
Governance 

Section
16(a) Reports 

Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers, directors, and persons who own more than 10 of a registered class of our
equity securities, to file with the SEC reports of ownership of our securities and changes in reported ownership. Executive
officers, directors and greater than 10 beneficial owners are required by SEC rules to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a)
reports they file. Based solely on a review of the copies of such forms furnished to us, or written representations from the
reporting persons that no Form 5 was required, we believe that, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, with the exception of
one untimely Form 3 for Mr. Amir Vasquez, our former CFO, and one untimely Form 4 for each of Tyler Trumbach and Narendra Kini, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to our officers,
directors and greater than 10 beneficial owners have been met.

and director nominees, (ii) each of our named executive officers, (iii) all of our current directors and executive officers as a

 beneficial ownership refers to shares that an individual or entity has the power to vote or dispose of, and any rights
to acquire common stock that are currently exercisable or will become exercisable within 60 days of October 10, 2023. We calculated

252,227,053 shares outstanding as of October 10, 2023. In addition, shares issuable pursuant to options or other convertible
securities that may be acquired within 60 days of October 10, 2023 are deemed to be issued and outstanding and have been treated as
outstanding in calculating and determining the beneficial ownership and percentage ownership of those persons possessing those
securities, but not for any other persons.

Item
13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. 

Related
Person Transaction 

The
Board intends to implement a policy to review, approve and oversee any transaction between us and any related person and any other potential
conflict of interest situations on an ongoing basis, and develops policies and procedures for the approval of related party transactions.
Prior to consideration of a transaction with a related person, the material facts as to the related person s relationship or interest
in the transaction would be disclosed to the disinterested directors. The transaction would not be approved unless a majority of the
members of the Board who are not interested in the transaction approve the transaction. The Board intends to take into account, among
other factors that it deems appropriate, whether the related person transaction is on terms no less favorable to us than terms generally
available in a transaction with an unrelated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related person s
interest in the related person transaction. 

Each
of Mr. Singh, Dr. Trumbach and Ms. Iannitelli are Executive Directors of Harthorne, the owner of approximately 38.7 of the issued and
outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. 

During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, Harthorne advanced 255,489 and 12,497, respectively, relating to costs paid on behalf of the Company. 

Tyler Trumbach, a director of the Company and its
Chief Legal Officer, performed certain general counsel and legal services for the Company through The Law Offices of Tyler A. Trumbach,
P.A., and in September 2022, received through his holding company River Rock Holdings, Inc., 333,333 shares of the Company s common
stock as payment in full for 50,000 of legal services provided by such firm. 

Family
Relationships 

Tyler
Trumbach, the Company s Chief Legal Counsel and a director, is the son of Dr. Andrew Trumbach, the president and a director of
the Company. There are no other familial relationships between any of our officers and directors. 

Apart
from the disclosures set forth under this Item 13, there have been no related party transactions, or any other transactions or relationships
required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K. 

Director
Independence 

We
use the definition of independence of The NASDAQ Stock Market to make this determination. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2)
provides that an independent director is a person other than an officer or employee of the company or any other individual
having a relationship, which, in the opinion of the Company s Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment
in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The NASDAQ listing rules provide that a director cannot be considered independent
if: 

The director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an employee of the company; 

The director or a family member of the director accepted any compensation from the company in excess of 120,000 during any period
of 12 consecutive months within the three years preceding the independence determination (subject to certain exclusions, including,
among other things, compensation for board or board committee service); 

A family member of the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an executive officer of the company; 

The director or a family member of the director is a partner in, controlling shareholder of, or an executive officer of an entity to
which the company made, or from which the company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that
exceed 5 of the recipient s consolidated gross revenue for that year or 200,000, whichever is greater (subject to certain
exclusions); 

The director or a family member of the director is employed as an executive officer of an entity where, at any time during the past
three years, any of the executive officers of the company served on the compensation committee of such other entity; or 

The director or a family member of the director is a current partner of the company s outside auditor, or at any time during
the past three years was a partner or employee of the company s outside auditor, and who worked on the company s
audit. 

25 

Under
such definitions, two of our directors can be considered independent. 

Item

Board of Directors has reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements of Awaysis Capital, Inc. for the fiscal year

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To
the shareholders and the board of directors of Awaysis Capital, Inc. 

Opinion
on the Financial Statements 

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Awaysis Capital, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 30, 2023,
the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and
the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. 

The
financial statements of the Company as of June 30, 2022 and for the year then ended were audited by other auditors whose report dated
November 4, 2023, on those statements included an explanatory paragraph that described the substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements 

Substantial
Doubt about the Company s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
3 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In
addition, the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis
for Opinion 

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company s consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB. 

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our
audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical
Audit Matter 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. 

We determined that there are no critical audit matters. 

We
have served as the Company s auditor since 2023.

will hold payments made by guest in advance of reservations in a restricted escrow accounts until the rescission period expires in accordance
with U.S. state regulations. 

The
Company recognizes lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company s lease agreements may contain variable
costs such as common area maintenance, operating expenses or other costs. Variable lease costs are expensed as incurred on the consolidated
statements of operations. 

We
determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use ROU as assets, operating lease non-current liabilities, and operating lease current liabilities in our balance sheet. Finance leases are
property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other non-current liabilities in the balance sheet. 

ROU
assets represent the right to use an asset for the lease term and lease liability represent the obligation to make lease payment arising
from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease
payments over lease term. As most of the leases doesn t provide an implicit rate, we generally use the incremental borrowing rate
on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating
ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. Lease expense for lease payment is recognized on a straight-line
basis over lease term. 

We

 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on
de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. 

The
estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying
balance sheets, as well as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred
tax assets recorded on its balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary. 

Management
makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates
of tax liability. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions.
In management s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction
varies from estimates, additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary. 

The
Company currently derives its revenue primarily from the short-term unit rentals of sold and unsold inventory at the resort we own and
manage. 

Revenue
from rentals is recognized over the period in which a guest completes a stay.

The
Company is commencing operations and seeking to generate sufficient revenue to support its current basic operations for at least the
next 12 months; however, the Company s cash position is not sufficient to support the Company s - strategy.
While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue to further
develop its first properties through presales, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as
a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement its business plan, generate sufficient revenue
through presales or otherwise, and its ability to raise additional funds by way of private offering or debt. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts

separation from service with the Company (or the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A of the Code), and the Company will
pay any such delayed amounts in a lump sum at such time. If any other payments of money or other benefits due to the Employee hereunder
could cause the application of an accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, such payments or other benefits shall
be deferred if deferral will make such payment or other benefits compliant under Section 409A of the Code, or otherwise such payment
or other benefits shall be restructured, to the extent possible, in a manner, determined by the Company, that does not cause such an
accelerated or additional tax. To the extent any reimbursements or in-kind benefits due to the Employee under this Agreement constitute

Employee in a manner consistent with Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv). Each payment made under this Agreement shall be designated

provision in this Agreement providing for any right of offset or set-off by the Company shall not permit any offset or set-off against
payments of non-qualified deferred compensation for purposes of Section 409A of the Code or other amounts or payments to
the extent that such offset or set-off would result in any violation of Section 409A or adverse tax consequences to the Employee under
Section 409A.

Agreement and the matters contemplated herein. To the extent that he declines to receive independent legal counsel in respect of the

the party giving any notice knows or ought reasonably to know of any difficulties with the postal system that might affect the delivery
of mail, any such notice may not be mailed but must be given by personal delivery. In the case of electronic delivery, on the same day
that it was sent if sent on a business day and the acknowledgement of receipt is received by the sender before 5:00 p.m. (in the place
of receipt) on such day, and otherwise on the first business day thereafter. 

6.10
 Jurisdiction . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida. Each of the

6.11
 Section 409A . This Agreement is intended to comply with or be exempt from Section 409A of the Code and will be interpreted, administered
and operated in a manner consistent with that intent. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at the time of the Employee s
separation from service with the Company he is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A of the Code (and the regulations
thereunder) and any payments or benefits otherwise payable hereunder as a result of such separation from service are subject to Section
409A of the Code, then the Company will defer the commencement of the payment of any such payments or benefits hereunder (without any
reduction in such payments or benefits ultimately paid or provided to the Employee) until the date that is six months following the Employee s
separation from service with the Company (or the earliest date as is permitted under Section 409A of the Code), and the Company will
pay any such delayed amounts in a lump sum at such time. If any other payments of money or other benefits due to the Employee hereunder
could cause the application of an accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, such payments or other benefits shall
be deferred if deferral will make such payment or other benefits compliant under Section 409A of the Code, or otherwise such payment
or other benefits shall be restructured, to the extent possible, in a manner, determined by the Company, that does not cause such an
accelerated or additional tax. To the extent any reimbursements or in-kind benefits due to the Employee under this Agreement constitute
 deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, any such reimbursements or in-kind benefits shall be paid to the
Employee in a manner consistent with Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv). Each payment made under this Agreement shall be designated
as a separate payment within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. References to termination of employment 
and similar terms used in this Agreement are intended to refer to separation from service within the meaning of Section
409A of the Code to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code. Whenever a payment under this Agreement may be paid
within a specified period, the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Company.
In no event may the Employee, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of any payment to be made under this Agreement. Any
provision in this Agreement providing for any right of offset or set-off by the Company shall not permit any offset or set-off against
payments of non-qualified deferred compensation for purposes of Section 409A of the Code or other amounts or payments to
the extent that such offset or set-off would result in any violation of Section 409A or adverse tax consequences to the Employee under
Section 409A. 

6.12
 Independent Legal Advice . The Employee acknowledges that he has been advised to seek independent legal counsel in respect of the
Agreement and the matters contemplated herein. To the extent that he declines to receive independent legal counsel in respect of the
Agreement, he waives the right, should a dispute later develop, to rely on his lack of independent legal counsel to avoid his obligations,
to seek indulgences from the Company or to otherwise attack the integrity of the Agreement and the provisions thereof, in whole or in
part.
