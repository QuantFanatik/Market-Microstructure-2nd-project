Item
1. Business. 

General
Development of Business 

Overview 

We
intend to commence business operations by offering real estate management services for clients that focus on cost-efficient operations
and tenant retention on a range of properties including residential housing and Class A, B, and C office space, as well as industrial,
manufacturing, retail, and warehousing facilities. We also intend to provide our clients with real estate consulting services, including
market analysis and modeling, market forecasts, lease and asset management, site selection, feasibility studies, sales and exit strategies,
strategic planning, organizational design, capital management, and research services. We intend to commence operations in the Las Vegas,
Nevada area due to the significant demand for real estate management services there and the proximity of our management team to that
city. 

We
were only incorporated on March 24, 2021, and have not commenced pursuing our business plan because we have been focused on raising the
initial capital to fund our business operations. From our incorporation on March 24, 2021, to July 31, 2023, we have incurred an accumulated
deficit of 86,779. To date, we have raised an aggregate of 83,400 through the sale of our common stock. Proceeds from these sales were
used to fund the filing of our registration statement and will be used for working capital. Further losses are anticipated in the development
of our business. As a result, our auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Anticipated
Services 

We
intend to provide clients with two principal types of services: (1) property management; and (2) property consulting. 

Property
Management Services 

As
property managers, the services that we intend to provide to owners of residential, commercial, and industrial properties include: 

completing
 an initial evaluation of properties and working with the owners to determine a target rental or lease rate; 

gathering
 comparable rental and lease rates in the area of the properties; 

reviewing
 the properties to determine if any repairs or upgrades should be recommended to the owners to increase rental or lease value; 

1 

gathering
 detailed information regarding the features of the properties, including interior and exterior photographs; 

discussing
 with the owners the policies that they would like to implement with respect to the rental or lease arrangements (e.g., acceptability
 of pets in a residential property; acceptable uses for commercial and industrial properties); 

marketing
 the properties for rent or lease by creating advertisements in various media including online, print, on-site signage, and fliers
 depending on the suitability of each medium for the type of property involved; 

answering
 potential tenant and lessee inquiries; meeting with them to view properties; and collecting applications and deposits; 

performing
 background and credit checks on prospective tenants and lessees; 

communicating
 with the property owners regarding prospective tenants and lessees; 

preparing
 and overseeing the execution of lease agreements; 

performing
 move-in inspections with tenants and lessees and having them execute a report verifying the condition of the property prior
 to the lease commencement date; 

collecting
 security deposits, rents, and lease payments; 

pursuing
 late payments and fees; 

where
 necessary, preparing the necessary paperwork to evict or commence an unlawful detainer action; 

performing
 periodic property inspections and providing the results of each inspection to the owner if there are concerns regarding the
 condition of the property; 

providing
 accounting services to document and record cash inflows and outflows, as well as related invoices, receipts, and payment information; 

preparing
 monthly cash flow statements and annual reports of financial results including required tax documents for the owners; 

overseeing
 maintenance and repairs on properties; and 

managing
 tenant and lessee move-out including inspections, damage assessment, and damage deposit returns. 

We
intend to generate revenue by charging owners a set monthly fee for our property management services, which will usually be based on
a percentage of the revenue that a rented or leased property generates. Such fees will vary depending on the type of property involved,
the amount of work that we will have to perform, and the rates that competitors charge for similar services. 

Property
Consulting Services 

As
property consultants, the services that we intend to provide include: 

preparing
 plans of action and evaluation for clients considering real estate acquisitions and development; 

2 

interpreting
 relevant real estate market data concerning price, yield, market stability, investment risks and trends, regulation, and economic
 influences; 

searching
 public records for transactions such as sales, leases, and assessments; 

computing
 property values while considering factors such as depreciation, replacement cost, comparable properties, and income potential; 

obtaining
 county land values and sales information in support of value assessments; 

checking
 building codes and zoning bylaws that may impact appraisal and development; 

estimating
 building replacement costs using building valuation manuals and professional cost estimators; 

inspecting
 properties to evaluate construction, condition, features, and functional design; 

evaluating
 land and neighborhoods where properties are situated including assessing locations, trends, and pending changes that could influence
 present and developed land value; 

providing
 market analysis and modelling for properties, as well as market forecasts and research; and 

providing
 advice on site selection, feasibility studies, sales and exit strategies, strategic planning, organizational design, and capital
 management. 

We
intend to generate revenue by charging owners either an hourly rate for our services or a set price for certain service that we reach
through negotiation with the clients. Initially, two of our directors, Gregory Navone, and James C. Shaw will provide these services
to clients. As our operations expand, we will need to retain additional staff in order to provide all of the above-noted services. 

Demand
for Property Management and Consulting Services 

According
to the University of Nevada Las Vegas Center for Business and Economic Research s 2019 report, the population of Clark
County in which Las Vegas is situated is expected to grow from 2,284,616 residents in 2018 to approximately 2,719,000 residents in 2030,
which represents a population increase of about 19 within that time frame. Cumming Corporation, an international construction management
company that provides forecasts regarding construction trends in various jurisdictions, projects that the residential construction will
increase in 2021 by almost 30 with multi-family rather than single-family residences driving this growth. However, the firm foresees
that demand will outpace supply due to labor and supply chain constraints. These trends will likely increase demand for residential,
commercial, and industrial real estate in the area, as well as increase demand for property management and consulting services. 

Marketing
Strategy 

While
we intend to offer our services to all sectors of the property management and consulting markets, we will initially focus on commercial
real and multi-unit residential estate given our president s experience in developing and operating shopping centers and apartment
buildings in Las Vegas. We believe that we will be able to charge higher rates for our services in these sectors because they tend to
generate relatively higher profit margins for owners and often require significant professional management and advice due to the large
scale of construction and operations. 

In
order to reach our target market sectors, we intend to rely upon the real estate and other business relationships that our directors
have established in the Las Vegas area and also focus our marketing efforts on our Internet presence, electronic brochures, and as our
business develops, print media advertising. We believe that social media tools are critically important to building our brand and awareness
of our business and will focus on online video advertising, client testimonials, and virtual tours of available properties that we manage.
We also intend to select and place advertising on those social media platforms that will be effective in reaching our target clients. 

3 

Competition 

The
real estate management sector, including real estate consulting, is extremely fragmented and competitive. The sector includes large entities
that provide services nationally, such as Greystar Real Estate Partners Lincoln Property Company, and CRBE Group, as well as real estate
investment trusts and real estate developers that have in-house real estate management. There are also many well-established residential,
commercial, and industrial property management companies that solely focus on the Las Vegas area. 

Since
the principal competitive factors in providing property management services are pricing, reputation, and quality of service, the fact
that most of our competitors have greater financial resources, enjoy greater economies of scale, and have established reputations will
make it more difficult for us to gain market share. We also expect to continue to face competition from new market entrants. We may be
unable to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
and results of operations. 

Government
Regulation 

Nevada
State Licensing Requirements 

Under
Nevada law, property management is considered to be a real estate activity requiring a real estate broker s license. In order to
lease, rent, list, collect rents, procure prospects, or negotiate, assist, or offer to perform any of those acts, he or she needs either
a salesperson s or broker s license. In addition, he or she must obtain a property manager permit. No broker s license
is required if the property manager does not engage in leasing activities, or if they are strictly on-site managers. Currently, only
Gregory Navone, our president, has a real estate broker s license in Nevada. He intends to apply for a property manager permit.
In order to obtain a Nevada property management permit, a person must have a Nevada real estate license, attend an accredited 24-hour
property management pre-permit course, and pass the Nevada property management state examination within one year of the date of application. 

To
obtain a license as a real estate salesperson in Nevada, one must complete 90 hours or six semester units of instruction in real estate
principles, practices, and law that is given by an approved provider. Additionally, applicants must show proof of passing the national
and Nevada state exam within one year of the application date. To obtain a license as a real estate broker in Nevada, a person must complete
64 semester units of instruction. The applicant must have been actively engaged as a full-time licensed real estate broker or salesman
for at least two of the four years immediately prior to the issuance of a Nevada broker license and must pass the national and Nevada
state exam within one year of the application date. 

Nevada
Revised Statute NRS 645 outlines various laws that apply to real estate brokers and salespersons. Among the duties that
it imposes on those with a real estate license in Nevada include obligations to: 

1 
 Not
 deal with any party to a real estate transaction in a manner which is deceitful, fraudulent or dishonest; 

2 
 Exercise
 reasonable skill and care with respect to all parties to the real estate transaction; 

3 
 Disclose
 to each party to the real estate transaction as soon as practicable (a) any material and relevant facts, data or information
 which licensee knows, or with reasonable care and diligence the licensee should know, about the property; and (b) each source from
 which licensee will receive compensation. 

4 
 Abide
 by all other duties, responsibilities and obligations required of the licensee in law or regulations; 

5 
 Exercise
 reasonable skill and care to carry out the terms of the brokerage agreement and the licensee s duties in the brokerage
 agreement; 

4 

6

 or termination of the brokerage agreement, unless licensee is required to do so by court order or the client gives written permission; 

7 
 Seek
 a sale, purchase, option, rental or lease of real property at the price and terms stated in the brokerage agreement or at a
 price acceptable to the client; 

8 
 Present
 all offers made to, or by the client as soon as practicable, unless the client chooses to waive the duty of the licensee to
 present all offers and signs a waiver of the duty on a form prescribed by the Nevada Real Estate Division; 

9 
 Disclose
 to the client material facts of which the licensee has knowledge concerning the real estate transaction; 

10 
 Advise
 the client to obtain advice from an expert relating to matters which are beyond the expertise of the licensee; and 

11 
 Account
 to the client for all money and property the licensee receives in which the client may have an interest. 

Property
Management 

NRS
645 also mandates that a property management agreement must include: 

1 
 The
 term of the agreement and, if the agreement is subject to renewal, provisions clearly setting forth the circumstances under
 which the agreement may be renewed and the term of each such renewal; 

2 
 A
 provision for the retention and disposition of deposits of the tenants of the property during the term of the agreement and,
 if the agreement is subject to renewal, during the term of each such renewal; 

3 
 The
 fee or compensation to be paid to the broker; 

4 
 The
 extent to which the broker may act as the agent of the client; 

5 
 If
 the agreement is subject to cancellation, provisions clearly setting forth the circumstances under which the agreement may be
 cancelled. The agreement may authorize the broker or the client, or both, to cancel the agreement with cause or without cause, or
 both, under the circumstances set forth in the agreement; and 

6 
 If
 the broker intends to provide asset management services for the client, a provision indicating the extent to which the broker
 will provide those services. 

Subsidiaries 

We
do not have any subsidiaries. 

Patents
and Trademarks 

We
do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patents or trademarks. 

Governmental
and Industry Regulations 

We

have not spent any funds on research and development activities to date. 

Compliance
with Environmental Laws 

Our
current operations are not subject to any environmental laws.

We
do not own or rent facilities of any kind. We plan to conduct our operations from the office of our president until we are in a position
to commence and expand operations.

Our
shares of common stock do not trade on any recognized stock exchange or quotation system. We intend to retain a market maker that will

As
of November 3, 2023, there were approximately 37 beneficial owners of record of our common stock. 

Holders
of common stock are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefore
and, in the event of liquidation, to share pro rata in any distribution of our assets after payment of liabilities. The Board of Directors
is not obligated to declare a dividend. We have not paid any dividends and we do not have any current plans to pay any dividends.

Item
6. Selected Financial Data. 

Not

Item
7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of our Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. 

Introduction 

We
were incorporated on March 24, 2021 under the laws of the State of Wyoming. 

Results
of Operations for the Year Ended July 31, 2023. 

From
August 1, 2022 to our fiscal year end of July 31, 2023, we did not earn any revenue. From August 1, 2022 to our fiscal year end of July
31, 2023, we incurred net loss of 7,651 consisting entirely of general and administrative fees. 

We
have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to complete our proposed business plan. For these
reasons our auditors believe that there is substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern. 

Our
financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments
relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable
to continue in operation. 

7 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of July 31, 2023, our current assets of 15,758 consisted of 758 in cash and 15,000 in prepayments and deposits and our total liabilities
were 19,138, which consisted entirely of accounts payable and accrued liabilities. We expect we will require additional capital to meet
our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other methods, the sale of equity or debt
securities. 

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities 

We
have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. From August 1, 2022 to July 31, 2023, net cash used in operating activities
was 14,037 consisting of our net loss for the period of 7,651 and a decrease of accounts payable of 6,386. 

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities 

From
August 1, 2021 to July 31, 2023, we have not had any cash flows from investing activities. 

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities 

We
have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue exploration activities. For these reasons,
there is substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern. 

Since
our incorporation, we have financed our operations through proceeds from the sale of our common stock. We expect to finance operations
through the sale of equity for the foreseeable future, as we do not receive significant revenue from our business operations. There is
no guarantee that we will be successful in arranging financing on acceptable terms. 

Our
ability to raise additional capital is affected by trends and uncertainties beyond our control. We do not currently have any arrangements
for financing and we may not be able to find such financing if required. Obtaining additional financing would be subject to a number
of factors, including investor sentiment. Market factors may make the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional financing unavailable
to us. 

Our
auditors are of the opinion that our continuation as a going concern is in doubt. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon
continued financial support from our shareholders and other related parties. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of the date of this annual report, we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current
or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue
recognition, inventories, adequacy of allowances for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-lived assets and goodwill, income taxes, litigation
and warranties. We base its estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe
are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. The policies discussed below are considered by management
to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent
degree of uncertainty. Actual results may differ from those estimates. 

8 

Property
and Equipment 

Property
and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment are accounted for by accelerated methods over the following
estimated useful lives: 

Evaluation
of Long-Lived Assets 

We
review property and equipment for potential impairment whenever significant events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
value may not be recoverable in accordance with the guidance in ASC 360-15-35 Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets .
An impairment exists when the carrying amount of the long-lived assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount
of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual
disposition of the asset. If an impairment exists, the resulting write-down would be the difference between the fair market value of
the long-lived asset and the related net book value. 

Income
Taxes 

Deferred
income tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases
of assets and liabilities using the statutory marginal income tax rate in effect for the years in which the differences are expected
to reverse. Deferred income tax expenses or credits are based on the changes in the deferred income tax assets or liabilities from period
to period. A valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is required if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce
the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

To
the shareholders and the board of directors of Galaxy Enterprises Inc.. 

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. 

Opinion
on the financial statements. 

I
have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Galaxy Enterprises Inc. and the related statements of income, stockholders equity, cash
flows, including the related notes and any related schedules for the years ended July 31, 2023. In my opinion the financial statements
present fairly in all material respects the financial position of the company as of July 31, 2023 and the results of its operations and
its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Going
concern matters. 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in
Note 2 to the financial statements, the company has incurred losses, and has an accumulated deficit which raises substantial doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans concerning these matters are also described in Note 2.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 

Basis
for opinion. 

These
financial statements are the responsibility of the company s management. My responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
statements based on my audit. I am a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the US federal securities laws
and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. I conducted my audit in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. My audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. I believe my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion. 

Critical
audit matters. 

Critical
audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved my especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. I have determined that there are no critical audit matters
to report. 

The
company is not required to have, nor was I engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of
my audit, I am required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, I express no such opinion.

and operating cash outflows of as of July 31, 2023. Further losses are anticipated in the development
of its business raising substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period no less than
12 months from the date of this report. In order to remain in business, the Company will need to raise capital in the next twelve
months. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future
and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when
they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and proceeds from
its public offering. The Company has no written or verbal commitments from shareholders, director or officer to provide the Company with
any form of cash advances, loans or other sources of liquidity to meet its working capital needs. The accompanying financial statements
do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts
and classifications of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.

AS
topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the
inputs in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring
fair value are observable in the market. 

These
tiers include: 

Level
 1: 
 Defined
 as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; 
 
 Level
 2: 
 Defined
 as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; 
 
 Level
 3: 
 Defined
 as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 

The
Company has adopted FASB ASC 825, Financial Instruments, which allows companies to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and
certain other items at fair value that are not required to be measured at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option
for any eligible financial instruments.

As
of July 31, 2023, there were no issued and outstanding stock options or warrants. 

that may be available to reduce future years taxable income in varying amounts
through 2040. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements,
as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred
tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards. 

The
ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which
those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected
future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on consideration of these items, management
has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the realization of the deferred income tax asset balances to warrant the application
of a full valuation allowance as of July 31, 2023. All tax years since inception remains open for examination by taxing authorities.

Item
9A. Controls and Procedures. 

As
supervised by our board of directors and our principal executive and principal financial officer, management has established a system
of disclosure, controls and procedures and has evaluated the effectiveness of that system. The system and its evaluation are reported
on in the below Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our principal executive and financial
officer has concluded that our disclosure, controls and procedures (as defined in Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of July 31, 2023, were not effective, based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph
(b) of Rule 13a-15. 

Management s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. 

Management
assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2023. We carried out this assessment using the
criteria of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. 

B.
Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. In order to evaluate the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management has conducted an assessment,
including testing, using the criteria in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission COSO ). 

Our
system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. 

10 

Based
on our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting
were not effective as of July 31, 2023 and were subject to material weaknesses. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. We have identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting
using the criteria established in the COSO: 

1 
 Failing
 to have an audit committee or other independent committee that is independent of management to assess internal control over financial
 reporting; and 

2 
 Failing
 to have a director that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5) (ii) of Regulation S-K. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm, pursuant to rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report. Management concluded
in this assessment that as of July 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. 

There
have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d15(f) under the
Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of our 2019 fiscal year that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

percent (5 of the Company s equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Officers, directors and greater than ten percent shareholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company
with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based on its review of the copies of such forms received by it, the Company believes
that during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, all such filing requirements applicable to its officers and directors were complied
with, except that our three directors were required to file a Form 3 with respect to their shareholdings.

We
have not adopted a Code of Ethics that governs the conduct of our officer.
