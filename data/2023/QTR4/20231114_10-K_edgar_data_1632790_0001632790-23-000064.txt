This section also may refer to brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names of other companies and organizations, and these brand names, trademarks, service marks and trade names are the property of their respective owners. 
 
 Unless indicated otherwise, the information concerning our industry contained in this Annual Report is based on Energizer s general knowledge of and expectations concerning the industry.

 Narrative Description of the Business 
 
 Our Products 
 
 Energizer offers household batteries including primary, rechargeable, specialty and hearing aid using many technologies including lithium, alkaline, carbon zinc, nickel metal hydride, zinc air, and silver oxide. These products are sold globally under the Energizer, Eveready and Rayovac brands, including hearing aid batteries, and the Varta brand in Latin America and Asia Pacific. Our portfolio spans the performance, premium and price segments. 
 
 In addition, we offer auto care products in the appearance, fragrance, performance, and air conditioning recharge product categories. The appearance and fragrance categories include protectants, wipes, tire and wheel care products, glass cleaners, leather care products, air fresheners and washes designed to clean, shine, refresh, disinfect and protect interior and exterior automobile surfaces under the brand names Armor All , Nu Finish , Refresh Your Car! , LEXOL , Eagle One , California Scents , Driven , Bahama Co , Carnu , Grand Prix , Kit and Tempo . 
 
 The performance product category includes STP -branded fuel and oil additives, functional fluids and other performance chemical products that benefit from a rich heritage in the car enthusiast and racing scenes, characterized by a commitment to technology, performance and motor sports partnerships for over 60 years. The brand equity of STP also provides for attractive licensing opportunities that augment our presence in our core performance categories. 
 
 The air conditioning recharge product category includes do-it-yourself automotive air conditioning recharge products led by the A/C PRO brand name, along with other refrigerant and recharge kits, sealants and accessories. 
 4 

In addition, we offer an extensive line of lighting products designed to meet a variety of consumer needs. We distribute, and market lighting products including handheld, headlights, lanterns, and area lights. In addition to the Energizer, Eveready and Rayovac brands, we market our flashlights under the Hard Case , Dolphin , and WeatherReady sub-brands. In addition to batteries and portable lights, Energizer licenses the Energizer, Eveready and Rayovac brands to companies developing consumer solutions in solar, automotive batteries, portable power for critical devices (like smart phones), generators, power tools, household light bulbs and other lighting products. 
 
 Additional information about our products can be found in MD A in Part II, Item 7 of this Report, and Note 3, Revenue, to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Our Industry 
 
 We are a branded manufacturing and distribution company that markets and sells in the battery, auto care and portable lights categories. These categories are highly competitive, both in the U.S. and on a global basis. We invest in our brands and innovation to meet the needs of consumers, and with our large global footprint, we both manufacture and source our products. Competition within our categories is based upon brand perceptions, product performance, price, retail execution and customer service. Key drivers of the battery business are device usage, consumer demographics and disasters and key drivers for the auto care business are size and age of car parc and miles driven. Competition in this category remains aggressive in the U.S. and other markets and could continue to put additional pressure on our results going forward, particularly as consumers shift consumption between channels such as e-commerce and discounters. 
 
 Sales and Distribution 
 
 We distribute our products to consumers through numerous retail locations worldwide, including mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs, food, drug and convenience stores, electronics specialty stores and department stores, hardware and automotive centers, e-commerce and military stores. Although a large percentage of our sales are attributable to a relatively small number of retail customers, in fiscal year 2023, only Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounted for ten percent or more (14.2 of the Company's annual sales. 
 
 Our products are marketed primarily through a direct sales force, but also through exclusive and non-exclusive distributors and wholesalers. Our products are sold through both modern and traditional trade. Modern trade, which is most prevalent in North America, Western Europe, and more developed economies throughout the world, generally refers to sales through large retailers with nationally or regionally recognized brands. Traditional trade, which is more common in developing markets in Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa, generally refers to sales by wholesalers or small retailers who may not have a national or regional presence. 
 
 Additional information can be found in the MD A and Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 3, Revenue, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 
 
 The principal raw materials used by Energizer in the production of batteries and lighting products include electrolytic manganese dioxide, zinc, silver, nickel, lithium, graphite, steel, plastic, brass wire, and potassium hydroxide. The principal raw material used by auto care is refrigerant R-134a, plastic, silicone, steel and aluminum. The prices and availability of these raw materials have fluctuated over time. We believe that adequate supplies of most raw materials and component parts required for all of our operations are available at the present time, although we cannot predict their future availability or prices. Our raw materials and component parts are generally available from a number of different sources, and are susceptible to currency fluctuations and price fluctuations due to supply and demand, transportation, government regulations, price controls, tariffs, economic climate, or other unforeseen circumstances like force majeure. We continue to work to qualify additional sources to ensure continuity and resiliency of supply for these items. We believe we have extensive experience in purchasing raw materials in the commodity markets. From time to time, our management has purchased materials or entered into forward commitments for raw materials to assure supply and to protect margins on anticipated sales volume. 
 
 5 

Our Trademarks, Patents and Technology 
 
 Our ability to compete effectively in the battery, auto care and portable lights categories depends, in part, on our ability to protect our brands and maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies and manufacturing processes through a combination of trademark, patent and trade secret protection. We own thousands of Energizer, Rayovac, and Eveready trademarks globally, and license Varta trademarks, which we consider to be of substantial importance and which are used individually or in conjunction with other sub-brand names. The number of Energizer, Rayovac, Eveready, Energizer Bunny, and Mr. Energizer trademarks, including related designs, slogans and sub-brands, is currently over 2,800 worldwide. 
 
 In our auto care business, we also have the Refresh Your Car!, California Scents, Driven, Bahama Co., LEXOL, Eagle One, Armor All, STP, Tuff Stuff, Kent Car Care, A/C Pro and the Nu Finish trademarks, and we recently expanded our portfolio in Latin America to add the Carnu, Grand Prix, Kit and Tempo trademarks. The number of trademarks making up the total of the auto care trademark portfolio globally, including related designs, slogans, and sub-brands, is nearly 1,900 worldwide. 
 
 We also own a number of patents, patent applications and other technology that relate primarily to battery, automotive fragrance, performance and appearance products and portable lights, which we believe are significant to our business. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 Sales and operating profit for our business tends to be seasonal, with increased purchases by consumers and increases in retailer inventories occurring for batteries during our fiscal first quarter and for automotive fragrance, appearance, performance and air conditioning recharge products during our fiscal second and third quarters. In addition, natural disasters such as hurricanes can create conditions that drive short-term increases in the need for portable power and lighting products and thereby increase our battery and flashlight sales. As a result of this seasonality, our inventory and working capital needs fluctuate throughout the year. 
 
 Human Capital Resources 
 
 Purpose and Culture 
 
 Energizer is driven by our purpose to responsibly create products to make lives easier and more enjoyable, and we take very seriously our responsibility to foster a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment where people feel a sense of belonging. We are committed to providing fulfilling careers and development opportunities for our colleagues at all levels and supporting their well-being at work and at home. By living our culture of winning together, while serving each other, with a willingness to act boldly, all while doing right, we drive an atmosphere where colleagues can feel proud to work for Energizer. Our culture is the foundation for everything we do, and it is essential to fulfilling our mission of being the leader in our categories by better serving consumers and customers: 
 
 We Win Together . We relentlessly pursue our goals. We celebrate and move to the next challenge. We act with urgency because windows of opportunity close quickly. We are focused on results. 
 While Serving Each Other . We care for others success as much as we do our own. We challenge respectfully to drive better outcomes and work collectively across functions, levels and geographies to achieve our goals. All for one, one for all. 
 With A Willingness to Act Boldly . We push forward rather than leaning back. We take chances, have a bias for action and go all in to achieve our goals. Even if we fail, we fail together. We are transparent, we learn from it, and we are better for it. We are fearlessly determined. 
 All While Doing Right . We bring out the best in each other to bring the best to our consumers and customers. We are vulnerable and trust each other with our imperfections. By being inclusive and open, our diverse perspectives amplify what we can achieve. Doing the right thing is all we know.

 As of September 30, 2023, we had approximately 5,080 employees located across 30 countries, including approximately 1,950 employees based in North America, 1,725 employees in Asia Pacific, 890 employees in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and 515 employees in Latin America. Approximately 300 employees are unionized, primarily at our Fennimore, Wisconsin; Portage, Wisconsin; and Marietta, Ohio, facilities. We consider our employee relations to be good. 
 
 6 

Governance 
 
 Energizer believes that strong governance principles, policies, and practices contribute to better results for our shareholders. We are proud to have a diverse and independent Board of Directors with the skills, experience and perspectives to help chart the course of our global company. 
 
 The Human Capital Committee oversees company policies and practices related to human capital management, including those related to our culture, diversity and inclusion efforts, and rewards and compensation programs. Under the leadership of our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Human Capital Officer is responsible for developing and executing key aspects of our human capital strategy, including the attraction, development, retention, and engagement of talent to deliver on the company s strategy and the design of competitive compensation and employee benefit programs. 
 
 Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging 
 
 Diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging DEIB is a business imperative that requires active engagement from all leaders and colleagues. We strive to foster an inclusive and diverse workplace culture where colleagues feel a sense of belonging, feel listened to, are included in discussions, and are valued for their contributions. 
 
 In fiscal 2023, we continued to focus on the following strategic DEIB priorities: 
 
 Community : Promoting a workplace where all colleagues feel safe to express their perspectives and feel they belong to our team; 
 Learning : Building colleague awareness and understanding to produce respectful and inclusive workplace behaviors and actions; and 
 Talent : Embracing diversity to attract, recruit, develop, and retain top talent. 
 
 Our recruitment strategies are designed to ensure a diverse pipeline of candidates to meet the needs of our business today and in the future. Energizer has taken steps to enhance its talent acquisition process across the organization, including by implementing diversity training for recruiters, interview skills training for colleagues who are new to the interview process, and processes to improve our candidate attraction, selection, and onboarding so we can welcome diverse colleagues to our company. We continually assess our talent guidelines and decisions as part of our efforts to ensure fair and objective hiring practices. 
 
 Energizer is proud to have three employee resource groups the Women s Leadership Network, the African Ancestry Leadership Group, and Mosaic (the Asian-American Ancestry Group) that help increase the visibility and advancement of diverse colleagues. By embracing our colleagues diverse cultures, experiences, and ways of thinking, we believe we will deliver better business results and have a more engaged workforce. 
 
 Talent Development and Training 
 
 Engaged, driven and productive colleagues are essential to achieving growth. All Energizer colleagues participate in annual training focused on topics related to ethics, compliance, diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging. 
 
 For salaried colleagues, we offer a catalog featuring in excess of 2,000 online courses from IT skills to business acumen and leadership skills, along with an online competency model library and supporting training resources. Specific skills-based training is provided to colleagues within their function so they can understand and master necessary job skills and requirements and have access to developmental opportunities. We also encourage career development through individual development planning, formal mentoring programs, team effectiveness workshops, project and change management training, and leadership development programs. 
 
 For hourly colleagues, we conduct annual safety, health, and environmental training as well as equipment and other job-relevant training. Colleagues are encouraged to communicate their career interests to their manager and have access to our career center to view available positions. 
 
 Compensation and Benefits 
 
 Our primary compensation strategy is to pay for performance on both a long-term and annual basis, which helps drive a mindset of accountability and productivity and aligns the interests of our colleagues with our shareholders. Our compensation guiding principles are to structure compensation that is simple, aligned and balanced. We believe our compensation guiding principles are strongly aligned with our corporate strategic priorities and our vision for shareholder value creation. 
 
 7 

We deliver market-competitive total rewards packages for our colleagues, which vary based on market practices. As part of our commitment to fair pay, we strive to be externally competitive while keeping in mind internal equity across our organization. Pay for performance is our fundamental reward philosophy. We reward and recognize both individual and team results relative to our business goals and commitment to shareholders, as well as behaviors that align with our culture statement. We conduct global pay equity assessments and compensation reviews. We strive to reduce unconscious biases and structural barriers in our hiring practices, performance reviews, promotional guidelines and leadership opportunities that may contribute to pay inequities. 
 
 Workplace Safety 
 
 In an effort to ensure our colleagues have a safe workplace, Energizer maintains a global safety, health, and environmental SHE policy. Because providing products and services to our customers with zero harm to people and the environment is our goal, we require all colleagues and contractors at our plants and manufacturing facilities to understand and follow our global SHE policy, and we retrain them on this policy annually. Each facility also maintains additional safety policies, measures and procedures specific to its individual needs. In addition, our facilities incorporate the usage of noise and air permits, thus contributing to the decrease of air pollution and creating a safer, more comfortable environment for all colleagues. Our occupational health and safety management system is aimed at addressing three key components of safety: 
 
 Identifying the root cause of safety hazards in our operations; 
 Assessing risks associated with all hazards or conditions identified; and 
 Mitigating risks associated with known hazards and conditions. 
 
 The program establishes minimum requirements for enterprise-wide safety, environmental and Department of Transportation loss-prevention activities. It contributes to our compliance with applicable safety and environmental-related laws, rules and regulations. It aligns with national and international SHE standards such as American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z-10 and ISO 45001 and provides a framework for 16 SHE elements. 
 
 Community 
 
 Energizer believes in supporting the communities where we live, work and play. Many of our colleagues are highly active with charities of their own choosing, and the Energizer Giving Foundation enables them to make a greater difference by matching their contributions dollar-for-dollar. Energizer also supports Feed the Children and disaster relief efforts through our partnership with the Red Cross. Since 2016, Energizer has donat ed more than 18 million batt eries and portable lighting products in North America alone. 
 
 The World Health Organization celebrates World Hearing Day every March to raise awareness of hearing loss, encourage individuals to recognize the signs of hearing loss in themselves or loved ones and advocate for audiology checkups. In support of this effort, Rayovac promotes an online hub of information and articles for consumers to raise awareness of the seriousness and importance of hearing loss, and help people to recognize their own hearing loss, or recognize the symptoms in a loved one prompting them to get a checkup. 
 
 Energizer takes seriously our responsibility to support communities in need during times of crisis and disaster. Throughout the last year, we responded to hurricanes and wildfires across the globe with product donations. 
 
 Relevant Company Policies 
 
 Energizer s policies in support of the topics discussed in this section, including the Equal Employment Opportunity Policy, Social Policy (Human Rights and Labor Rights), and Safety, Health, and Environmental Policy, can be found in the Policies section of the Energizer Holdings, Inc. website. 
 
 Governmental Regulations and Environmental Matters 
 
 Our operations, including the manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution, advertising and sale of our products, are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including those intended to protect public health and the environment. In the U.S. many of our products are regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, and by the Federal Trade Commission with respect to advertising. Similar regulations have been adopted by authorities in foreign countries where we sell our products, and by state and local authorities in the U.S. We are also subject to extended producer responsibility (EPR) fees regarding the recycling of batteries and packaging; regulations regarding transportation, storage or use of certain chemicals to protect the environment; and regulations in other related areas, such as sustainability, including the European Union Batteries Regulation and updates to EU REACH, the EU Detergents Regulation, the EU General Product Safety Regulation, and Classification, Labeling, and Packaging (CLP) laws. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, 
 8 

approvals and certificates from various federal, foreign, state and local governmental authorities. 
 
 In recent years, refrigerants such as R-134a, which is a critical component of our auto care business aftermarket A/C products, have become the subject of regulatory focus due to their potential to contribute to global warming. The EU has passed regulations that essentially phased out of R-134a in automotive cooling systems in new vehicles by 2017. Canada has also implemented similar regulations, phasing into effect beginning in 2021. The United States passed the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act (AIM Act) in 2020, which also regulates refrigerants, and individual states are also regulating the sale and distribution of products containing R-134a and state limitations on PFAs often include blanket restrictions on refrigerants. In addition, regulations may also be enacted governing the packing, use and disposal of our auto care business' products containing refrigerants. 
 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits bribery of public officials to obtain or retain business in foreign jurisdictions and requires us to keep accurate books and records and to maintain internal accounting controls to detect and prevent bribery and to ensure that transactions are properly authorized. We are also subject to similar or even more restrictive anti-corruption laws imposed by the governments of other countries where we do business, including the UK Bribery Act of 2010 and the Brazil Clean Company Act. We make sales and operate in countries known to experience corruption that are rated as high-risk nations. Our business activities in such countries create the risk of unauthorized conduct by one or more of our employees, customs brokers, freight forwarders, or distributors that could be in violation of various laws including the FCPA or similar local regulations. 
 
 Our business is subject to competition laws in the various jurisdictions where we operate, including the Sherman Antitrust Act and related federal and state antitrust laws in the U.S. These laws and regulations generally prohibit competitors from fixing prices, boycotting competitors, or engaging in other conduct that unreasonably restrains competition. In many jurisdictions, compliance with these competition laws is of special importance to us, and our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities, due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions. 
 
 The Company is also required to comply with increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal data in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other consumer, customer, vendor or employee data. Such privacy and data protection laws and regulations, including with respect to the European Union's GDPR, the Brazilian Data Protection Law, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), and the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations, are continuously developing and evolving and there is significant uncertainty with respect to how compliance with these laws and regulations may evolve and the costs and complexity of future compliance. 
 
 We also must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, recycling of batteries and packaging, the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances, chemicals in products and product safety. We are currently involved in or have potential liability with respect to the remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of our current and former manufacturing facilities. In addition, some of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many years and, over that time, some of those facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may now be considered hazardous. It is possible that those sites, as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to whom we have sent waste, may be identified and become the subject of remediation. We could also become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future, whether as a result of new laws and regulations or otherwise, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 For additional information on the laws and regulations that apply to our business, see MD A and Note 20, Environmental and Regulatory, to our Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of the risks associated with these laws and regulations, see Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors."

Item 1A. Risk Factors . 
 In the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in our industry and others of which are more specific to our own businesses. The discussion below addresses the material factors, of 
 9 

which we are currently aware, that could affect, and in certain cases have affected, our businesses, results of operations and financial condition and make an investment in the Company speculative or risky. 
 
 Additional factors that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition are discussed in Forward-Looking Statements in MD A. However, other factors not discussed below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could also adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that we may face. 
 
 Any risk factor described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any of our other SEC filings could by itself, or together with other factors, materially adversely affect our liquidity, competitive position, business, reputation, results of operations, capital position or financial condition, including by materially increasing our expenses or decreasing our revenues, which could result in material losses. Investors should not interpret the disclosure of a risk to imply that the risk has not already materialized. 
 
 Economic, Competitive and Industry Risks 
 
 Global economic and financial market conditions beyond our control might materially and negatively impact us. 
 
 General economic factors beyond our control could adversely affect our business and results of operations. These factors include, but are not limited to, recent supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, wage pressures, rising inflation and potential economic slowdown or growing recession risk, as well as input costs including fuel and energy costs (for example, the price of gasoline), foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and other matters that influence consumer spending and preferences. 
 
 In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical instability, including the conflict in Ukraine, as well as other global events have significantly increased global macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility. In response to unfavorable economic conditions, there has been and, in the future, could be a reduction in discretionary spending, which may lead to reduced net sales or cause a shift in our product mix from higher-margin to lower-margin product offerings or a shift of purchasing patterns to lower cost options such as private label brands sold by retail chains or price brands. This shift could drive the market towards lower margin products or force us to reduce prices for our products in order to compete. Similarly, our retailer customers could reduce their inventories, shift to different products or require us to lower our prices to retain the shelf placement of our products. Conversely, rapid increases in demand due to improving economic conditions could lead to supply chain challenges. 
 
 Global markets continued to face threats and uncertainty during fiscal year 2023. Uncertain economic and financial market conditions may also adversely affect the financial condition of our customers, suppliers and other business partners. Any significant decrease in customers purchases of our products or our inability to collect accounts receivable resulting from an adverse impact of the global markets on customers financial condition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, disruptions in financial markets could reduce our access to debt and equity capital markets, negatively affecting our ability to implement our business strategy. 
 
 Competition in our product categories might hinder our ability to execute our business strategy, achieve profitability, or maintain relationships with existing customers. 
 
 We face intense competition from consumer product companies both in the U.S. and in global markets. Most of our products compete with other widely advertised, promoted and merchandised brands within each product category. The categories in which we operate are mature and highly competitive, with a mix of large, small, and private label manufacturers competing for consumer acceptance, limited retail shelf space and e-commerce opportunities. Because of the highly competitive environment in which we operate, our customers, including online retailers, frequently seek to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms, resulting in either a reduction of our margins or the loss of distribution to lower-cost competitors. 
 
 Competition in our product categories is based upon brand perceptions, innovation, product performance, customer service and price. Our ability to compete effectively is, and in the future could be, affected by a number of factors, including: 
 
 Certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, research and development, and other resources and greater market share in certain segments than we do, which could provide them with greater scale and negotiating leverage with retailers and suppliers. These competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than we can. 
 10 

Our competitors may have lower production, sales and distribution costs, and higher profit margins. 
 Our competitors have obtained, and may in the future be able to obtain, exclusivity or sole source at particular retailers or favorable in-store placement. 
 We may lose market share to certain retailers, including club stores, grocery, dollar stores, mass merchandisers and internet-based retailers, which may offer private label brands that are typically sold at lower prices and compete with our products in certain categories. 
 
 Changes in the retail environment and consumer preferences could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our sales have historically been largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery, mass retail outlet, warehouse club and dollar store channels. Alternative retail channels, including hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and subscription services, have become more prevalent, and retailers are increasingly selling consumer products through such channels. In addition, alternative sales channels and business models, such as private label and store brands, direct-to-consumer brands and channels and discounter channels continue to evolve. In particular, the growing presence of, and increasing sales through, e-commerce retailers have affected, and may continue to affect, consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online) and market dynamics, including any pricing pressures for consumer goods as retailers face added costs to build their e-commerce capacity. Although we are engaged in e-commerce with respect to many of our products, if we are not successful in responding to these competitive factors, changing consumer preferences and market dynamics or expanding sales through evolving sales channels, especially e-commerce retailers, hard discounters and other alternative retail channels, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted. 
 
 We must successfully manage the demand, supply, and operational challenges brought about by any disease outbreak, including epidemics, pandemics, or similar widespread public health concerns. 
 
 Our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels, impulse purchases, the availability of our products to retailers and our ability to manufacture, store and distribute products to our customers and consumers in an effective and efficient manner. The fear of exposure to or actual effects of a disease outbreak or similar widespread public health concern, could negatively impact our overall business, financial position and financial results. These impacts may include, but are not limited to: 
 
 Significant reductions, shifts or fluctuations in demand for one or more of our products; 
 Inability to meet our customers needs due to disruptions in our manufacturing and supply chain arrangements caused by the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing and supply chain elements. In addition, we may incur higher costs for transportation, workforce and distribution capability in order to maintain the surety of supplying product to our customers; 
 Failure of third parties upon which we rely, including our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors and commercial banks, to meet their obligations to us in a timely manner and 
 Significant changes in the political and regulatory landscape in the markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products, which may include, but are not limited to, restrictions on international trade, governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or suspend our or our third-party partners' or customers' operating and/or manufacturing capabilities, including operations necessary for the production, distribution, sale, and support of our products, which could adversely impact our results. 
 
 Loss or impairment of the reputation of our Company or our leading brands or failure of our marketing plans could have an adverse effect on our business. 
 
 We depend on the continuing reputation and success of our brands. Maintaining a strong reputation with consumers, customers, the trade, suppliers and other third-party partners is critical to the success of our business. Negative publicity about us or our brands, including product safety, quality, efficacy, environmental impacts (including packaging, energy and water use, matters related to climate and waste management) and other sustainability or similar issues, whether real or perceived, could occur and could be widely and rapidly disseminated, including through the use of social media or network sites. Our operating results could be adversely affected if any of our brands suffers damage to its reputation due to real or perceived issues. Any damage to our brands could impair our ability to charge premium prices for our products, resulting in the reduction of our margins or losses of distribution to lower price competitors, or may require us to record impairments of intangible assets, including trademarks or goodwill, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 The success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or new product offerings do not improve, or have a negative impact on, our brands image or ability to attract and retain consumers. Additionally, if claims made in our marketing 
 11 

campaigns subject us to claims and litigation alleging false advertising, which is common in some categories in our industry, such claims and litigation could damage our brand or cause us to alter our marketing plans in ways that may materially and adversely affect sales, or result in the imposition of significant damages against us. In addition, our products could face quality or safety issues, which could result in our withdrawing or recalling the product from the marketplace and may lead to decreased demand for, and sales of, such products and harm the reputation of the related brands. We also license certain of our brands to third parties, and such licenses and partnerships may create additional exposure for those brands to product safety, quality, sustainability and other concerns. 
 
 Loss of any of our principal customers could significantly decrease our sales and profitability. 
 
 A large percentage of our sales are attributable to a relatively small number of retail customers, and we may continue to derive a significant portion of our future revenues from a small number of customers. Additionally, with the growing trend towards retailer consolidation, both in the U.S. and internationally, the rapid growth of e-commerce and the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers, we are increasingly dependent on certain retailers. As a result, changes in the strategies or demands of our largest customers, including a reduction in the number of brands they carry, a shift of shelf space to private label or competitors products or a decision to lower pricing of consumer products, including branded products, may harm our net sales or margins, and reduce our ability to offer new, innovative products to consumers. Furthermore, these large, consolidated companies could also exert additional competitive pressure on our other customers, which could in turn lead to similar demands on us. If we cease doing business with a significant customer or if we experience a significant reduction in net sales to a key customer, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from us at any time and for any reason. If we do not effectively respond to the demands of our customers, they could decrease their purchases from us, causing our net sales and net earnings to decline. 
 
 Our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation and changing consumer habits. 
 
 A large percentage of our revenues comes from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition. Achieving our business results depends, in part, on successfully developing, introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes. The successful development and introduction of new products requires retail and consumer acceptance and overcoming the reaction from competitors. New product introductions in categories where we have existing products will likely also reduce the sales of our existing products. Our investments in research and development may not result in successful products or innovation that will recover the costs of such investments. Our customers or consumers may not purchase our new products once introduced. Additionally, new products could require regulatory approval which may not be available or may require modification to the product which could impact the production process and the timely introduction of the products. Our competitors may introduce new or enhanced products that outperform ours, or develop manufacturing technology that permits them to manufacture at a lower cost relative to ours and sell at a lower price. If we fail to develop and launch successful new products or fail to reduce our cost structure to a competitive level, we may be unable to grow our business and compete successfully. 
 
 We must also successfully respond to technological advances made by, and intellectual property rights granted to, competitors. Failure to continually innovate, improve and respond to competitive moves and changing consumer habits could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our results. With respect to the battery category, we have been assessing volume and device trends over the last several years, and although baseline emerging device and demographic trends combined with the stabilization of the device universe lead us to believe the long term outlook for category volume will be flat to slightly positive, there is no assurance this trend will continue. An increasing number of devices are using built-in battery systems, such as rechargeable hearing aids, particularly in developed markets, leading to potential declining volume trend in the battery category. Additionally, there could be a negative impact on the demand for primary batteries and could put additional pressure on results going forward, both directly through reduced consumption and indirectly as manufacturers aggressively price and promote their products to seek to retain market share or gain battery shelf space. 
 
 Our business also depends on our ability to continue to manufacture our existing products to meet the applicable product performance claims. Any decline in these standards could result in the loss of business and negatively impact our performance and financial results. Finally, our ability to maintain favorable margins on our products requires us to manage our manufacturing and other production costs relative to our prices. We may not be able to increase our prices in response to production cost increases, which would decrease our profit margins and negatively impact our business and financial results. 
 
 12 

We have implemented price increases in the past and may implement price increases in the future, which may slow sales growth or create volume declines in the short term as customers and consumers adjust to these price increases. In addition, our competitors may or may not take competitive actions, which may lead to sales declines and loss of market share. If we are unable to increase market share in existing product lines, develop product innovations, undertake sales, marketing and advertising initiatives that grow our product categories or develop, acquire or successfully launch new products or brands, we may not achieve our sales growth objectives. Furthermore, a general decline in the markets for certain product categories has had and may in the future have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operation. In addition, changes to the mix of products that we sell, as well as the mix of countries in which we sell our products, may adversely impact our net sales, profitability and cash flow. 
 
 We are subject to risks related to our international operations, including currency fluctuations, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 
 We currently conduct our business on a worldwide basis, with more than 40 of our sales in fiscal year 2023 arising from foreign countries, and a significant portion of our production capacity and cash is located overseas. Consequently, we are subject to a number of risks associated with doing business in foreign countries, including: 
 
 unfavorable and uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions and potential operational or supply chain disruptions as a result of these developments; 
 political or economic instability, labor disputes, government corruption and civil unrest, including political or economic instability in the countries of the Eurozone, Egypt, Russia, the Middle East and certain markets in Latin America; 
 potential disruption from wars and military conflicts; 
 price controls and related government actions; 
 the possibility of nationalization of business or industries, expropriation, confiscatory taxation or other similar government action; 
 the inability to repatriate foreign-based cash for strategic needs in the U.S., either at all or without incurring significant income tax and earnings consequences, as well as the heightened counterparty, internal control and country-specific risks associated with holding cash overseas; 
 the effect of foreign income taxes, value-added taxes and withholding taxes, including the inability to recover amounts owed to us by a government authority without extended proceedings or at all; 
 the effect of the U.S. tax treatment of foreign source income and losses, and other restrictions on the flow of capital between countries; 
 adverse changes in local investment, local employment, local training or exchange control regulations; 
 legal and regulatory constraints, including the imposition of tariffs, trade restrictions, price, profit or other government controls, labor laws, immigration restrictions, travel restrictions, including as a result of COVID-19 or other outbreaks of infectious diseases, import and export laws or other government actions generating a negative impact on our business, including changes in trade policies that may be implemented; 
 currency fluctuations, including the impact of hyper-inflationary conditions in certain economies, particularly where exchange controls limit or eliminate our ability to convert from local currency; 
 difficulties in hiring and retaining qualified employees; 
 employment litigation related to employees, contractors and suppliers, particularly in Latin America and Europe; 
 difficulties in obtaining or unavailability of raw materials; 
 difficulty in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights; 
 continuing legal, political and economic uncertainty from the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, including the long-term impact of the bilateral trade and cooperation deal governing the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union and the potential for increasing divergence between the European Union and United Kingdom legal regimes; 
 lack of well-established or reliable, and impartial legal systems in certain countries where we operate; 
 challenges relating to enforcement of or compliance with local laws and regulations and with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the U.S., including without limitation, the U.S. FCPA; and 
 risks related to natural disasters, terrorism, social unrest and other events beyond our control. 
 
 We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks with respect to our net sales, net earnings and cash flow driven by movements of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. A weakening of the currencies in which sales are denominated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease net earnings and cash flow, and our foreign currency hedges only offset a portion of our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, including devaluations. Foreign currency fluctuations also may affect our ability to achieve sales growth. A weakening of foreign currencies in which we 
 13 

generate sales relative to the U.S. dollar would decrease our net sales. Accordingly, our reported net earnings may be negatively affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. 
 
 If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may manufacture and market similar products, which could adversely affect our market share and results of operations. 
 
 The vast majority of our total revenues are from products bearing proprietary trademarks. In addition, we own or license a number of patents, patent applications and other technology. We rely on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that we will be able to effectively utilize these intellectual property rights or that we can successfully assert or defend these rights. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect or maintain our own intellectual property rights or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions. In addition, even if we can protect such rights in the United States, the laws of some other countries in which we sell our products may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. It is also possible that our brands may not be available for use in certain countries due to prior third-party rights, thereby limiting expansion of our brands. If other parties infringe our intellectual property rights, they may dilute or diminish the value of our brands and products in the marketplace, which could diminish the value that consumers associate with our brands and harm our net sales. The failure to perfect and protect our intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 We cannot be certain that our intellectual property rights will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future, and we could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions relating to such rights. As patents expire, we could face increased competition, which could negatively impact our operating results. Additionally, a finding that we have violated the trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, through the use of third-party marks, ideas or technologies, could result in the need to cease use of such trademark, trade secret, copyrighted work or patented invention in our business, as well as the obligation to pay for past infringement. If holders are willing to permit us to continue to use such intellectual property rights, they could require a payment of a substantial amount for continued use of those rights. Either ceasing use or paying such amounts could cause us to become less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Operational and Technology Risks 
 
 Changes in production costs, including raw material prices and transportation costs, from inflation or otherwise, have adversely affected, and in the future could erode, our profit margins and negatively impact operating results. 
 
 Pricing and availability of raw materials, energy, transportation and other services needed for our business can be volatile due to general economic conditions, inflation, labor costs, production levels, import duties and tariffs and other factors beyond our control. There is no certainty that we will be able to offset future cost increases. This volatility can significantly affect our production cost and may, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Volatility, availability and increases in the cost of raw materials and transportation have negatively impacted, and are likely to continue to negatively impact, the Company's results of operations. Significant inflationary pressures have impacted our gross margin in fiscal 2022, and we expect inflationary pressures to continue into fiscal 2023. We believe commodity price and other cost increases and volatility, especially due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could continue in the future. If such increases occur or exceed our estimates and we are not able to increase the prices of our products or achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases, our results of operation would be harmed. In addition, even if we increase the prices of our products in response to increases in the cost of commodities, transportation or other cost increases, we may not be able to sustain our price increases. Sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or customers may decide not to pay the higher prices, which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share. Our projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our reliance on certain significant suppliers subjects us to numerous risks, including possible interruptions in supply, which could adversely affect our business. 
 
 Our ability to maintain consistent quality throughout our operations depends in part upon our ability to acquire certain products in sufficient quantities. Supply shortages for a particular component can delay production and thus delay shipments to customers and the associated revenue of all products using that component. This has caused, and, in the future, could cause us to experience a reduction in sales, increased inventory levels and costs and could adversely affect relationships with existing 
 14 

and prospective customers. In some cases, we may have only one supplier for a product or service. Our dependence on single -source suppliers subjects us to the possible risks of shortages, interruptions and price fluctuations, and possible litigation when we change vendors because of performance issues. Global economic factors continue to put significant pressure on suppliers, all of which tends to make the supply environment more expensive. If any of these vendors is unable to fulfill its obligations, or if we are unable to find replacement suppliers in the event of a supply disruption, we could encounter supply shortages and/or incur higher costs to secure adequate supplies, either of which could materially harm our business. 
 
 Our business is vulnerable to the availability of raw materials, as well as our ability to forecast customer demand and manage production capacity. 
 
 Our ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our production capacity and on obtaining timely and adequate delivery of materials, parts and components from our suppliers. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit the amounts supplied to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Supply disruptions may also occur due to shortages of critical materials. In addition, a number of our raw materials are obtained from a single supplier. Many of our suppliers must undertake a time-consuming qualification process before we can incorporate their raw materials into our production process. If we are unable to obtain materials from a qualified supplier, it can take up to a year to qualify a new supplier, assuming an alternative source of supply is available. Our raw materials and component parts are also susceptible to currency fluctuations and price fluctuations due to supply and demand, transportation, government regulations, price controls, tariffs, economic climate, or other unforeseen circumstances. A reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of one or more supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A reduction or disruption in our production capacity or our supplies could delay products and the fulfillment of orders and otherwise negatively impact our business and reputation. 
 
 We must accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and materials. If we overestimate demand, we may experience underutilized capacity and excess inventory levels. If we underestimate demand, we may miss delivery deadlines and sales opportunities and incur additional costs for labor overtime, equipment overuse and logistical complexities. In addition, sales of certain of our products tend to be seasonal. As a result of this seasonality, our inventory and working capital needs fluctuate significantly throughout the year. Orders from retailers are often made late in the period preceding the applicable peak season, making forecasting of production schedules and inventory purchases difficult. Difficulties in the production process could reduce yields or interrupt production, and, as a result, we may not be able to deliver products on time or in a cost-effective, competitive manner. Our failure to adequately manage our capacity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Additionally, as a result of the desire of retailers to more closely manage inventory levels, there is a growing trend among them to purchase products on a just-in-time basis. Due to a number of factors, including manufacturing lead-times, availability of raw materials, seasonal purchasing patterns and the potential for material price increases, we may be required to shorten our lead-time for production and more closely anticipate our retailers and customers demands, which has caused us to, and in the future could require us to, carry additional inventories and increase our working capital and related financing requirements. This may increase the cost of warehousing inventory or result in excess inventory becoming difficult to manage, unusable or obsolete. In addition, if our retailers significantly change their inventory management strategies, we may encounter difficulties in filling customer orders or in liquidating excess inventories, or may find that customers are cancelling orders or returning products, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 The manufacturing facilities, supply channels or other business operations of the Company and our suppliers may be subject to disruption from events beyond our control. 
 
 Operations of the manufacturing and packaging facilities worldwide and corporate offices of the Company and our suppliers, and the methods we and our suppliers use to obtain supplies and to distribute our products, may be subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including work stoppages, cyber-attacks and other disruptions in information technology systems, demonstrations, disease outbreaks or pandemics, acts of war or conflicts, terrorism, fire, earthquakes, flooding or other natural disasters, disruptions in logistics, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, supplier capacity constraints, raw material and product quality or safety issues, industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues, availability of raw materials, and other regulatory issues, trade disputes between countries in which we have operations, such as the U.S. and China. There is also a possibility that third-party manufacturers, which produce a significant portion of certain of our products, could discontinue production with little or no advance notice, or experience financial problems or problems with product quality or timeliness of product delivery, resulting in manufacturing delays or disruptions, regulatory sanctions, product liability claims or consumer complaints. If a major disruption were to occur, it could result in delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations. We maintain business interruption insurance to potentially mitigate the impact of business interruption, but such coverage may not be sufficient to offset the financial or reputational impact of an interruption. 
 15 

The Company's future results may be affected by its operational execution, including its ability to achieve cost savings as a result of any current or future restructuring efforts. 
 
 The Company's financial results depend on the successful execution of its business operating plans. To operate more efficiently and control costs, we have entered into, and may in the future enter into, restructuring and cost reduction plans (including Project Momentum, our previously announced profit recovery program). Our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions and other factors that we may not be able to control. We may also incur significant charges related to restructuring plans, which would reduce our profitability in the periods such charges are incurred. Execution of any restructuring program also presents a number of significant risks, including: 
 
 actual or perceived disruption of service or reduction in service standards to customers; 
 the failure to preserve adequate internal controls as we restructure our general and administrative functions, including our information technology and financial reporting infrastructure; 
 the failure to preserve supplier relationships and distribution, sales and other important relationships and to resolve conflicts that may arise; 
 loss of sales as we reduce or eliminate staffing for non-core product lines; 
 diversion of management attention from ongoing business activities; and 
 failure to maintain employee morale and retain key employees while implementing benefit changes and reductions in the workforce. 
 
 Gaining additional efficiencies may become increasingly difficult over time. If we are unable to generate anticipated cost savings, successfully implement our strategies or efficiently manage our supply chain and manufacturing processes, our results of operations could suffer. 
 
 In addition, the Company is executing its digital transformation program that is focused on redefining our processes, implementing new tools and expanding our data to enhance connectivity along the value chain and enable us to make decisions faster. We also continue to seek to penetrate new markets and introduce new products and product innovations. We may fail to implement these goals and strategies or to achieve the desired results, and we may fail to achieve one or more of our financial goals for one or more of the relevant fiscal years. 
 
 If our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets become impaired, we will be required to record impairment charges, which may be significant. 
 
 We have a material amount of goodwill and other intangible assets which are periodically evaluated for impairment in accordance with current accounting standards. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Fair value for both goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined based on a cash flow analysis. If the carrying values of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceed their fair value, the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered impaired. If current expectations for revenue growth rates, gross margin rates, operating expenses, and discount rates are not met, or other economic and financial market conditions were to change, we may be required in the future to record impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets during the period in which any impairment is determined. Any such impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 
 Sales of certain of our products are seasonal and adverse weather conditions during our peak selling seasons for certain auto care products could have a material adverse effect. 
 
 Sales of certain of our auto care products tend to be seasonal. Historically, sales for certain auto care products typically have peaked during the first six months of the calendar year due to customer seasonal purchasing patterns and the timing of promotional activities. Purchases of our auto care products, especially our auto appearance and A/C recharge products, can be significantly impacted by unfavorable weather conditions during the summer period, and as a result we may suffer decreases in net sales if conditions are not favorable for use of our products. If adverse weather conditions during the first six months of the calendar year (our second and third fiscal quarters) when demand for auto care products typically peaks persist, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 16 

A failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact our ability to conduct business. 
 
 We rely extensively on information technology systems, including some that are managed by third-party service providers, in order to conduct business. These systems include, but are not limited to, programs and processes relating to internal and external communications, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, and complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements. These information technology systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to the poor performance or failure of third-party service providers, catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, network outages, failed upgrades or other similar events. If our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in conducting our business, which may adversely impact our operating results. In addition, we continuously assess and implement upgrades to improve our information technology systems globally. As such, during these implementation periods, we face a heightened risk of system interruptions and deficiencies or failures in our internal controls involving our information systems and processes. 
 
 We continue to utilize various legacy hardware, software and operating systems, which may be vulnerable to increased risks, including the risk of system failures and disruptions, and may need to be upgraded or replaced in the future as third-party service providers stop supporting these systems. If we do not successfully upgrade or replace these legacy systems in a timely manner, system outages, disruptions or delays, or other issues may arise. We must also successfully integrate the technology systems of acquired companies into our existing and future technology systems, including with third-party service providers and processes. If a new system does not function properly or is not adequately supported by third-party service providers and processes, it could limit or prevent us from processing and delivering customer orders and processing and receiving payments for our products. This could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 We rely significantly on information technology and any inadequacy, interruption, theft or loss of data, malicious attack, integration failure, failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on our systems or other security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business and damage the reputation of our brands. 
 
 Our systems and networks, as well as those of our retailer customers, suppliers, service providers, and banks, have and may in the future become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches, which in turn could result in the unauthorized release and misuse of confidential or proprietary information about our company, employees, customers or consumers, as well as disrupt their and our operations or damage their and our facilities or those of third parties. We have seen an increase in the number of such attacks since a large number of our employees began working remotely. Furthermore, such attacks may originate from nation states or attempts by outside parties, hackers, criminal organizations or other threat actors. Any significant breaches or breakdowns of such databases or systems could result in significant costs, including costs to investigate or remediate. While we have taken steps to maintain and enhance cyber security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing security technologies, internal controls, network and data center resiliency, redundancy and recovery processes, upgrading our remote work environment and by obtaining insurance coverage, these measures may be inadequate. In addition, such incidents could result in unauthorized disclosure and misuse of material confidential information. Cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated, are constantly evolving and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives, and this increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Data breaches or theft of personal information we and our third-party service providers collect, as well as company information and assets, have occurred in the past and may occur in the future and the failure to remediate such intrusions may adversely affect our reputation and financial condition. 
 
 We may not be able to attract, retain and develop key employees, as well as effectively manage human capital resources. 
 
 Our future performance depends significantly upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key employees, as well as our continuing ability to attract, retain and develop highly qualified and diverse employees, including future members of our management team. Competition for such employees is intense, and there can be no assurance that we can retain and motivate our key employees or attract and retain other highly qualified employees in the future. 
 
 In addition, competition for labor remains strong and labor costs for manufacturing in the US and Singapore, among other countries, continue to rise. Labor is one of the primary components in the cost of operating our business. If we face labor shortages and increased labor costs as a result of increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover rates, increases in employee benefits costs, or labor union organizing efforts, our operating expenses could increase and results of operations could be adversely impacted. Labor shortages, higher employee turnover rates and labor union organizing efforts could also lead to disruptions in our business. 
 
 17 

A failure to adequately manage human capital resources could have a material adverse effective on our business, prospects, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the escalating costs of offering and administering health care, retirement and other benefits for employees could result in reduced profitability. 
 
 Financial and Strategic Risks 
 
 We have significant debt obligations that could adversely affect our business. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, our total aggregate outstanding indebtedness was approximately 3.4 billion. We had 492.9 million of additional capacity available under a senior secured revolving credit facility, inclusive of issued and outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 7.1 million. This significant amount of debt could have important consequences to us and our shareholders, including: 
 
 requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on this debt, thereby limiting the cash we have available to fund future growth opportunities, such as research and development, capital expenditures and acquisitions; 
 restrictive covenants in our debt arrangements that limit our operations and borrowing, and place restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase common stock; 
 the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt or rising interest rates on our variable rate debt increasing future debt costs and limiting the future availability of debt financing; 
 increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry, due to the need to use our cash to service our outstanding debt; 
 placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged with debt and that may therefore be able to invest more in their business or use their available cash to pursue other opportunities, including acquisitions; and 
 limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. 
 
 In addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of our outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance our debt. 
 
 We may need to seek additional financing for our general corporate purposes. For example, we may need to increase our investment in research and development activities or require funding to make acquisitions. Although the indentures and credit agreements relating to our existing debt contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and, under certain circumstances, the amount of debt that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. We may be unable to obtain desired additional financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. For example, during periods of volatile credit markets, there is a risk that lenders, even those with strong balance sheets and sound lending practices, could fail or refuse to honor their credit commitments and obligations, including, but not limited to, extending credit up to the maximum permitted by a credit facility and otherwise accessing capital or honoring loan commitments. If our lenders are unable to fund borrowings under their loan commitments or we are unable to borrow, it could be difficult to replace such loan commitments on similar terms or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund growth opportunities, successfully develop or enhance products, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect our business. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, our shareholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to limitations on our operations and ability to pay dividends due to restrictive covenants. Generally, to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, all of the risks described above in connection with our debt obligations could increase. 
 
 Our credit ratings are important to our cost of capital. 
 
 We expect that the major credit rating agencies will continue to evaluate our creditworthiness and give us specified credit ratings. These credit ratings are limited in scope, and do not address all material risks related to investment in Energizer, but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued. Nonetheless, the credit ratings we receive will impact our borrowing costs as well as our access to sources of capital on terms that will be advantageous to our business. Failure to obtain sufficiently high credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate in future financings, our liquidity or our competitive position and could also restrict our access to capital markets. There can be no assurance that any credit ratings we receive will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agencies if, in such rating agency s judgments, circumstances so warrant. 
 18 

We may experience losses or be subject to increased funding and expenses related to our pension plans. 
 
 We assumed pension plan liabilities related to our current and former employees in connection with the separation. Effective January 1, 2014, the pension benefit earned to date by active participants under the legacy U.S. pension plan was frozen and future retirement service benefits are no longer accrued under this retirement program; however, our pension plan obligations remain significant. If the investment of plan assets does not provide the expected long-term returns, if interest rates or other assumptions change, or if governmental regulations change the timing or amounts of required contributions to the plans, we could be required to make significant additional pension contributions, which may have an adverse impact on our liquidity, our ability to comply with debt covenants and may require recognition of increased expense within our financial statements. 
 
 The estimates and assumptions on which our financial projections are based may prove to be inaccurate, which may cause our actual results to materially differ from our projections, which may adversely affect our future profitability, cash flows and stock price. 
 
 Our financial projections, including any sales or earnings guidance or outlook we may provide from time to time, depend on certain estimates and assumptions related to, among other things, a number of factors: product category growth; development and launch of innovative new products; market share projections; product pricing and sale, volume and product mix; foreign exchange rates and volatility; tax rates; manufacturing costs including commodity prices; distribution channel volume and costs; cost savings; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves, measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans; and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business, fund internal growth, repurchase our stock, make acquisitions, pay dividends and meet debt obligations. 
 
 We develop our financial projections based on historical experience and on various other estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made. Our actual results may differ materially from our financial projections. Any material variation between our financial projections and our actual results may adversely affect our future profitability, cash flows and stock price. 
 
 If we pursue strategic acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures, we might experience operating difficulties, dilution, and other consequences that may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results, and we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses. 
 
 From time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures that could further our strategic objectives. With respect to acquisitions, we may not be able to identify suitable candidates, consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us, or achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of integration challenges. Some of the areas where we face risks include: 
 
 Diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and other strategic transactions; 
 Failure to successfully integrate and further develop the acquired business or technology; 
 Implementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company; 
 Integration of the acquired company s accounting, human resource, and other administrative systems, and coordination of research and development, commercial and marketing functions; 
 Transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms; 
 Failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions placed upon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction; 
 In the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; 
 Cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire; 
 Liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, data privacy and security issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; and 
 Litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated colleagues, customers, former shareholders, or other third parties. 
 
 19 

Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and other strategic transactions could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally. 
 
 Acquired companies or operations, joint ventures or investments may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability and cash flow expectations. Future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, and increased operating expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, to the extent that the economic benefits associated with an acquisition or investment diminish in the future or the performance of an acquired company or business is less robust than expected, we may be required to record impairments of intangible assets, including trademarks and goodwill. Any impairment charges could adversely affect the Company s financial condition and results of operations. See Note 11, Goodwill and intangible assets for further information related to goodwill and intangible assets, and the impairment charges recorded in the year ended September 30, 2022. 
 
 We have divested and may, in the future, divest certain assets, businesses or brands that do not meet our strategic objectives or growth targets. With respect to any potential future divestiture, we may encounter difficulty finding potential acquirers or other divestiture options on favorable terms. Any future divestiture could affect our profitability as a result of the gains or losses on such sale of a business or brand, the loss of the operating income or sales resulting from such sale or the costs or liabilities that we retain, which may negatively impact profitability and cash flow subsequent to any divestiture. We may also be required to recognize impairment charges or other losses as a result of a divestiture. 
 
 Legal, Compliance and Sustainability Risks 
 
 Our business involves the potential for product liability claims, labeling claims, commercial claims and other legal claims against us, which could affect our results of operations and financial condition and result in product recalls or withdrawals. 
 
 We face exposure to claims arising out of alleged defects in our products, including for property damage, bodily injury or other adverse effects; alleged contaminants in our products; and allegations that our products provide inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use; and failure to perform as advertised. Product liability, advertising and labeling claims could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation, sales and results of operation. If any of our products are found to be defective, we may recall or withdraw such products, which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. We maintain product liability insurance, but this insurance does not cover all types of claims, particularly claims that do not involve personal injury or property damage or claims that exceed the amount of insurance coverage. Further, we may not be able to maintain such insurance in sufficient amounts, on desirable terms, or at all, in the future. In addition to the risk of monetary judgments not covered by insurance, product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm our products reputation and in certain cases require a product recall or withdrawal. Product recalls or withdrawals or product liability claims, and any subsequent remedial actions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, brand value, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 In addition, we are, and may in the future become, the subject of, or party to, various pending or threatened legal actions, government investigations and proceedings relating to, among other things, advertising disputes with competitors, consumer class actions, including those related to advertising claims, labor claims, breach of contract claims, antitrust litigation, securities litigation, premises liability claims, data privacy and security disputes, employment litigation related to employees, contractors and suppliers, including class action lawsuits, and litigation in foreign jurisdictions. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to additional claims, proceedings and actions as we expand the products within the global auto care product category. In general, claims made by or against us in litigation, investigations, disputes or other proceedings have been and may in the future be expensive and time-consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements, injunctions or damages that could significantly affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and harm our reputation. It is not possible to predict the final resolution of litigation, investigations, disputes or proceedings in which we currently are or may in the future become involved and our assessment of the materiality of these matters and any reserves taken in connection therewith may not be consistent with their final resolutions. The impact of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection with such matters, on our business, financial condition and results of operations could be material. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in for additional information related to these matters. 
 
 Our business is subject to increasing government regulations in both the U.S. and abroad that could impose material costs. 
 
 In general, the manufacture, marketing, distribution, and sale of Energizer's products and the conduct of its business operations must comply with extensive federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. In the US, many of the Company's 
 20 

products and product claims are regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Federal Trade Commission, among other regulatory agencies. Additionally, the Company's and its suppliers' manufacturing and distribution operations are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Energizer's international operations are also subject to regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which it manufactures, markets or distributes its products. There is also an increased risk of fraud or corruption in certain foreign jurisdictions and related difficulties in maintaining effective internal controls. Additionally, the Company could be subject to future inquiries or investigations by governmental and other regulatory bodies. Any determination that the Company's operations or activities are not in compliance with applicable law could expose the Company to future impairment charges or significant fines, penalties or other sanctions that may result in a reduction in net income or otherwise adversely impact the business and reputation of the Company. 
 
 In particular, because of the Company s extensive international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations, or allegations of violations, of the FCPA and similar international anti-bribery and corruption laws. These laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls policies and procedures that mandate compliance with these laws will protect us from reckless, intentional or unintentional criminal acts. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Federal, state and foreign governments may introduce new or expand existing legislation and regulations, or courts or governmental authorities could impose more stringent interpretations of existing legislation and regulations, that may adversely affect our operations or require us to increase our resources, capabilities and expertise in certain areas, as well as incur increased compliance costs. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, foreign, state and local governmental authorities. 
 
 In recent years, refrigerants such as R-134a have become the subject of regulatory focus due to their potential to contribute to global warming. The EU has passed regulations that essentially phased out of R-134a in automotive cooling systems in new vehicles by 2017. Canada has also implemented similar regulations, phasing into effect beginning in 2021. In the United States, the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act (AIM Act) and its resultant regulations could have a materially adverse impact on our business. In addition, individual states are regulating the sale and distribution of products containing R-134a. Regulations may also be enacted governing the packaging, use and disposal of our auto care business' products containing refrigerants. If the future use of R-134a is phased out or is limited or prohibited in jurisdictions in which we do business, or if substitutes for R-134a become widely used in A/C systems and their use for DIY and retrofit purposes is not approved by the EPA or other regulatory bodies, the future market for our auto care business' products containing R-134a may be limited, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 
 
 Our systems and those of our business partners are subject to regulation to preserve the privacy of certain data held on those systems. Privacy and data protection laws and regulations, including with respect to the EU s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Brazilian Data Protection Law, and the California CCPA, and the interpretation and enforcement of those and similar laws and regulations, are continuously developing and evolving and there may be uncertainty with respect to how to comply with them. The changes introduced by existing privacy and data protection laws and regulations and the introduction of similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions, have subjected, and may continue in the future to subject, us to additional costs and have required, and may in the future require, costly changes to our security systems, policies, procedures and practices. We may also be required to incur additional costs to modify or enhance their or our systems or in order to prevent or remediate any such issues. Our efforts to comply with privacy and data protection laws and regulations may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 If the Company is found to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations in these or other areas, it could be subject to governmental or regulatory actions, including fines, import detentions, injunctions, product withdrawals or recalls or asset seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions and damage to our reputation and brand image, or require the payment of monetary penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if a claim is unsuccessful, is not merited or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions could jeopardize our reputation and brand image and have a material adverse effect on our businesses, as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation. Additionally, loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations, particularly with respect to our global auto care business, could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand, introducing new products, building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 21 

Increased focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations, customers, consumers and shareholders on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, including those related to sustainability and climate change, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation . 
 
 Energizer is committed to its sustainability journey and has taken meaningful steps including conducting an extensive materiality assessment and publishing ESG goals. Any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or a perception (whether or not valid) of our failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to new, or changes in, legal or regulatory requirements concerning climate change or other sustainability concerns could adversely affect our business and reputation. 
 
 As climate change, land use, water use, deforestation, plastic waste, recyclability or recoverability of packaging, including single-use and other plastic packaging, responsible sourcing, and other sustainability concerns become more prevalent, governmental and non-governmental organizations, customers, consumers and investors are increasingly focusing on these issues. In particular, changing consumer preferences may result in increased customer and consumer concerns and demands regarding plastics and packaging materials, including single-use and non-recyclable plastic packaging, and their environmental impact on sustainability, a growing demand for natural or organic products and ingredients, or increased consumer concerns or perceptions (whether accurate or inaccurate) regarding the effects of ingredients or substances present in certain consumer products. This increased focus may result in new or increased regulations and customer, consumer and investor demands that could cause us to incur additional costs or to make changes to our operations to comply with any such regulations and address demands. If we are unable to respond or perceived to be inadequately responding to sustainability concerns, customers and consumers may choose to purchase products from another company or a competitor, and certain investors may divert from, or avoid investing in, our securities. 
 
 We are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may expose us to significant liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 We must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, recycling of batteries and packaging, the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances, chemicals in products and product safety. A release of such substances due to accident or an intentional act or the presence of contamination that predates our ownership or operation of our facilities could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities or to third parties. Pursuant to certain environmental laws, we could be subject to joint and several strict liability for contamination relating to our or their predecessors current or former properties or any of their respective third-party waste disposal sites. In addition to potentially significant investigation and remediation costs, any such contamination can give rise to claims from governmental authorities or other third parties for natural resource damage, personal injury, property damage or other liabilities. Contamination has been identified at certain of our current and former facilities as well as third-party waste disposal sites, and we are conducting investigation and remediation activities in relation to such properties. The discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of further cleanup obligations at these or other properties or the assertion of tort claims related to such contamination could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenses and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations, including with respect to current and formerly owned facilities, as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to whom we have sent waste. As new laws and regulations are introduced, we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 The resolution of our tax contingencies may result in additional tax liabilities, which could adversely impact our cash flows and results of operations. 
 
 Significant estimation and judgment are required in determining our tax provisions for taxes in the U.S. and jurisdictions outside the U.S. In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly audited by tax authorities and, although we believe our tax positions are defensible and our tax provision estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. When particular tax matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved. Unfavorable resolution of any tax matter in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the effective tax rate, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution. 
 
 Risks Specific to Our Common Stock 
 
 We cannot guarantee the timing, amount or payment of dividends on our common stock. 
 
 22 

The timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to shareholders will fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors. The Board s decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, covenants associated with certain of our debt service obligations, legal requirements and regulatory constraints. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to pay dividends in the future. 
 
 Risk Related to Anti-Takeover Measures 
 
 Certain provisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws, and of Missouri law, may deter or delay an acquisition of Energizer. 
 
 Our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain, and the General and Business Corporation Law of Missouri, which we refer to as Missouri law, contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover by making the replacement of incumbent directors more time-consuming and difficult. These provisions include, among others: 
 
 limitations on the ability of our shareholders to call a special meeting; 
 rules regarding how we may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings; 
 the right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval; 
 a provision that our shareholders may only remove directors for cause and with the approval of the holders of two-thirds of our outstanding voting stock at a special meeting of shareholders called expressly for that purpose; and 
 the ability of our directors, and not shareholders, to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors. 
 
 In addition, because we have not chosen to opt out of coverage of Section 351.459 of Missouri law, which we refer to as the business combination statute, these provisions could also deter or delay a change of control. The business combination statute restricts certain business combination transactions between us and an interested shareholder, generally any person who, together with his or her affiliates and associates, owns or controls 20 or more of the outstanding shares of our voting stock, for a period of five years after the date of the transaction in which the person becomes an interested shareholder, unless either such transaction or the interested shareholder s acquisition of stock is approved by our Board on or before the date the interested shareholder obtains such status. The business combination statute also provides that, after the expiration of such five-year period, business combinations are prohibited unless (i) the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting stock, other than the stock owned by the interested shareholder, or any affiliate or associate of such interested shareholder, approve the business combination or (ii) the business combination satisfies certain detailed fairness and procedural requirements. 
 
 We believe that these provisions will help to protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could deter or delay an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in our best interests or the best interests of our shareholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings 
 
 We are parties to a number of legal proceedings in various jurisdictions arising out of our business operations in the normal course of business. Many of these legal matters are in preliminary stages and involve complex issues of law and fact, and may proceed for protracted periods of time. The amount of liability, if any, from these proceedings cannot be determined with certainty. However, based upon present information, we believe that our liability, if any, arising from such pending legal proceedings, asserted legal claims and known potential legal claims which are likely to be asserted, are not reasonably likely to be material to our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, taking into account established accruals for estimated liabilities.

Item 6. R eserved. 

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion is a summary of the key factors management considers necessary in reviewing the Company's results of operations, operating segment results, and liquidity and capital resources. Statements in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) that are not historical may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
 
 You should read the following MD A in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and corresponding notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This MD A contains forward-looking statements. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risk, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. Please see Part I. Item 1A Risk Factors above and Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. 
 
 All amounts discussed are in millions of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated. 
 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This document contains both historical and forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead reflect our expectations, estimates or projections concerning future results or events, including, without limitation, the future sales, gross margins, costs, earnings, cash flows, tax rates and performance of the Company. These statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such as "believe," "expect," "expectation," "anticipate," "may," "could," "intend," "belief," "estimate," "plan," "target," "predict," "likely," "should," "forecast," "outlook," or other similar words or phrases. These statements are not guarantees of performance and are inherently subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by those statements. We cannot assure you that any of our expectations, estimates or projections will be achieved. The forward-looking statements included in this document are only made as of the date of this document and we disclaim any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. All forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty. Numerous factors could cause our actual results and events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors," as updated from time to time in the Company s SEC filings. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users with additional meaningful comparisons to the corresponding historical or future period, and are used for management incentive compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that are not reflective of the Company's on-going operating performance, such as Project Momentum restructuring and related costs, acquisition and integration costs, an acquisition earn out, an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, the (gain)/loss on extinguishment of debt, the settlement loss on U.S. pension annuity buyout, the costs of exiting the Russian market, the gain on finance lease termination, the costs of the May 2022 flooding of our Brazilian manufacturing facility, and the one-time impact of Tax structuring. In addition, these measures help investors to analyze year over year comparability when excluding currency fluctuations, acquisition activity as well as other company initiatives that are not on-going. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are an enhancement to assist investors in understanding our business and in performing analysis consistent with financial models developed by research analysts. Investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted. 
 
 We provide the following non-GAAP measures and calculations, as well as the corresponding reconciliation to the closest GAAP measure: 
 
 Segment Profit. This amount represents the operations of our two reportable segments including allocations for shared support functions. General corporate and other expenses, amortization expense, impairment of goodwill and intangible 
 28 

assets, interest expense, (gain)/loss on extinguishment of debt, other items, net, Project Momentum restructuring and related costs, acquisition and integration costs, an acquisition earn out, settlement loss on U.S. pension annuity buyout, the gain on finance lease termination, the costs of exiting the Russian market and the costs of the flooding of our Brazilian manufacturing facility have all been excluded from segment profit. 
 
 Adjusted net earnings and Adjusted Diluted net earnings per common share (EPS). These measures exclude the impact of Project Momentum restructuring and related costs, costs related to acquisition and integration, an acquisition earn out, an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, the (gain)/loss on extinguishment of debt, the settlement loss on U.S. pension annuity buyout, the gain on finance lease termination, the costs of exiting the Russian market, the costs of the flooding of our Brazilian manufacturing facility and the one-time impact of Tax structuring. 
 
 Non-GAAP Tax Rate. This is the tax rate when excluding the pre-tax impact of Project Momentum restructuring and related costs, acquisition and integration costs, an acquisition earn out, an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, the (gain)/loss on extinguishment of debt, the settlement loss on U.S. pension annuity buyout, the gain on finance lease termination, the costs of exiting the Russian market and the costs of the flooding of our Brazilian manufacturing facility, as well as the related tax impact for these items, calculated utilizing the statutory rate for where the impact was incurred, as well as the one-time impact of Tax structuring. 
 
 Organic. This is the non-GAAP financial measurement of the change in revenue or segment profit that excludes or otherwise adjusts for the change in Russia and Argentina operations and the impact of currency from the changes in foreign currency exchange rates as defined below: 
 
 Change in Russia Operations. The Company exited the Russian market in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 due to the increased global and economic and political uncertainty resulting from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. This adjusts for the change in Russian sales and segment profit from the prior year post exit. 
 
 Change in Argentina Operations. The Company is presenting separately all changes in sales and segment profit from our Argentina affiliate due to the designation of the economy as highly inflationary as of July 1, 2018. 
 
 Impact of currency . The Company evaluates the operating performance of our Company on a currency neutral basis. The Impact of Currency is the change in foreign currency exchange rates year-over-year on reported results, which is calculated by comparing the value of current year foreign operations at the current period USD exchange rate versus the value of current year foreign operations at the prior period USD exchange rate. The impact of currency also includes gains/(losses) of currency hedging programs, and it excludes hyper-inflationary markets. 
 
 Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, adjusted Selling, General Administrative (SG A) as a percent of sales and adjusted Other items, net. Details for adjusted gross margin, adjusted SG A as a percent of sales and adjusted Other items, net are also supplemental non-GAAP measure disclosures. These measures exclude the impact of Project Momentum restructuring and related costs, acquisition and integration costs, an acquisition earn out, the settlement loss on U.S. pension annuity buyout, the gain on finance lease termination, the costs of exiting the Russian market and the costs of the flooding of our manufacturing facility in Brazil. 
 
 Coronavirus (COVID-19) 
 
 We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our businesses and the overall economy. Uncertainty regarding any future impact of the pandemic on our businesses remains, and such impacts will ultimately depend on the length and severity of the pandemic, among other factors. 
 
 Macroeconomic Environment 
 
 We continue to operate in an inflationary environment where macro-economic pressures and geopolitical instability are expected to continue into fiscal year 2024. While we did not experience significant disruptions in our operations in fiscal 2023, the risks of future negative impacts due to transportation, logistical or supply constraints and higher commodity costs for certain raw materials remain present, and the Company could continue to experience corresponding incremental costs and gross margin pressures. 
 
 29 

Exit of Russian Market 
 
 During the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company exited the Russian market due to global economic and political uncertainty related to the conflict between Russian and the Ukraine and the resultant sanctions imposed on Russia. 
 
 While neither Russia nor Ukraine constitutes a material portion of our business, a significant escalation or expansion of economic disruption or the conflict's current scope could disrupt our supply chain, broaden inflationary costs, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our Russian subsidiary comprised approximately one percent of our business. 
 
 With the decision to exit the Russian market, the Company terminated the employment of all our Russian colleagues and reviewed our Russian assets for impairment. Exiting the Russian market resulted in additional Costs of products sold of 1.3 related to the impairment of inventory in Russia and shipping costs to get inventory to other markets, impairment of other assets and severance recorded to SG A of 5.8, and currency impacts recorded in Other items, net of 7.5 in fiscal 2022. 
 
 Brazil Manufacturing Plant Flood 
 
 In May 2022, the Company's Jaboatao, Brazil battery manufacturing facility had severe flooding due to historic levels of rain in the area. The plant was not operational for the month of June, however some production began again in July and was back on line in fiscal 2023. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, the Company recorded costs related to the flood net of insurance proceeds of 9.7 in Cost of products sold, primarily related to damaged inventory at the plant. In fiscal 2023, the insurance claim was settled and no further losses are expected. 
 
 Recent Acquisitions 
 
 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with FDK Corporation to acquire its subsidiary PT FDK Indonesia, a battery manufacturing facility. On October 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition for a contractual purchase price of 18.2. After contractual and working capital adjustments, the Company paid cash of 16.9 and a working capital adjustment of 0.7 during fiscal 2021. The acquisition of the FDK Indonesia facility increased the Company's alkaline battery production capacity and allows us to avoid future planned capital expenditures. 
 
 On December 1, 2020 the Company acquired a North Carolina-based company that specializes in developing formulations for cleaning tasks. Their products are both sold to customers directly and licensed to manufacturers. This acquisition is expected to bring significant innovation capabilities in formulations to our organization. The purchase price and total cash paid for the acquisition was 51.2. During fiscal 2022, the working capital settlement was finalized, reducing the purchase price by 1.0. 
 
 On January 2, 2019, the Company acquired Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc.'s (Spectrum) global battery, lighting and portable power business (Battery Acquisition) including the brands Rayovac and Varta . The acquisition expanded our battery portfolio globally with the addition of a strong value brand. On January 2, 2020, the Company sold the Varta consumer battery business in the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions, including manufacturing and distribution facilities in Germany. 
 
 On January 28, 2019, the Company acquired Spectrum s global auto care business, including Armor All , STP , and A/C PRO brands (Auto Care Acquisition). 
 
 Acquisition and Integration Costs 
 
 The Company incurred pre-tax acquisition and integration costs related to the above acquisitions of 16.5 and 68.9 in the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. There were no acquisition and integration costs during the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Pre-tax costs recorded in Costs of products sold were 6.0 and 33.7 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively, which primarily related to facility exit and integration restructuring costs of 5.2 and 31.9 as discussed in Note 5, Restructuring. 
 
 Pre-tax acquisition and integration costs recorded in SG A were 9.4 and 40.0 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In fiscal 2022, the SG A expenses primarily related to the integration of acquired information technology systems, consulting costs, and retention-related compensation costs. In fiscal 2021, the SG A expenses 
 30 

primarily related to consulting fees for the 2020 restructuring program, success incentives, and costs of integrating the information technology systems of the Battery and Auto Care Acquisition businesses. 
 
 For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 the Company recorded 1.1 each year in Research and development. 
 
 Included in Other items, net was pre-tax income of 5.9 in the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. The pre-tax income was primarily driven by the gain on a sale of assets of 3.3, which was part of the integration restructuring discussed in Note 5, Restructuring. 
 
 Restructuring Costs 
 
 In November 2022, the Board of Directors approved a profit recovery program, Project Momentum, which includes an enterprise-wide restructuring focused on recovering operating margins, optimizing our manufacturing, distribution and global supply chain networks, and enhancing our organizational efficiency across the Company. In July 2023, the Company's Board of Directors approved an expansion of this program to include an additional year, which will allow for additional optimization of our battery manufacturing, distribution and global supply chain networks, further review of our global real estate footprint and the implementation of IT systems that will allow us to streamline our organization and fully execute the program and increase the savings by 50 annually. 
 
 The restructuring component of the program is now expected to generate 115 to 130 of annual pre-tax savings, and the Company estimates that it will incur one-time cash operating costs of 95 to 110, non-cash costs of 12, and capital expenditures of 70 to 80 over the three year program. Additionally, along side the restructuring component of the program, Project Momentum includes continuous improvement and working capital initiatives that are designed to strengthen our balance sheet, focus on cash flow, and generate P L savings of approximately 15 to 20 annually. Total expected pre-tax savings of Project Momentum are between 130 and 150 by the end of fiscal year 2025, with approximately 54 of those savings recognized in fiscal year 2023. 
 
 In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019, the Company began implementing restructuring related integration plans for our manufacturing and distribution networks. These plans include the closure and combination of distribution and manufacturing facilities in order to reduce complexity and realize greater efficiencies in our manufacturing, packaging and distribution processes. All activities within this plan were substantially complete by December 31, 2021. 
 
 Part of this plan was the exit of our Dixon, IL leased packaging facility, which the Company vacated during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. In the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company entered into a termination agreement with the landlord. The Company terminated the lease agreement, which went into 2028, reducing the finance lease obligations by 9.8. The termination agreement required the Company to pay a termination fee of 4.0, as well as decommissioning costs and brokerage fees. Since the Company has already vacated the facility as part of the 2019 restructuring program, most assets associated with the location have already been fully depreciated. The termination of this lease resulted in a gain of 4.5 recognized in Other items, net during fiscal 2022. 
 
 In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020, the Company initiated a new restructuring program with a primary focus on reorganizing our global end-to-end supply chain network and ensuring accountability by category. This program includes streamlining the Company s end-to-end supply chain model to enable rapid response to category specific demands and enhancing our ability to better serve our customers. Planning and execution of this program began in fiscal year 2021, with all programs substantially complete by December 31, 2021. 
 
 The total pre-tax expense related to these restructuring plans for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were 59.7, 1.7, and 36.8, respectively. These consisted of charges for employee severance, retention, related benefit costs, accelerated depreciation, asset write-offs, relocation and decommissioning costs, environmental investigatory and mitigation costs, consulting costs and other exit costs, offset by a gain on finance lease termination in fiscal 2022 and a gain on sale of fixed assets in fiscal 2021. The costs were reflected in Cost of products sold, Selling, general and administrative expense, Research and development, and Other items, net on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. 
 
 A lthough the Company's restructuring costs are recorded outside of segment profit, if allocated to our reportable segments, the restructuring costs noted above fiscal 2023 would have been included in our Batteries Lights and Auto Care segments in the amount of 52.7 and 7.0, respectively. The restructuring costs noted above for fiscal year 2022 would have been included in our Batteries Lights and Auto Care segments in the amount of 1.3 and 0.4, respectively. The restructuring 
 31 

costs noted above for fiscal year 2021 would have been incurred within our Batteries Lights and Auto Care segments in the amount of 30.7 and 6.1, respectively. 
 
 Total pre-tax charges related to Project Momentum since inception was 60.6. Total pre-tax charges relating to the 2019 restructuring program since inception was also 60.6. Total pre-tax charges relating to the 2020 restructuring program since inception are 19.4. 
 
 Fiscal 2022 marked the conclusion of the 2019 and 2020 Restructuring programs. The full amount of savings are now included within our run-rate cost structure. Energizer estimates that total project savings were approximately 55 to 60. The primary impact of the savings were reflected in Cost of products sold. Savings related to the restructuring programs have been fully realized as of September 30, 2022. We do not expect to incur additional material charges for these programs.

Operating Results 
 For the Years Ended September 30, Net Sales 2023 Chg 2022 Chg Net sales - prior year 3,050.1 3,021.5 Organic (31.6) (1.0) 94.4 3.1 Change in Russia Operations (12.6) (0.4) (19.3) (0.6) Change in Argentina Operations (5.3) (0.2) 11.9 0.4 Impact of currency (40.9) (1.4) (58.4) (2.0) Net sales - current year 2,959.7 (3.0) 3,050.1 0.9 
 
 Net sales for the year ended September 30, 2023 were 2,959.7, a decrease of 3.0 from the prior year. Organic net sales decreased 1.0 primarily due to: 
 
 Volume declines of approximately 7.5 due to lower category volumes across both battery and auto care from higher retail pricing and general economic conditions impacting category performance and weaker battery performance across non-tracked channels; 
 
 Volume declines of approximately 1.0 from the planned exit of low margin business, a decline in our sales to device manufacturers due to their delay of new product launches and fourth quarter lost battery distribution in international markets; and 
 
 Partially offsetting these declines was the continued benefit of global pricing actions in both the battery and auto care businesses which increased organic sales by approximately 7.5 . 
 
 Net sales for the year ended September 30, 2022 were 3,050.1, an increase of 0.9 . Organic net sales increased 3.1 primarily due to: 
 
 Pricing executed in both battery and auto care drove an organic increase of approximately 7.6 ; and 
 
 New distribution globally across both battery and auto care contributed approximately 0.8 to organic growth. 
 
 Offsetting these increases was a net volume decrease of approximately 5.3 as a result of lapping the elevated battery demand in the prior year and declines in both battery and auto care related to the previously mentioned pricing actions.

 Gross Profit 
 
 Gross profit dollars were 1,124.0 in fiscal 2023 versus 1,119.5 in fiscal 2022. Excluding the current year Project Momentum restructuring costs of 29.9, and the prior year integration costs of 6.0, impact of costs from the flooding of our Brazilian manufacturing facility of 9.7 and exiting the Russian market of 1.3, gross profit dollars were 1,153.9 in fiscal 2023 versus 1,136.5 in fiscal 2022. The increase in gross profit dollars was driven by the positive impact of executed price increases in battery and auto care and Project Momentum savings of approximately 47. Partially offsetting these margin impacts were higher operating costs, including raw material costs, as well as adverse currency impacts. 
 
 Gross profit dollars were 1,119.5 in fiscal 2022 versus 1,161.4 in fiscal 2021. Excluding the fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 acquisition and integration costs of 6.0 and 33.7, respectively, and the fiscal 2022 impact of costs from the flooding of our Brazilian manufacturing facility of 9.7 and exiting the Russian market of 1.3, gross profit dollars were 1,136.5 in fiscal 2022 versus 1,195.1 in fiscal 2021. The decrease in gross profit dollars was driven by higher operating costs, including transportation, material and labor costs, consistent with ongoing inflationary trends. The later part of fiscal 2022 was further impacted by operating inefficiencies related to reduced production volumes as the Company lowered overall inventory levels on hand. Partially offsetting these margin impacts was the positive impact of executed price increases in battery and auto care, the elimination of fiscal 2021 COVID-19 costs and synergies of approximately 6. 
 
 Gross margin as a percent of Net sales for fiscal 2023 was 38.0 versus 36.7 in the prior year. Excluding the current year Project Momentum restructuring costs and the prior year costs from the flooding of our Brazilian manufacturing facility, exiting the Russian market and integration costs, the gross margin was 39.0 for the fiscal year, up 170 basis points from prior

year. Gross margin as a percent of Net sales for fiscal 2022 was 36.7 versus 38.4 in fiscal 2021. Excluding the fiscal 2022 and 2021 acquisition and integration costs, and the fiscal 2022 impact of costs from the flooding of our Brazilian manufacturing facility and exiting the Russian market, gross margin was 37.3 , down 230 basis points from prior year.

 Selling, General and Administrative (SG A) 
 
 SG A expenses were 489.4 in fiscal 2023, or 16.5 of net sales, as compared to 484.5, or 15.9 of net sales for fiscal 2022, and 487.2, or 16.1 of net sales for fiscal 2021. Included in SG A in fiscal 2023 and 2022 were Project Momentum restructuring and related costs of 30.0 and 0.9, respectively. Included in 2022 and 2021 were acquisition and integration costs of 9.4 and 40.0, respectively, and an acquisition earn out of 1.1 and 3.4, respectively, related to the Formulations Acquisition. Fiscal 2022 also included 5.8 related to the exit of the Russian market. 
 
 In fiscal 2023, SG A excluding Project Momentum restructuring and related costs was 459.4 or 15.5 , compared to fiscal 2022 of 467.3 or 15.3 , when excluding acquisition and integration costs, the earn out, costs from exiting the Russian market and Project Momentum restructuring and related costs. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by Project Momentum savings, favorable currency impacts and lower environmental costs this year due to a charge taken in the prior year related to a legacy facility that has been sold by the Company. These decreases were partially offset by higher compensation expense and factoring fees in fiscal 2023. 
 
 In fiscal 2022, SG A excluding acquisition and integration costs, the earn out, costs from exiting the Russian market 
 and Project Momentum restructuring and related costs was 467.3 or 15.3 , compared to fiscal 2021 of 443.8 or 14.7 . The increase was primarily driven by increased environmental costs related to a legacy facility that has been sold by the Company, recycling fees, travel and higher IT spending related to our investment in digital transformation. 
 
 Advertising and Sales Promotion (A P) 
 
 A P was 142.3 in fiscal 2023, an increase of 5.2 as compared to fiscal 2022 expense of 137.1. A P was 162.1 in fiscal 2021. A P as a percent of net sales was 4.8 , 4.5 and 5.4 in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 
 Research and Development (R D) 
 
 R D expense was 32.9 in fiscal 2023, 34.7 in fiscal 2022, 34.5 in fiscal 2021. As a percent of net sales, R D expense was consistent as a percentage of sales at 1.1 in all three fiscal years. 
 
 Amortization Expense 
 
 Amortization expense was 59.4, 61.1 and 61.2 in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The current year reduction is due to intangibles acquired as part of the Battery acquisition now being fully amortized, partially offset by the increased amortization from the STP trade name in fiscal 2023. 
 
 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
 
 38 

No impairment of goodwill and intangible assets was recorded in fiscal 2023 or 2021. Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for fiscal 2022 was 541.9. This included a non-cash impairment on the Armor All trade name of 370.4, STP trade name of 26.3, Rayovac trade name of 127.8 and a non-cash impairment related to the Auto Care International reporting unit goodwill of 17.4. For Armor All and STP, the non-cash impairments were primarily due to declines in their respective Auto Care category projections late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, significant increases in input costs, and a higher discount rate. The Rayovac non-cash impairment was primarily caused by significant sustained currency headwinds in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which were expected to, and did, continue into fiscal 2023, a decrease in the branded sales forecast, increases in input costs, and a higher discount rate. The goodwill non-cash impairment was primarily driven by significant sustained currency headwinds in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which were expected to, and did, continue into fiscal 2023, declines in the Auto Care category projections late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, and an increased discount rate. 
 
 Interest expense 
 
 Interest expense for fiscal 2023 was 168.7, as compared to fiscal 2022 expense of 158.4 and 161.8 in fiscal 2021. The increased interest expense in fiscal 2023 was due to higher interest rates compared to fiscal 2022, partially offset by lower average outstanding debt in the current year. The decrease in fiscal 2022 from fiscal 2021 was due to the Company continuing to take advantage of favorable debt markets in fiscal 2021 and refinancing its long-term debt. 
 
 (Gain)/loss on extinguishment of debt 
 
 The Gain on the extinguishment of debt was 1.5 for fiscal year 2023 and related to the Company's retirement of 25.0 of outstanding Senior Notes at a discount and the early repayment of 188.0 outstanding on the term loan in the current year. 
 
 The loss on the extinguishment of debt was 103.3 for fiscal year 2021 and relates to the Company's refinancing of its 650.0 Senior Notes due in 2026 in June 2021, the redemption of the 600.0 Senior Notes due in 2027 in January 2021 and the term loan refinancing in December 2020. The Company also amended certain covenants in its credit agreement, which created additional capacity and flexibility. 
 
 Other Items, Net 
 
 Other items, net was expense of 57.1, 7.3 and income of 2.9 in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is summarized below:

 Income Taxes 
 
 For fiscal 2023, the effective tax rate was 20.0 . Excluding the impact of our non-GAAP adjustments, the year to date adjusted effective tax rate was 21.2 as compared to 19.5 in the prior year. The increase in the rate versus prior year is primarily due to the release of reserves from statute limitations and settlements with tax authorities in the prior year. 
 
 For fiscal 2022, the effective tax rate was a benefit of 24.2 . The current year rate was unfavorably impacted by the tax impact of the goodwill impairment. Excluding the impact of our non-GAAP adjustments, the year to date adjusted effective 
 39 

tax rate was 19.5 as compared to 22.6 in the prior year. The decrease in the rate versus prior year is primarily due to the release of reserves from statute limitations and settlements with tax authorities. 
 
 For fiscal 2021, the effective tax rate was 4.3 . The current year rate was favorably impacted by tax structuring resulting in a reduction to a deferred tax liability and the favorable tax impact resulting from the refinancing of the 650.0 Senior Notes due in 2026 in June 2021. Excluding the impact of our non-GAAP adjustments, the year to date adjusted effective tax rate was 22.6 as compared to 23.3 in the prior year. The decrease in the rate versus prior year is due to the favorable return to provision adjustments and decreases in certain limited expenses. 
 
 Energizer s effective tax rate is highly sensitive to the mix of countries from which earnings or losses are derived. Declines in earnings in lower tax rate countries, earnings increases in higher tax rate countries, repatriation of foreign earnings or foreign operating losses in the future could increase future tax rates. In addition, the enactment of legislation implementing changes in the U.S. on the taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other U.S. tax reform could impact our effective tax rate in the future. 
 
 Argentina Hyperinflation 
 
 Effective July 1, 2018, the financial statements for our Argentina subsidiary are consolidated under the rules governing the translation of financial information in a highly inflationary economy. Under U.S. GAAP, an economy is considered highly inflationary if the cumulative inflation rate for a three year period meets or exceeds 100 percent. The Argentina economy exceeded the three year cumulative inflation rate of 100 percent as of June 2018 and remains highly inflationary as of September 30, 2023. If a subsidiary is considered to be in a highly inflationary economy, the financial statements of the subsidiary must be remeasured into the Company s reporting currency (U.S. dollar) and future exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in current earnings, rather than exclusively in the equity section of the balance sheet, until such time as the economy is no longer considered highly inflationary. It is difficult to determine what continuing impact the use of highly inflationary accounting for Argentina may have on our consolidated financial statements as such impact is dependent upon movements in the applicable exchange rates between the local currency and the U.S. dollar and the amount of monetary assets and liabilities included in our affiliates balance sheet. 
 
 Segment Results 
 
 During fiscal year 2022, the Company changed its reportable and operating segments from two geographical segments, previously Americas and International, to two product groupings, Battery Lights and Auto Care. This change came with the completion of the Battery and Auto Care Acquisition integrations in fiscal 2022. The Company changed its reporting structure to better reflect what the chief operating decision maker is reviewing to make organizational decisions and resource allocations. 
 
 Segment performance is evaluated based on segment operating profit, exclusive of general corporate expenses (including share-based compensation costs), amortization of intangibles, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, acquisition and integration activities, Project Momentum restructuring and related costs, acquisition earn out, the costs of the flooding of our manufacturing facility in Brazil, the costs of exiting the Russian market, the settlement loss on U.S. pension annuity buy out and other items determined to be corporate in nature. Financial items, such as interest income and expense, gain on finance lease termination and (gain)/loss on extinguishment of debt are managed on a global basis at the corporate level. The exclusion of acquisition and integration and Project Momentum restructuring and related costs from segment results reflects management s view on how it evaluates segment performance. The Company also excludes amortization of intangibles and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets from segments as these are non-cash items related to the original purchase of the intangibles and not utilized to evaluate current segment performance. 
 
 Energizer s operating model includes a combination of standalone and shared business functions between the product segments, varying by country and region of the world. Shared functions include the sales and marketing functions, as well as human resources, IT and finance shared service costs. Energizer applies a fully allocated cost basis, in which shared business functions are allocated between segments. Such allocations are estimates, and do not represent the costs of such services if performed on a standalone basis.

 Total net sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 decreased 3.0 , due to organic sales decline of 31.6, or 1.0 , a decrease in sales from exiting the Russian market of 12.6, or 0.4 , a 5.3 decrease from our Argentina operations, which were deemed to be highly inflationary, and unfavorable impact of currency of 40.9, or 1.4 . Segment sales results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 are as follows: 
 
 Batteries Lights net sales declined 3.4 versus the prior fiscal year, which included organic net sales decline of 1.0 . The organic decrease was driven by category declines from higher retail pricing and general economic conditions impacting category performance and weaker performance at several non-tracked customers (approximately 7.5 ), as well as from the planned exit of low margin business and a decline in our sales to device manufacturers due to their delay of new product launches and fourth quarter lost battery distribution in international markets (approximately 1.5 ). This was partially offset by the continued benefits of global pricing actions (approximately 8.0 ). 
 
 Auto Care net sales declined 1.3 versus the prior fiscal year, which was primarily driven by organic net sales decline of 1.1 . The organic decrease in Net sales was due to lower volumes from category declines from higher retail pricing and general economic conditions impacting category performance, cooler spring weather negatively impacting our refrigerant sales, and retailer inventory management (approximately 8.0 ). This was partially offset by the continued benefits of global pricing actions (approximately 7.0 ). 
 
 Total net sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 increased 0.9 , due to organic sales increase of 
 94.4, or 3.1 , and an 11.9 increase from our Argentina operations, which were deemed to be highly inflationary. Partially 
 offsetting these increases was the decrease in sales from exiting the Russian market of 19.3, or 0.6 , and unfavorable 
 impact of currency of 58.4, or 2.0 . Segment sales results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 are as follows: 
 
 Batteries Lights net sales improved 1.0 versus the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily driven by organic net sales growth of 3.5 due to pricing increases (approximately 7.5 and new distribution in battery lights (approximately 0.5 ). This was partially offset by the expected decline in battery demand compared to the elevated COVID-19 related sales in the prior year period (approximately 4.5 ). 
 41 

Auto Care net sales improved 0.7 versus the prior fiscal year. This increase was driven by organic net sales growth of 1.6 due to global price increases (approximately 8.0 and new distribution in both the North American and International markets (approximately 1.5 ). This was offset by a decrease in volumes to prior year related to the previously mentioned pricing actions, the lapping of elevated demand in the prior year and the negative impact higher gas prices had on miles driven, consumer foot traffic in the category, and a tendency to defer auto maintenance, particularly impacting our AC recharge business (approximately 8.0 ).

 Refer to Note 9, Segments, in the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation from segment profit to Earnings/(loss) before income taxes. 
 
 Total segment profit in fiscal 2023 was 626.5, an increase of 4.4 versus the prior fiscal year. The increase was driven by organic segment profit increase of 8.5 . This was partially offset by unfavorable movement in foreign currency of 22.0, or 3.7 , the change in Russian operating profit of 1.2 from exiting the Russian market and a decline of 1.4, or 0.2 , in Argentina operations. Segment operating profit results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 are as follows: 
 
 Battery Lights segment profit was 551.5, a decrease of 0.4 versus the prior fiscal year primarily driven by unfavorable currency movements. Offsetting this was organic profit increase of 21.5, or 3.9 . The growth was driven by improved operating margins driven by Project Momentum initiatives and decreased overhead and R D spending. This growth was partially offset by lower organic sales as well as higher A P spending in the current year. 
 
 Auto Care segment profit was 75.0, an increase of 28.5, or 61.3 , versus the prior fiscal year. Organic segment profit increased 29.5, or 63.4 . The growth was driven by improved operating margins driven by Project Momentum initiatives and decreased overhead spending. This growth was partially offset by lower organic sales as well as higher A P and R D spending in the current year. 
 
 Total segment profit in fiscal 2022 was 600.1, a decrease of 7.9 versus the prior fiscal year. The decline was 
 driven by organic segment profit decrease of 5.2 , unfavorable movement in foreign currency of 23.8, or 3.6 and the 
 42 

change in Russian operating profit of 4.0 from exiting the Russian market. These decreases were offset by 9.7, or 
 1.5 , of favorable changes in Argentina operations. Segment operating profit results for the twelve months ended 
 September 30, 2022 are as follows: 
 
 Battery Lights segment profit was 553.6, flat versus the prior fiscal year. The organic profit increase was 14.6, or 2.6 , and was driven by top-line growth and lower A P spending. This growth was partially offset by increased operating costs including higher labor, tariffs and transportation costs, which unfavorably impacted gross margin, as well as higher overhead spending. 
 
 Auto Care segment profit was 46.5, a decrease of 51.7, or 52.6 , versus the prior fiscal year. Organic segment profit decreased 48.2, or 49.1 . The organic revenue growth in Auto Care noted above was not enough to offset the increased product input costs which negatively impacted gross margin. Partially offsetting this decline was lower A P. 
 
 GENERAL CORPORATE For the Years Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2021 General corporate and other expenses 107.2 101.6 96.0 of net sales 3.6 3.3 3.2 
 
 For fiscal 2023, general corporate expenses were 107.2, an increase of 5.6 compared to fiscal 2022 expense of 101.6. The increase was driven by was primarily driven by increased factoring fees, higher mark to market expenses on our deferred compensation plans as well as increased stock compensation in the current year. For fiscal 2022, general corporate expenses were 101.6, an increase of 5.6 compared to fiscal 2021 expense of 96.0. The increase was driven by increased travel expense, and increased bonus and stock compensation expense, partially offset by lower mark to market expense on our deferred compensation plans. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Energizer s primary future cash needs are centered on operating activities, working capital and strategic investments. We believe that our future cash from operations, together with our access to capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund our short-term and long-term operating and financing needs. Our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to: (i) our financial condition and prospects, (ii) for debt, our credit rating, (iii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (iv) the current state of the economy. There can be no assurances that we will continue to have access to capital markets on terms acceptable to us. See Risk Factors for a further discussion. 
 
 Cash is managed centrally with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds. At September 30, 2023, Energizer had 223.3 of cash and cash equivalents, approximately 84 of which was outside of the U.S. Given our extensive international operations, a significant portion of our cash is denominated in foreign currencies. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences or be subject to regulatory capital requirements, however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations. 
 
 On December 22, 2020, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) which provided for a 5-year 400.0 revolving credit facility (2020 Revolving Facility) and a 1,200.0 Term Loan due December 2027. On December 31, 2021 the Company amended the Credit Agreement to increase the 2020 Revolving Facility to 500.0. 
 
 In February 2023, the Company amended this Credit Agreement and the existing interest rate swap to transition the interest reference rate from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to the Secured Overnight Finance Rate (SOFR). There were no other changes to the Company's Credit Agreement or timing of cash flows. The amendment was entered into because the LIBOR rate historically used was no longer published after June 30, 2023. The Company utilized expedients within ASC 848 to conclude that this amendment should be treated as a non-substantial modification of the existing contract, resulting in no impact to the Company's financial statement. 
 
 43 

The borrowings under the Term Loan require quarterly principal payments at a rate of 0.25 of the original principal balance. Borrowings under the 2020 Revolving Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of the Company, SOFR or the Base Rate (as defined) plus the applicable margin. The Term Loan bears interest at a rate per annum equal to SOFR plus the applicable margin. 
 
 During fiscal year 2023, the Company repurchased 16.3 of the 4.750 Senior Notes due in 2028 and 8.7 of the 4.375 Senior Notes due in 2029 at a total discount of 3.4. The Company also made early payments of 188.0 of the Term Loan. The extinguishment of this debt, less the write-off of associated deferred financing fees, resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 of 1.5. 
 
 As of September 30, 2023, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the 2020 Revolving Facility and 7.1 of outstanding letters of credit. Taking into account outstanding letters of credit, 492.9 remained available as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 Debt Covenants 
 
 The agreements governing the Company's debt contain certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and provisions relating to events of default. If the Company fails to comply with these covenants or with other requirements of these agreements, the lenders may have the right to accelerate the maturity of the debt. Acceleration under one of these facilities would trigger cross defaults to other borrowings. As of September 30, 2023, the Company was in compliance with the provisions and covenants associated with its debt agreements, and expects to remain in compliance for at least the next 12 months. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Cash flow from operating activities is the primary funding source for operating needs and capital investments. Cash flow from operating activities was 395.2 in fiscal 2023, 1.0 in fiscal 2022, and 179.7 in fiscal 2021. 
 
 Cash flow from operating activities was 395.2 in fiscal 2023 as compared to 1.0 in the prior fiscal year. This increase of 394.2 was primarily driven by working capital changes year over year of approximately 397.3 as the Company has worked to return to a more normalized working capital levels. The working capital change of approximately 397.3 was primarily a result of the following: 
 
 Approximately 105 is due to collections of accounts receivable in the current year compared to the prior year. The Company had reduced its factoring at the end of fiscal year 2022 compared to the prior year, which resulted in higher collections in fiscal 2023. This increase is partially offset by 55 million of changes in accrued sales allowance. 
 
 Approximately 227 of less inventory investment compared to the prior year as the Company was proactively building safety stock in the prior year and reduced the investment in the current year as inventory levels continued the return to a more normalized level; and 
 
 Approximately 131 due to changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities driven by timing of payments. 
 
 Cash flow from operating activities was 1.0 in fiscal 2022 as compared to 179.7 in fiscal 2021. This decrease of 178.7 was primarily driven by working capital changes year over year of approximately 165. The working capital change of approximately 165 was primarily a result of the following: 
 
 Approximately 195 in increased accounts receivable due to higher current year sales compared to prior year and reduced factoring relating to those accounts receivables, offset by approximately 29 of changes in accrued sales allowances. 
 
 Approximately 161 due to changes in accounts payable, offset by approximately 26 due to changes in accrued interest, both of which were driven by timing of payments. 
 
 These changes were partially offset by approximately 118 less of an inventory investment compared to the prior year as the Company was proactively building safety stock in the prior year and reduced the investment in the current year as inventory levels return to a more normalized level.

Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used by investing activities was 56.1 in fiscal 2023 and 90.9 in fiscal 2022, and 126.4 in fiscal 2021, and consisted of the following: 
 
 Capital expenditures were 56.8, 77.8, and 64.9 in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 
 
 Proceeds from asset sales were 0.7, 0.6, and 5.7 in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The fiscal 2021 proceeds primarily related to the sale of our Guatemala manufacturing facility acquired with the Battery Acquisition. 
 
 Acquisitions of intangible assets of 14.7 relating to the auto care appearance trade names and formulas acquired in Latin America during fiscal 2022. 
 
 Acquisitions, net of cash acquired and working capital payments, were an inflow of 1.0 in fiscal 2022, and an outflow of 67.2 in fiscal 2021. The fiscal 2022 inflow was from the Formulations Acquisition working capital settlement. The fiscal 2021 payments related to the acquired Indonesia battery plant and the Formulations Acquisition. 
 
 Investing cash outflows of approximately 95 to 105 are anticipated in fiscal 2024 for capital expenditures. This includes normal maintenance, product development and cost reduction investments, as well as approximately 35 to 45 of investment from Project Momentum initiatives including IT systems.

 Subsequent to the fiscal year end, on November 6, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 of 0.30 per share of common stock, payable on December 14, 2023, to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 29, 2023. 
 
 Share Repurchases 
 
 In November 2020, the Company's Board of Directors approved an authorization for Energizer to acquire up to 7.5 million shares of its common stock. The Company entered into a 75.0 accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Under the terms of the agreement, approximately 1.5 million shares were delivered in fiscal 2021 and an additional 0.5 million were delivered upon termination of the agreement on November 18, 2021. The Company acquired in total approximately 2.0 million shares at an average weighted price of 38.30 under the ASR. No additional shares were repurchased in fiscal 2022 or 2023. 
 
 Future share repurchase, if any, would be made on the open market and the timing and the amount of any purchases will be determined by the Company based on its evaluation of the market conditions, capital allocation objectives, legal and regulatory requirements and other factors. Share repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 
 46 

On August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) which, among other changes, created a new corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) based on adjusted financial statement income and imposed a 1 excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. The effective date of these provisions was January 1, 2023. There was no impact on the Company in fiscal 2023 as no shares were repurchased. Any excise tax incurred on corporate stock repurchases will generally be recognized as part of the cost basis of the treasury stock acquired and not reported as part of income tax expense. 
 
 The timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to shareholders or repurchases of the Company s Common stock will fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors. The Board s decisions regarding the payment of dividends or repurchase of shares will depend on many factors, such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, covenants associated with certain of our debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 
 The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to fund its operations and meet its short-term and long-term obligations. The Company's material future obligations include the contractual and purchase commitments described below. 
 
 The Company has a contractual commitment to repay its long-term debt of 3,344.2 based on the defined terms of our debt agreements. Within the next twelve months, the company is obligated to pay 12.0 of this total debt. Our interest commitments based on the current debt balance and SOFR rate on drawn debt at September 30, 2023 is 769.6 with 150.3 expected within the next twelve months. The company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement that fixed the variable benchmark component (SOFR) on 700.0 of variable rate debt. Refer to Note 12 Debt for further details. 
 
 The Company has an obligation to pay a mandatory transition tax of 16.7 over the next three years. The first payment of 3.9 is due in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 
 Additionally, Energizer has material future purchase commitments for goods and services which are legally binding and that specify all significant terms including price and/or quantity. Total future commitments for these obligations over the next 5 years is 8.3. Of this amount, 4.3 is due within the next twelve months. Refer to Note 17 Other Commitments and Contingencies for further details. Energizer is also party to various service and supply contracts that generally extend approximately one to three months. These arrangements are primarily individual, short-term purchase orders for routine goods and services at market prices, which are part of our normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. These contracts can generally be canceled at our option at any time. We do not believe such arrangements will adversely affect our liquidity position. 
 
 Finally, Energizer has operating and financing leases for real estate, equipment, and other assets that include future minimum payments with initial terms of one year or more. Total future operating and finance lease payments at September 30, 2023 are 145.2 and 66.2, respectively. Within the next twelve months, operating and finance lease payments are expected to be 20.4 and 2.5, respectively. Refer to Note 10 Leases for further details. 
 
 Other Matters 
 
 Environmental Matters 
 
 The operations of Energizer are subject to various federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations intended to protect the public health and the environment. These regulations relate primarily to worker safety, air and water quality, underground fuel storage tanks and waste handling and disposal. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, Energizer has been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) and may be required to share in the cost of cleanup with respect to certain federal Superfund sites. It may also be required to share in the cost of cleanup with respect to state-designated sites or other sites outside of the U.S. 
 
 Accrued environmental costs at September 30, 2023 were 14.0, of which approximately 3.9 is expected to be spent during fiscal 2024. It is difficult to quantify with certainty the cost of environmental matters, particularly remediation and future capital expenditures for environmental control equipment. Current environmental spending estimates could be modified as a result of changes in our plans or our understanding of underlying facts, changes in legal requirements or the enforcement or interpretation of existing requirements. 
 
 47 

Legal Proceedings 
 
 The Company and its affiliates are subject to a number of legal proceedings in various jurisdictions arising out of its operations. Many of these legal matters are in preliminary stages and involve complex issues of law and fact, and may proceed for protracted periods of time. The amount of liability, if any, from these proceedings cannot be determined with certainty. We are a party to legal proceedings and claims that arise during the ordinary course of business. We review our legal proceedings and claims, regulatory reviews and inspections on an ongoing basis and follow appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions. We establish accruals for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and we disclose the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, if such disclosure is necessary for our financial statements to not be misleading. We do not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated. Based upon present information, the Company believes that its liability, if any, arising from such pending legal proceedings, asserted legal claims and known potential legal claims which are likely to be asserted, is not reasonably likely to be material to the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, taking into account established accruals for estimated liabilities. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The methods, estimates, and judgments Energizer uses in applying its most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results the Company reports in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Specific areas, among others, requiring the application of management s estimates and judgment include assumptions pertaining to accruals for consumer and trade-promotion programs, pension benefit costs, acquisition, intangible assets and goodwill, uncertain tax positions, the reinvestment of undistributed foreign earnings and tax valuation allowances. On an ongoing basis, Energizer evaluates its estimates, but actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 
 
 The Company's critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. A summary of Energizer s significant accounting policies is contained in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of Energizer s accounting policies. 
 
 Revenue Recognition - The Company measures revenue as the amount of consideration for which it expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods. Net sales reflect the transaction prices for agreements, which include units shipped at selling list prices reduced by variable consideration as determined by the terms of each individual agreement. Discounts are offered to customers for early payment and an estimate of the discount is recorded as a reduction of net sales in the same period as the sale. Our standard sales terms generally include payments within 30 to 60 days and are final with returns or exchanges not permitted unless a special exception is made. Our Auto Care channel terms are longer, in some cases up to 365 days, in which case we use our trade receivables factoring program for more timely collection. Reserves are established based on historical data and recorded in cases where the right of return does exist for a particular sale. The Company does not offer warranties on products. 
 
 Energizer offers a variety of programs, primarily to its retail customers, designed to promote sales of its products. Such programs require periodic payments and allowances based on estimated results of specific programs and are recorded as a reduction to net sales. Methodologies for determining these provisions are dependent on specific customer pricing and promotional practices, which range from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to reimbursement based on actual occurrence or performance. Where applicable, future reimbursements are estimated based on a combination of historical patterns and future expectations regarding specific in-market product performance. Energizer accrues, at the time of sale, the estimated total payments and allowances associated with each transaction. Customers redeem trade promotions in the form of payments from the accrued trade allowances or invoice credits against trade receivables. Additionally, Energizer offers programs directly to consumers to promote the sale of its products. Energizer continually assesses the adequacy of accruals for customer and consumer promotional program costs not yet paid. To the extent total program payments differ from estimates, adjustments may be necessary. Historically, these adjustments have not been material. 
 
 The Company s agreements with customers do not have significant financing components or non-cash consideration and the Company does not have unbilled revenue or significant amounts of prepayments from customers. Revenue is recorded net of the taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities which are generally included in the price to the customer. Shipping and handling activities are accounted for as contract fulfillment costs and recorded in Cost of products sold. 
 
 48 

Pension Plans - The determination of the Company s obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent on certain assumptions developed by the Company and used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. Assumptions include, among others, the discount rate, future salary increases and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Actual results that differ from assumptions made, or impacts to the obligation that are due to changes to assumptions, are recognized on the balance sheet and subsequently amortized to earnings over future periods. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in macroeconomic conditions resulting in changes to assumptions may materially affect pension obligations. In determining the discount rate, the Company uses the yield on high-quality bonds in conjunction with the cash flows of its plans estimated payouts. For the U.S. plans, which were frozen January 1, 2014 and represent the Company s most significant obligations, we consider the Mercer Above-Mean yield curve in determining the discount rates. 
 
 Of the assumptions listed above, changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and changes in the discount rate used in developing plan obligations will likely have the most significant impact on the Company s annual earnings, prospectively. Based on plan assets at September 30, 2023, a 100 basis point decrease or increase in expected asset returns would increase or decrease the Company s U.S. pre-tax pension expense by 2.6. In addition, poor asset performance may increase and accelerate the rate of required pension contributions in the future. Uncertainty related to economic markets and the availability of credit may produce changes in the yields on corporate bonds rated as high-quality. As a result, discount rates based on high-quality corporate bonds may increase or decrease leading to lower or higher, respectively, pension obligations. A 100 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase U.S. pension obligations by 18.5 at September 30, 2023. 
 
 As allowed under GAAP, the Company s U.S. qualified pension plan's impact on earnings is determined using Market Related Value, which recognizes market appreciation or depreciation in the portfolio over five years and therefore reduces the short-term impact of market fluctuations. 
 
 Business Combinations - The Company allocates the cost of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The Company uses a variety of information sources to determine the value of acquired assets and liabilities including: third-party appraisers for the values and lives of property, identifiable intangibles and inventories; actuaries for defined benefit retirement plans; and legal counsel or other advisors to assess the obligations associated with legal, environmental or other claims. The excess value of the cost of an acquired business over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. 
 
 During fiscal 2021, Energizer used variations of the income approach in determining the fair value of the amortizable intangible assets acquired for the Formulations Acquisition. The Company utilized multi-period excess earnings methods for determining the fair value of the proprietary technology and customer relationships acquired. Our determination of the fair value of these assets involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions related to the revenue growth rates and discount rates. Our determination of the fair value of customer relationships also involved assumptions related to customer attrition rates. 
 
 Intangible Assets - Significant judgment is required in assigning the respective useful lives of intangible assets. Certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other intangible assets are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment of intangible assets that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including the competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are primarily based on the same factors. The carrying value of determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over the estimated useful life. The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. The Company assesses the appropriateness of an indefinite life being assigned to certain intangible assets as a part of this annual impairment analysis. The useful life of a determinable-lived intangible asset would be reassessed if a triggering event was identified that indicated a potential change in the value or use of our determinable-lived assets. A change in the useful life of these assets could have a material impact on our financial statements. 
 
 The Company has certain trade names with indefinite lives that are reviewed for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year following the annual forecasting process, or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate the trade name may be impaired. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. However, the Company can elect not to perform the 
 49 

qualitative assessment, and is then required to perform a quantitative impairment test that involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. 
 
 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company completed the indefinite lived intangibles annual assessment. A quantitative assessment was performed over the Rayovac and Armor All trade names due to the prior year impairments, and a qualitative assessment was performed over the Energizer, Eveready and Varta trade names. No impairment were identified and the Armor All trade name fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 20 . 
 
 For Rayovac, the fair value of the trade name exceeded its carrying value of 422.2 by approximately 5 . The quantitative estimate of fair value for the Rayovac trade name was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method, which requires significant assumptions, including estimates related to revenue growth rates, gross margin rates, operating expenses (SG A, R D, and A P) and discount rates. The projections for the Rayovac fair value model were generated using the Company s three-year strategic plan, the Company's annual budget plan for fiscal 2024, and long-term category projections, to determine forecasted cash flows and operating data. Specifically, the revenue growth assumption was based on historical trends and management s expectations for future category trends. The gross margin rate assumption was based on historical trends, management's cost cutting strategies and a market place participant's production capabilities. The gross margin rate utilized was also consistent with rates achieved in fiscal 2023. Operating expenses are based on historical trends and management's annual budget plan for fiscal 2024, as well as long-term operating and advertising strategies. The discount rate used was based on a weighted-average cost of capital utilizing industry market data of similar companies. Changes in the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the Rayovac tradename could result in impairment charges in future periods, which could be material. Specifically, a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate would have resulted in the carrying value of the Rayovac trade name exceeding the fair value by approximately 0.6 . 
 
 In fiscal 2022, a quantitative assessment was performed over the Armor All, STP and Rayovac trade names, resulting in non-cash impairments of 370.4, 26.3 and 127.8, respectively. For Armor All and STP, the non-cash impairments were primarily due to declines in their respective Auto Care category projections late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, significant increases in input costs, and a higher discount rate. The Rayovac non-cash impairment was primarily caused by significant sustained currency headwinds in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which were expected to continue into fiscal 2023 and were included within the cash flow models, a decrease in the branded sales forecast, increases in input costs, and a higher discount rate. The quantitative estimated fair values were determined using the multi-period excess earnings method, which requires significant assumptions for each brand, including estimates related to revenue growth rates, gross margin rates, operating expenses (SG A, R D and A P), and discount rates. The projections for the Armor All, STP and Rayovac fair value models were generated using the Company s three-year strategic plan, the Company's annual budget plan for fiscal 2023, and long-term category projections, to determine forecasted cash flows and operating data. Specifically, revenue growth assumptions were based on historical trends and management s expectations for future growth by brand and category. Gross margin rate assumptions were based on historical trends and management's cost cutting strategies. Operating expenses were based on historical trends and management's annual budget plan for fiscal 2023, as well as long-term operating and advertising strategies. The discount rates used in the trade name fair value estimates ranged between 9.5 and 10.0 , and were based on a weighted-average cost of capital utilizing industry market data of similar companies. The new carrying values for Armor All, STP, and Rayovac trade names were 228.5, 76.4, and 422.2, respectively. 
 
 STP is within the fuel and oil additives category and due to the expectation for an increased percentage of electric vehicles in the car parc over the long term, the Company converted the STP trade name into a definite-life intangible asset with a 25 year useful life. This conversion resulted in additional annual pre-tax amortization expense of approximately 3.0 which was included in Amortization of intangible assets expense in fiscal 2023. 
 
 Changes in the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets could result in additional impairment charges in future periods, which could be material. Additionally, certain factors have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, which could also result in material impairment charges. These factors include (i) failure to achieve forecasted revenue growth rates, (ii) failure to achieve cost cutting and margin improvement initiatives the Company is implementing, (iii) failure to meet forecasted operating expenses, or (iv) increases in the discount rate. 
 
 For the year ended September 30, 2022, a qualitative analysis was performed over the Energizer, Eveready and Varta trade names and no impairments were identified. 
 
 For the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company completed a qualitative annual impairment assessment and no impairments were identified. 
 
 50 

Goodwill - In fiscal 2022, the Company changed its reportable segments and correspondingly reallocated goodwill to the current reporting units: Battery Lights North America, Battery Lights International, Auto Care North America and Auto Care International. The Company performed an assessment of goodwill at October 1, 2021 before the change in segments, noting no impairments identified. Goodwill was reallocated to the reporting units based on the relative fair value of each reporting unit on October 1, 2021. 
 
 The Company completes its annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth fiscal quarter each year over each of these reporting units. When performing a quantitative analysis the Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit under the income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow model which incorporates significant estimates and assumptions, including future cash flows driven by revenue and gross margin projections and discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows. The Company uses the three-year strategic plan, the annual budget plan for the following fiscal year, and long-term category projections, to determine forecasted cash flows and operating data for the discounted cash flow model. Specifically, revenue growth assumptions are based on historical trends and management s expectations for future growth by category. Gross margin rate assumptions are based on historical trends and management's cost cutting strategies. The discount rates are based on a weighted-average cost of capital utilizing industry market data of similar companies. 
 
 In fiscal 2023, the Company completed a quantitative analysis on the Auto Care North America reporting unit and a qualitative analysis over the Battery Lights reporting units. No impairments were identified and the Auto Care North America reporting unit's fair value exceed its carrying value by more than 20 . 
 
 In fiscal 2022, the Company completed a quantitative analysis on all four reporting units. As a part of the annual assessment, the Company identified a non-cash impairment of the Auto Care International reporting unit of 17.4. This non-cash impairment was primarily driven by significant sustained currency headwinds in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which were expected to continue into fiscal 2023 and were included within the cash flow models, declines in the Auto Care category projections late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, and an increased discount rate. There was no remaining goodwill allocated to this reporting unit after the non-cash impairment. 
 
 In fiscal 2022, the Battery Lights reporting units estimated fair value exceeded their carrying values by more than 100 . The estimated fair value of the Auto Care North America reporting unit, which has a total of 134.2 of goodwill, exceeded its carrying value by 12 . Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of significant judgment, estimates and assumptions. Changes in the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units could result in impairment charges in future periods. Additionally, certain factors have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair values of our reporting units, which also could result in impairment charges. These factors include (i) failure to achieve forecasted revenue growth rates, (ii) failure to achieve cost cutting and margin improvement initiatives the Company is implementing, or (iii) increases in the discount rate. An increase in discount rates, a reduction in projected cash flows or a combination of the two could lead to a reduction in the estimated fair values, which may result in impairment charges that could materially impact our financial statements in any given year. 
 
 While the Company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable, these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized, and also on the magnitude of any such charge. The results of an impairment analysis are as of a point in time. There is no assurance that actual future earnings or cash flows of the reporting units will not decline significantly from these projections. The Company will monitor any changes to these assumptions and will evaluate goodwill as deemed warranted during future periods. 
 
 For the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company completed a qualitative annual impairment assessment and no impairments were identified. 
 
 Income Taxes - The Company's annual effective income tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
 
 The Company estimates income taxes and the effective income tax rate in each jurisdiction that it operates. This involves estimating taxable earnings, specific taxable and deductible items, the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets, the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to 
 51 

be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable and possible exposures related to future tax audits. Deferred tax assets are evaluated on a subsidiary by subsidiary basis to ensure that the asset will be realized. Valuation allowances are established when the realization is not deemed to be more likely than not. Future performance is monitored, and when objectively measurable operating trends change, adjustments are made to the valuation allowances accordingly. To the extent the estimates described above change, adjustments to income taxes are made in the period in which the estimate is changed. 
 
 In determining whether a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets are warranted, the Company assesses all available positive and negative evidence such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry-back and carry-forward periods and the feasibility of ongoing tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset. After the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence, the conclusion was that it is more likely than not that the Company will generate enough future taxable income to realize the U.S. net deferred tax asset on its balance sheet as of September 30, 2023. The Company will continue to regularly assess the potential for realization of net deferred tax assets in future periods. Changes in future earnings projections, among other factors, may result in a valuation allowance against some or all of the net deferred tax assets, which may materially impact income tax expense in the period if it is determined that these factors have changed. 
 
 The Company operates in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax and regulatory environments, which are subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the taxing authorities. At times, we may take positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenges by the appropriate taxing authority. The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities in accordance with guidance governing accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The Company reviews these tax uncertainties in light of the changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjusts them accordingly. The Company's policy on accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income is to treat the taxes due as a period expense when incurred. 
 
 In general, it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and repatriate earnings only when the tax impact is zero or very minimal. No provision has been provided for taxes that would result upon repatriation of our foreign investments to the United States. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries to fund local operations, fund strategic growth objectives, and fund capital projects. See Note 6, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04 Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. Subsequent to the issuance of ASU 2020-04, ASC 848 was amended by ASU 2021-01 Scope, and ASU 2022-06 Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 (collectively ASC 848). Topic 848 provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR. These updates are effective immediately and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated on or before December 31, 2024. The Company adopted the provisions of these updates on October 1, 2022 and applied the guidance prospectively to contract modifications that were entered into for the purpose of establishing a new reference rate during fiscal 2023. Refer to Notes 12 and 16 for additional information. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact to the Company's financial statements. 

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Positions 
 
 The market risk inherent in the Company's financial instruments positions represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in currency rates, commodity prices and interest rates. The following risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur. The Company's derivatives are used only for identifiable exposures, and we have not entered into hedges for trading purposes where the sole objective is to generate profits. 
 
 52 

Currency Exposure 
 
 Our business is conducted on a worldwide basis, with approximately 40 of our sales in fiscal 2023 arising from foreign countries, and a significant portion of our production capacity and cash located overseas. Consequently, we are subject to currency risks associated with doing business in foreign countries. Currency risk is heightened in areas with political or economic instability such as the Eurozone, Egypt, Russia and the Middle East and certain markets in Latin America. A significant portion of our sales are denominated in local currencies but reported in U.S. dollars, and a high percentage of product costs for such sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Therefore, although we may hedge a portion of the exposure, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to such currencies can negatively impact our reported sales and operating profits. The following discussion describes programs in place to mitigate our foreign currency exposure: 
 
 Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedging Relationships 
 
 A significant share of Energizer's product cost is more closely tied to the U.S. dollar than to the local currencies in which the product is sold. As such, a weakening of currencies relative to the U.S. dollar results in margin declines unless mitigated through pricing actions, which are not always available due to the economic or competitive environment. Conversely, strengthening of currencies relative to the U.S. dollar can improve margins. The primary currencies to which Energizer is exposed include the Euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. However, the Company also has significant exposures in many other currencies which, in the aggregate, may have a material impact on the Company's operations. 
 
 The Company has entered into a series of forward currency contracts to hedge the cash flow uncertainty of forecasted inventory purchases due to currency fluctuations. Energizer s primary foreign affiliates, which are exposed to U.S. dollar purchases, have the Euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar as their local currencies. These foreign currencies represent a significant portion of Energizer's foreign currency exposure. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, Energizer had an unrealized pre-tax gain of 3.3 and 16.3, respectively, on these forward currency contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Assuming foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar remain at September 30, 2023 levels, over the next twelve months, 3.0 of the pre-tax gain included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss is expected to be included in earnings. 
 
 Derivatives Not Designated as Cash Flow Hedging Relationships 
 
 Energizer's foreign subsidiaries enter into internal and external transactions that create nonfunctional currency balance sheet positions at the foreign subsidiary level. These exposures are generally the result of intercompany purchases, intercompany loans and to a lesser extent, external purchases, and are revalued in the foreign subsidiary s local currency at the end of each period. Changes in the value of the non-functional currency balance sheet positions in relation to the foreign subsidiary s local currency results in an exchange gain or loss recorded in Other items, net on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. The primary currency to which Energizer s foreign subsidiaries are exposed is the U.S. dollar. 
 
 The Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts which are not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes to hedge balance sheet exposures. Any gains or losses on these contracts would be offset by corresponding exchange gains or losses on the underlying exposures; thus they are not subject to significant market risk. The change in estimated fair value of the foreign currency contracts for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 resulted in a loss of 2.0 and was recorded in Other items, net on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. 
 
 Commodity Price Exposure 
 
 The Company uses raw materials that are subject to price volatility. The Company has in the past and may in the future use hedging instruments to reduce exposure to variability in cash flows associated with future purchases of certain materials and commodities. 
 
 In February 2019, the Company entered a hedging program on zinc purchases. This program was determined to 
 be a cash flow hedge and qualified for hedge accounting. The unrealized pre-tax loss on the zinc contracts was 0.7 and 6.1 at September 30, 2023 and 2022. These were included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 53 

Interest Rate Exposure 
 
 The Company has interest rate risk with respect to interest expense on variable rate debt. At September 30, 2023, Energizer had variable rate debt outstanding with a principal balance of 990.2 under the 2020 Term Loans and international borrowings. There were no outstanding borrowings on the 2020 Revolving Credit Facility at September 30, 2023. 
 
 In December 2020, the Company entered into an interest rate swap (2020 interest rate swap) with an effective date of December 22, 2020, that fixed the variable benchmark component (LIBOR) at an interest rate of 0.95 on variable debt of 550.0. The notional value increased to 700.0 on January 22, 2021 and will stay at that value through December 22, 2024. The notional value will decrease by 100.0 on December 22, 2024 and by 100.0 each year thereafter until its termination date on December 22, 2027. 
 
 In February 2023, the Company amended its Credit Agreement to transition the interest reference rate from LIBOR to SOFR. The amendment was entered into because the LIBOR rate historically used was no longer published after June 30, 2023. The Company also amended the 2020 Interest rate swap to coincide with the amended credit agreement, effectively fixing the variable benchmark component (SOFR) at an interest rate of 1.042 . There were no other changes to the interest rate swap agreement or expected timing of cash flows associated with the swap. The Company utilized expedients within ASC 848 to conclude that this modification should be accounted for as a continuation of the existing swap agreement, resulting in no impact on the Company's financial statements. 
 
 The pre-tax gain recognized on this interest rate swap was 79.8 and 86.4 as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These were included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
 For the year ended September 30, 2023, our weighted average interest rate on variable rate debt was 4.59 . 
 
 Argentina Currency Exposure and Hyperinflation 
 
 Effective July 1, 2018, the financial statements for our Argentina subsidiary were consolidated under the rules governing the translation of financial information in a highly inflationary economy. Under U.S. GAAP, an economy is considered highly inflationary if the cumulative inflation rate for a three year period meets or exceeds 100 percent. The Argentina economy exceeded the three year cumulative inflation rate of 100 percent as of June 2018, and remains highly inflationary as of September 30, 2023. If a subsidiary is considered to be in a highly inflationary economy, the financial statements of the subsidiary must be remeasured into the Company s reporting currency (U.S. dollar) and future exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in current earnings, rather than exclusively in the equity section of the balance sheet, until such time as the economy is no longer considered highly inflationary. It is difficult to determine what continuing impact the use of highly inflationary accounting for Argentina may have on our consolidated financial statements as such impact is dependent upon movements in the applicable exchange rates between the local currency and the U.S. dollar and the amount of monetary assets and liabilities included in our affiliates' balance sheet.

 To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Energizer Holdings, Inc. 
 
 Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Energizer Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, of shareholders equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
 
 In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. 
 
 Basis for Opinions 
 
 The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
 
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
 
 56 

Critical Audit Matters 
 
 The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
 
 Revenue Recognition - Trade Promotion Programs 
 
 As described in Notes 2 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, Energizer offers a variety of programs, primarily to its retail customers, designed to promote sales of its products. These programs resulted in an allowance for trade promotions of 174.0 million, which is reflected as a reduction in trade receivables, net and 52.7 million of accrued trade promotions within other current liabilities as of September 30, 2023. Such programs require periodic payments and allowances based on estimated results of specific programs and are recorded as a reduction to net sales. Methodologies for determining these provisions are dependent on specific customer pricing and promotional practices, which range from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to reimbursement based on actual occurrence or performance. Where applicable, future reimbursements are estimated based on a combination of historical patterns and future expectations regarding specific in-market product performance. Management accrues, at the time of sale, the estimated total payments and allowances associated with each transaction. Customers redeem trade promotions in the form of payments from the accrued trade allowances or invoice credits against trade receivables. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition for trade promotion programs is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the estimated allowance for trade promotions and accrued trade promotions and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s significant assumptions related to historical patterns and future expectations regarding specific in-market product performance. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the completeness, accuracy, and valuation of the estimated allowance for trade promotions and accrued trade promotions. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management s process for developing the estimated allowance for trade promotions and accrued trade promotions; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the methods used by management; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the estimates; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to historical patterns and future expectations regarding specific in-market product performance. Evaluating management s significant assumptions related to historical patterns and future expectations regarding specific in-market product performance involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the historical performance of similar trade programs; (ii) testing payments and invoice credits related to these trade programs on a sample basis; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. 
 
 Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Annual Impairment Assessment - Rayovac Trade Name 
 
 As described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s indefinite-lived intangible assets balance was 762.8 million as of September 30, 2023, of which the carrying value for the Rayovac trade name was 422.2 million. Intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life are not amortized, but are reviewed annually for impairment of value or when indicators of a potential impairment are present. A quantitative assessment was performed over the Rayovac trade name, and the quantitative estimate of fair value was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method, which requires significant assumptions, including estimates related to revenue growth rates, gross margin rates, operating expenses, and discount rates. 
 
 The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment for the Rayovac trade name is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the Rayovac trade name; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management s significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates, gross margin rates, operating expenses, and discount rates; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 
 
 Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management s indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Rayovac 
 57 

trade name. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management s process for developing the fair value estimate of the Rayovac trade name; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings method used by management; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the multi-period excess earnings method; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to revenue growth rates, gross margin rates, operating expenses, and discount rates. Evaluating management s significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates, gross margin rates, and operating expenses involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the brand; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings method and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rates assumption.

 Segment performance is evaluated based on segment operating profit, exclusive of general corporate expenses (including share-based compensation costs), Project Momentum restructuring and related charges, acquisition and integration activities, acquisition earn out, amortization of intangibles, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, the costs of the flooding of our manufacturing facility in Brazil, the costs of exiting the Russian market, and other items determined to be corporate in nature. Financial items, such as interest income and expense, (gain)/loss on extinguishment of debt, settlement loss on U.S. pension annuity buy out, and gain on finance lease termination are managed on a global basis at the corporate level. The exclusion of these costs from segment results reflects management s view on how it evaluates segment performance.

This non-cash impairment was primarily driven by significant sustained currency headwinds in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which were expected to continue into fiscal 2023 and were included within the cash flow models, declines in the Auto Care category projections late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, and an increased discount rate. There is no remaining goodwill allocated to this reporting unit after the non-cash impairment. This fair value measurement fell within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, see Note 16, Financial Instruments and Risk Management. 
 
 In fiscal 2022, the Battery Lights reporting units estimated fair value exceeded their carrying values by more than . The estimated fair value of the Auto Care North America reporting unit, which has a total of of goodwill, exceeded its carrying value by . Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of significant judgment, estimates and assumptions. Changes in the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the Company's goodwill reporting units could result in impairment charges in future periods, which could be material. Additionally, certain factors have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, which also could result in material impairment charges. These factors include (i) failure to achieve forecasted revenue growth rates, (ii) failure to achieve cost cutting and margin improvement initiatives the Company is implementing, or (iii) increases in the discount rate. 
 
 For the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company completed a qualitative annual impairment assessment and no impairments were identified. 
 
 Indefinite-lived Intangible Asset Annual Impairment Analysis 
 
 During the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, the Company completes impairment testing on indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill, which are trademarks/brand names used in the various battery, auto care and lighting product categories. 
 
 For fiscal 2023, a quantitative assessment was performed over the Rayovac and Armor All trade names due to the prior year impairments, and a qualitative assessment was performed over the Energizer, Eveready and Varta trade names. No impairments were identified and the Armor All trade name fair value exceed its carrying value by more than . 
 
 For Rayovac, the fair value of the trade name exceeded its carrying value of by approximately . The quantitative estimate of fair value for the Rayovac trade name was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method, which requires significant assumptions, including estimates related to revenue growth rates, gross margin rates, operating expenses (SG A, R D, and A P) and discount rates. The projections for the Rayovac fair value model were generated using the Company s three-year strategic plan, the Company's annual budget plan for fiscal 2024, and long-term category projections, to determine forecasted cash flows and operating data. Specifically, the revenue growth assumption was based on historical trends and management s expectations for future category trends. The gross margin rate assumption was based on historical trends, management's cost cutting strategies, and a market place participant's production capabilities. The gross margin rate utilized is consistent with rates achieved in fiscal 2023. Operating expenses are based on historical trends and management's annual budget plan for fiscal 2024, as well as long-term operating and advertising strategies. The discount rate used was based on a weighted-average cost of capital utilizing industry market data of similar companies.

, , and , respectively. For Armor All and STP, the non-cash impairments were primarily due to declines in their respective Auto Care category projections late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, significant increases in input costs, and a higher discount rate. The Rayovac non-cash impairment was primarily caused by significant sustained currency headwinds in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which were expected to continue into fiscal 2023 and were included within the cash flow models, a decrease in the branded sales forecast, increases in input costs, and a higher discount rate. 
 
 The quantitative estimated fair values were determined using the multi-period excess earnings method, which requires significant assumptions for each brand, including estimates related to revenue growth rates, gross margin rates, operating expenses (SG A, R D, and A P) and discount rates. The projections for our Armor All, STP and Rayovac fair value models were generated using the company s three-year strategic plan, the Company's annual budget plan for fiscal 2023, and long-term category projections to determine forecasted cash flows and operating data.

 The investment objective for plan assets is to satisfy the current and future pension benefit obligations. The investment philosophy is to achieve this objective through diversification of the retirement plan assets. The goal is to earn a suitable return with an appropriate level of risk while maintaining adequate liquidity to distribute benefit payments. The diversified asset allocation includes equity positions, as well as fixed income investments. The increased volatility associated with equities is offset with higher expected returns, while the long duration fixed income investments help dampen the volatility of the overall portfolio. Risk exposure is controlled by re-balancing the retirement plan assets back to target allocations, as needed. Investment firms managing retirement plan assets carry out investment policy within their stated guidelines. Investment performance is monitored against benchmark indices, which reflect the policy and target allocation of the retirement plan assets.

 Legal Proceedings The Company and its affiliates are subject to a number of legal proceedings in various jurisdictions arising out of its operations. Many of these legal matters are in preliminary stages and involve complex issues of law and fact, and may proceed for protracted periods of time. The amount of liability, if any, from these proceedings cannot be determined with certainty. The Company and its affiliates are a party to legal proceedings and claims that arise during the ordinary course of business. The Company reviews its legal proceedings and claims, regulatory reviews and inspections on an ongoing basis and follows appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions. The Company establishes accruals for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and discloses the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, if such disclosure is necessary for our financial statements to not be misleading. The Company does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated. Based upon present information, the Company believes that its liability, if any, arising from such pending legal proceedings, asserted legal claims and known potential legal claims which are likely to be asserted, is not reasonably likely to be material to the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, taking into account established accruals for estimated liabilities.

 a. All payments and benefits provided hereunder shall be subject to tax withholdings required by applicable law and other standard payroll deductions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any amounts payable in accordance with this Agreement are subject to Section 409A, this Agreement shall be interpreted and administered in such a way as to comply with the applicable provisions of Section 409A to the maximum extent possible.

Section 409A. Colleague shall not have the ability to control, directly or indirectly, the timing of any payments of deferred compensation subject to Section 409A.

In addition and solely to the extent required by Section 409A, no payments that are deferred compensation subject to Section 409A will be made to Colleague prior to the earlier of (a) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of Colleague s separation from service (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations issued under Section 409A) or (b) the date of Colleague s death, if Colleague is deemed at the time of her separation from service to be a specified employee within the meaning of that term under Section 409A(a)(2) of the Code and to the extent such delayed commencement is otherwise required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2) of the Code. All payments and benefits which had been delayed pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be paid (without interest) to Colleague in a lump sum upon expiration of such six-month period (or if earlier upon Colleague s death). Each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided under this Agreement shall be construed as a separate and distinct payment for purposes of Section 409A. 
 c. Colleague agrees that she shall be liable for the payment of all federal, state and local taxes which may be owed by Colleague as the result of the consideration described above. Colleague understands that Energizer makes no representations regarding tax treatment of the payments, and Colleague agrees fully to defend, indemnify and hold Energizer, and each of its parents, subsidiaries, divisions, affiliates and operating companies, and the respective officers, directors, employees, agents and affiliates of each of them, harmless from any liability for payment of the taxes, penalties, withholding obligations and interest that she owes on the consideration she receives and that a government agency requests that Energizer pay (other than any payroll tax amounts for which only the employer would be liable), and to cooperate with Energizer with respect to any tax issues related to the compensation payable under this Agreement. Energizer makes no representations that the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement comply with Section 409A and in no event shall Energizer be liable for all or any portion of any taxes, penalties, interest or other expenses that may be incurred by Colleague on account of non-compliance with Section 409A.

Colleague s breach of this Agreement will excuse Energizer from any further obligations under this Agreement. Colleague agrees a breach by Colleague of the Restrictive Covenants in this Agreement will cause irreparable damage to Energizer and, for that reason, Colleague further agrees Energizer shall be entitled as a matter of right to injunctive relief restraining any further violation by Colleague. The right to injunctive relief shall be cumulative and in addition to any and all other remedies Energizer may have, including, specifically, recovery of actual damages, as provided for above. In addition, if a Court of competent jurisdiction finds either party has broken their respective promises contained in this Agreement by filing a lawsuit or initiating or maintaining any other type of claim prohibited by this Agreement, the losing party agrees to pay for all costs incurred by the prevailing party, including reasonable attorneys fees, in defending against its claims. 
 27. Missouri Law Governs . Because of Energizer s and Colleague s substantial contacts with the State of Missouri, the fact that Energizer s headquarters is located in Missouri, the parties interests in ensuring that disputes regarding the interpretation, validity and enforceability of this Agreement are resolved on a uniform basis, and Energizer s execution of and making of this Agreement in Missouri, the parties agree that the Agreement shall be interpreted and governed by the laws of the State of Missouri, without regard for any conflict of law principles. Any action concerning this Agreement must be decided in a court of competent jurisdiction in St. Louis County, Missouri, with respect to a state court, or the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, with respect to a federal court.

28. Rule of Construction . The rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in interpreting this Agreement. The parties intend for this Agreement to satisfy the provisions of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, and this Agreement shall always be construed or limited in conformity with such provisions. 
 29. Modification or Severability of Agreement if Necessary . Colleague agrees that if any part of her promises or the duration of such promises in this agreement are determined to be too restrictive by a court of competent jurisdiction, the court may modify the promises and or duration to make the same reasonable under the circumstances, and Colleague acknowledges that both Colleague and Energizer will be bound by such modification. In case any of the provisions in this agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable-and cannot be modified-then such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect the other provisions of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed as if such provision had never been contained in the Agreement. However, if the release of all claims contained in this Agreement in any respect is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, then, at Energizer s option, Colleague shall be required (and promises and agrees) to repay to Energizer on demand, all amounts paid by Energizer pursuant to Section 5 (other than Accrued Amounts), and the parties shall revert to the position held by each prior to the signing of this Agreement. 
 30. Mutual Agreement for Modification . Unless modified by a court of competent jurisdiction which determines the agreement to be too restrictive, no term, condition, promise, representation or acknowledgement contained in this Agreement may be amended or modified unless in writing and signed by both Colleague and Energizer. 
 31. Assignment Successors . This Agreement will be binding on Colleague and her heirs, executors, administrators and other legal representatives and will be binding on Energizer and its successors and assigns. This Agreement, and all of the rights granted in this agreement, will be freely assignable by Energizer.

Colleague and Energizer acknowledge that any post-employment obligations toward Energizer contained in any agreements signed by Colleague before or during her employment with Energizer remain in full force and effect, and that any post-employment obligations created by this Agreement are in addition to any of Colleague s postemployment obligations contained in any other agreements. 
 34. No Reliance . The parties have not relied on any representations, promises or agreements of any kind made to them in connection with this Agreement, except for those set forth in the Agreement. 
 35. Knowing and Voluntary Agreement . Colleague hereby acknowledges that she has read and fully understands the terms of this Agreement and the effect of signing the same. Colleague further acknowledges that she is voluntarily entering into this Agreement. Colleague waives rights or claims only in exchange for consideration in addition to anything of value to which the Colleague already is entitled. 

36. Capacity to Settle . Colleague represents that she has no legal impediments (including bankruptcy proceedings) to fully and completely settle all claims and to sign this Agreement.

 Energizer Holdings, Inc. 
 Securities Trading Policy 
 Transactions in Company Securities Effective Date May 1, 2023 
 Supersedes August 1, 2022 

Section 1 Purpose of this Policy 
 As a publicly owned corporation, Energizer Holdings, Inc. (the Company is subject to various federal and state securities laws, including rules related to trading in the Company s securities and other public companies. These laws apply to each director, officer, colleague of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates in addition to any of their Related Persons (as defined below), whether or not located in or outside the United States. This policy also applies to the Company s agents and advisors (together with directors, officers, colleagues and their Related Persons, insiders ). 
 
 Questions regarding this policy should be directed to the Company s Legal Department. The Company reserves the right to amend and interpret the policy from time to time. 
 
 Section 2 Policy 
 If a director, officer, colleague, agent or advisor of the Company has material, nonpublic information relating to the Company, it is the Company s policy that neither that person nor any of his or her Related Persons may buy or sell the Company s securities or engage in any other action to take advantage of, or pass on to others, that information. This policy also applies to material, nonpublic information relating to any other company with publicly-traded securities, including our customers or suppliers, obtained in the course of employment by or association with the Company and or its subsidiaries and affiliates. It is also the policy of the Company that the Company will not engage in transactions in Company securities while aware of material nonpublic information relating to the Company or Company securities. 
 
 To avoid even the appearance of impropriety, additional restrictions on trading the Company s securities by Energizer Insiders (defined below) are set forth in Section 5. 
 
 Section 3 Definitions 
 A. Who is an Insider 
 Any person who possesses material, nonpublic information is considered an insider as to that information. Insiders include the Company s directors, officers, colleagues, agents, advisors and those persons in a special relationship with the Company (e.g., its auditors, consultants or attorneys). The definition of insider is transaction specific that is, an individual is an insider with respect to each item of material, nonpublic information of which he or she is aware. 
 
 B. What is Material Information 
 The materiality of information depends upon the circumstances. Information is considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in making a decision to buy, sell or hold a security or where the information is likely to affect the market price of the security. Material information can be positive or negative and can relate to virtually any aspect of the Company s business or to any type of Company security (i.e., debt or equity). 
 
 Some examples of material information include 
 Unpublished financial or operational results or projections, including earnings information 
 Pending or proposed mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions 
 Significant changes in corporate objectives 
 Significant acquisition or sale of assets 
 Changes in dividend or stock repurchase policies 
 Financial liquidity problems 
 Cybersecurity risks and incidents, including vulnerabilities and breaches. Insider trading restrictions may also pertain to the period of time the Company is investigating the underlying facts, ramifications and materiality of a cybersecurity incident. 
 News related to potential or actual litigation, disputes, or governmental investigations 
 News of a possible new significant customer or of a possible loss of a significant customer 
 News of significant changes in senior management or Board of Directors 
 Important product developments or major technological advances or discoveries

Energizer Holdings, Inc. 
 Securities Trading Policy 
 Transactions in Company Securities Effective Date May 1, 2023 
 Supersedes August 1, 2022 

The above list is only illustrative many other types of information may be considered material, depending on the circumstances. The materiality of particular information is subject to reassessment on a regular basis. If an insider is unsure whether particular nonpublic information is material, the insider should presume that it is material and consult with the Company s Legal Department. 
 
 C. What is Nonpublic Information 
 Information is nonpublic if it is not available to the general public. In order for information to be considered public, it must have been disclosed in the Company s public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or widely disseminated in a manner making it generally available to investors through such media as Dow Jones, Reuters Economic Services, The Wall Street Journal, Associated Press, or United Press International. The circulation of rumors, even if accurate, does not constitute information that is adequately available to the general public since the public does not know whether the rumor is accurate. 
 
 In addition, even after the Company s has publicly announced material information, a reasonable period of time must elapse in order for the market to react to the information. Employees may not trade on publicly announced material information until two full trading days after an announcement. For example, if an announcement is made before the commencement of trading on a Monday, an employee may trade in the Company s securities starting on Wednesday of that week, because two full trading days would have elapsed by then (all of Monday and Tuesday). If an announcement is made after trading begins on a Monday, employees may not trade in the Company s securities until Thursday. If the announcement is made on Friday after trading begins, employees may not trade in the Company s securities until Wednesday of the following week. 
 
 D. Who is a Related Person 
 For purposes of this Policy, a Related Person includes the spouse, minor children or anyone else living in an insider s household partnerships in which an insider is a general partner trusts of which an insider is a trustee estates of which an insider is an executor and any other legal entities controlled by an insider. Although a person s parent or sibling may not be considered a Related Person (unless living in the same household), a parent, sibling or other relative may be a tippee for securities laws purposes. Tipping material, nonpublic information to others also is prohibited, and is discussed in Section 4.D. 
 
 Section 4 Guidelines 
 A. Non-disclosure of Material Nonpublic Information 
 Material, nonpublic information must not be disclosed to anyone, except persons within the Company or third-party agents of the Company (e.g. investment banking advisors, auditors or outside legal counsel) whose positions require them to know it, until such information has been publicly released by the Company. 
 
 B. Prohibited Trading in Company Securities 
 No person may trade in the Company s securities, including by placing a purchase or sell order, making a gift or charitable donation, recommending that another person trade, or making or changing elections or otherwise reallocating funds relating to Company securities in retirement plan accounts, when he or she has knowledge of material, nonpublic information concerning the Company. Loans, pledges, gifts, charitable donations and other contributions of the Company s securities are also subject to this policy. 
 
 Directors, officers and colleagues are responsible for any trades placed by Related Persons and should make them aware of the need to confer with such person before they trade in the Company s securities. Directors, officers and colleagues should treat any such trades as if the transactions were for their own accounts. 
 
 C. Twenty-Twenty Hindsight 
 If securities transactions ever become the subject of scrutiny, they will be evaluated by enforcement authorities or others after-the-fact with the benefit of hindsight. As a result, before engaging in any 
 2 

Energizer Holdings, Inc. 
 Securities Trading Policy 
 Transactions in Company Securities Effective Date May 1, 2023 
 Supersedes August 1, 2022 

transaction an insider should carefully consider how the transaction, and whether the information was material, may be construed in the bright light of hindsight. 
 
 D. Tipping Information to Others 
 Insiders may be liable for communicating or tipping material, nonpublic information to any third party (a tippee ), regardless of whether the tippee is a Related Person. Further, insider trading violations are not limited to trading or tipping by insiders. Persons other than insiders also can be liable for insider trading, including tippees who trade on material, nonpublic information tipped to them and individuals who trade on material, nonpublic information which has been misappropriated. 
 
 Tippees inherit an insider s duties and are liable for trading on material, nonpublic information illegally tipped to them by an insider. Similarly, just as insiders are liable for the insider trading of their tippees, so are tippees who pass the information along to others who trade. In other words, a tippee s liability for insider trading is no different from that of an insider. Tippees can obtain material, nonpublic information by receiving explicit tips from others or from unintentional disclosure through, among other things, conversations at social, business or other gatherings. 
 
 E. Prohibition on Speculation and Hedging 
 Investing in the Company s securities provides an opportunity to share in the long-term growth of the Company. In contrast, short-term speculation based on fluctuations in the market for the Company s securities may be distracting, and may unduly focus the Company s directors, officers and colleagues on the Company s short-term stock market performance. Furthermore, such activities may put the potential for personal gain in conflict with the best interests of the Company and its shareholders or create the appearance of improper or inappropriate conduct involving the Company s securities. As such, directors, officers, colleagues and their Related Persons may not engage in any hedging or monetization transactions with respect to the Company s securities, including by trading in put or call options, warrants, swaps, forwards and other derivatives or similar instruments on the Company s securities, or by selling the Company s securities short. Additionally, directors, officers, colleagues and their Related Persons may not purchase financial instruments (including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds) that are designed to profit from, hedge or offset any change in the market value of equity securities (1) granted to the director, officer or colleague by the Company as part of the compensation of the colleague or director or (2) held, directly or indirectly, by the director, officer or colleague. 
 
 F. Prohibition on Pledging 
 Securities held in a margin account as collateral for a margin loan may be sold by the broker without the customer s consent if the customer fails to meet a margin call. Similarly, securities pledged (or hypothecated) as collateral for a loan may be sold in foreclosure if the borrower defaults on a loan. Because a margin sale or foreclosure sale may occur at a time when a person is aware of material, nonpublic information or otherwise not permitted to trade in the Company s securities, the Company s directors, officers, colleagues and their Related Persons are prohibited from holding the Company s securities in a margin account or otherwise pledging the Company s securities in any way including as collateral for a loan. 
 
 G. Trading in Other Securities 
 No director, officer, colleague or their Related Persons may trade in the securities of another company, including by placing purchase or sell order, making a gift or charitable donation, or recommending that another person trade, if the person learns of material, nonpublic information about the other company in the course of his her employment with the Company. 
 
 H. Standing Orders 
 Standing orders should be valid only for the remaining number of days in the pre-clearance period. A standing order placed with a broker to sell or purchase stock at a specified price leaves you with no control over the timing of the transaction. A standing order transaction executed by the broker when you are aware of material nonpublic information may result in unlawful insider trading. A standing order incorporated into a Rule 10b5-1 plan (a 10b5-1 Plan approved by the Company is permitted.

Energizer Holdings, Inc. 
 Securities Trading Policy 
 Transactions in Company Securities Effective Date May 1, 2023 
 Supersedes August 1, 2022 

I. Post-Termination Transactions 
 The policy continues to apply to transactions in Company securities even after termination of service to the Company. If you are in possession of material, nonpublic information when your employment or service to the Company terminates, you may not trade in Company securities until that information has become public or is no longer material. 
 
 J. Exception for Vesting and Related Tax Withholding 
 This policy does not apply to the vesting of restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units, or similar equity awards, or the Company s related withholding of shares of stock to satisfy tax withholding requirements upon the vesting of such restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units, or similar equity awards. For purposes of clarity, any securities acquired pursuant to such vesting may not be sold when the director, officer, or colleague of the Company is in possession of material, non-public information or subject to a special blackout period or, with respect to Energizer Insiders, when the Company s trading window is closed. 
 
 Section 5 Additional Restrictions and Requirements for Energizer Insiders 
 In addition to being subject to all of the other requirements within this policy, directors, executive officers and certain colleagues notified by the Company s Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel or Corporate Secretary as having routine access to material, confidential information about the Company (collectively, Energizer Insiders are required to comply with the following 
 
 A. Trading Windows and Closed Window Periods 
 
 (i) Closed Window Periods . Energizer Insiders are prohibited from trading in the Company s securities during the period beginning on the sixth business day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continuing until the second business day following the issuance of the Company s press release of its financial results for the reporting period that includes such calendar quarter (each of these periods called a closed window period ). By way of example, if the Company releases its financial results for the second calendar quarter of a given year on Tuesday, April 27 and the following Wednesday and Thursday are business days, then Energizer Insiders could trade in the Company s securities beginning on April 29 of such year until June 7 of such year. These periods are referred to as open window periods. 
 
 (ii) Special Blackout Periods . From time to time, other types of material information regarding the Company (such as negotiation or mergers, acquisitions or dispositions or other developments) may not be publicly disclosed. While such material information remains nonpublic, Energizer Insiders and other colleagues and persons with knowledge of such material, nonpublic information are prohibited from trading in the Company s securities. The affected persons must keep the existence of any special blackout period confidential. 
 
 (iii) Exception for Approved 10b5-1 Plans . The trading restrictions in this policy do not apply to transactions under a written plan, contract, instruction or arrangement under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that has been reviewed and approved in advance by the Company s Legal Department during an open trading window, and adopted by the Energizer Insider prior to the first day of the last month of the then-current quarter. Any amendment or modification to an existing Rule 10b5-1 Plan must also be reviewed and approved in advance by the Company s Legal Department during an open trading window, and adopted by the Energizer Insider prior to the first day of the last month of the then-current quarter. For example, if an Energizer Insider desires to adopt or modify a Rule 10b5-1 Plan during the first fiscal quarter, he she may do so during the period beginning on the date the window period opens and ending on November 30. 
 
 A 10b5-1 Plan must be in writing and must meet the requirements of the rules of the SEC, as they may exist from time to time, for establishing that a transaction in a company s securities 
 4 

Energizer Holdings, Inc. 
 Securities Trading Policy 
 Transactions in Company Securities Effective Date May 1, 2023 
 Supersedes August 1, 2022 

was not made on the basis of material, nonpublic information (currently contained in Rule 10b5-1), including but not limited to 
 
 The 10b5-1 Plan must include a cooling-off period before trading can commence. For 10b5-1 Plans relating to transactions in Energizer s securities, the cooling-off period shall begin on the day that the Rule 10b5-1 is adopted or modified and shall end 
 o For directors or Section 16 officers, on the first day of the last month of the next quarter, and 
 o For persons other than directors or Section 16 officers, on the day that is 30 days following the adoption or modification of the Rule 10b5-1 Plan. 
 For example, if a Section 16 officer adopts an approved Rule 10b5-1 Plan on November 20, the cooling-off period will end on March 1. 
 
 A person may not enter into overlapping Rule 10b5-1 Plans (subject to certain exceptions) and may only enter into one single-trade Rule 10b5-1 Plan during any 12-month period (subject to certain exceptions). 
 
 All persons entering into a Rule 10b5-1 Plan much include a representation in their Rule 10b5-1 Plan certifying that (i) they are not aware of any material non-public information, and (ii) they are adopting the plan in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions in Rule 10b5-1. 
 
 All persons entering into a Rule 10b5-1 Plan must act in good faith with respect to that plan. 
 
 Rule 10b5-1 Plans may only be terminated during an open trading window and at a time when the Energizer Insider is not in possession or aware of material non-public information. If an Energizer Insider terminates a Rule 10b5-1 Plan, he she must (i) promptly notify the Company s Legal Department, and (ii) wait at least nine (9) months before entering into a new Rule 10b5-1 Plan. For purposes of clarity, an Energizer Insider is not required to notify the Company s Legal Department if his her Rule 10b5-1 Plan expires in accordance with the Plan s terms. 
 
 If an Energizer Insider has adopted a Rule 10b5-1 Plan, he she may not enter into any transactions involving the Company s securities while that Plan is in effect, except as specifically approved in advance by the Company s General Counsel. 
 
 Trading windows are not safe harbors that ensure compliance with securities laws. Even during these open window periods, you are prohibited from trading if you are aware of material, nonpublic information about the Company . 
 
 B. Pre-Clearance 
 In addition to the prohibition on trading in a closed window period, Energizer Insiders are required to pre- clear all trades by the Energizer Insider, his her Related Person(s) or his her designee in the Company s securities with the Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel or Corporate Secretary, even if not in possession or aware of specific material non-public information. Prior clearance is required for all purchases or sales. Clearance will be granted or denied based solely on the restraints imposed by law and will not constitute investment advice regarding the advisability of any transaction or ensure compliance with securities laws. Clearance of a transaction is valid only for a maximum of five days, and may be reduced based on the circumstances, including if a closed window period is approaching. If the transaction order is not placed and executed within the pre-clearance period, a second trade clearance request must be made. If clearance is denied, the fact of such denial must be kept confidential by the person requesting such clearance.
