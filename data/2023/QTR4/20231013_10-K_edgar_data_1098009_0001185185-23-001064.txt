America Great Health, formerly Crown Marketing, is a Wyoming corporation (the "Company"). A change of control of the Company was completed on January 19, 2017 from Jay Hooper, the former officer and director of the Company and its former majority shareholder. Control was obtained by the sale of 16,155,746,000 shares of Company common stock from Mr. Hooper to an investor group led by Mike Q. Wang. In connection with the change of control, the Company sold to its former majority shareholder a subsidiary for 100 and another subsidiary in exchange for the cancellation of all payables and accrued expenses.

Our shares are subject to Section 15(g) and Rule 15g-9 of the Securities and Exchange Act, commonly referred to as the penny stock rule. The rule defines penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. The rule provides that any equity security is considered to be a penny stock unless that security is: 

- 

registered and traded on a national securities exchange meeting specified criteria set by the SEC; 

- 

issued by a registered investment company; 

- 

excluded from the definition on the basis of price (at least 5.00 per share) or the issuer s net tangible assets. 

Trading in the penny stocks is subject to additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Accredited investors, in general, include certain institutional investors and individuals with assets in excess of 1,000,000 or annual income exceeding 200,000 or 300,000 together with their spouse. 

For transactions covered by these rules, broker-dealers must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of our securities and must have received the purchaser s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving a penny stock, the rules require the delivery, prior to the first transaction, of a risk disclosure document relating to the penny stock. A broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, and current quotations for the security. Finally, monthly statements must be sent to the purchaser disclosing recent price information for the penny stocks. Consequently, these rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to trade or maintain a market in our common stock and may affect the ability of shareholders to sell their shares. 

Holders 

As of June 30, 2023, there were approximately 917 shareholders of record holding 21,107,018,148 shares of common stock. The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Holders of the common stock have no preemptive rights and no right to convert their common stock into any other securities. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures.

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements CFS were prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying CFS, the Company has incurred recurring net losses. For the year ended June 30, 2023 the Company recorded a net loss of 777,341, used cash to fund operating activities of 752,902 and at June 30, 2023, had a shareholders deficit of 4,525,835. For the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded a net loss of 4,924,936, used cash to fund operating activities of 1,479,859, and on June 30, 2022, had a shareholders deficit of 3,860,481. These factors create substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

The Company is raising the additional capital to achieve profitable operations. 

Our cash needs for the year ended June 30, 2023 were primarily met by loans and advances from our current majority shareholder. As of June 30, 2023, we had a cash balance of 54,150. Our future majority shareholders will need to provide all of our working capitals going forward. 

Primarily as a result of our recurring losses and our lack of liquidity, we received a report from our independent registered public accounting firm for our financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2023 that includes an explanatory paragraph describing the uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Financial Position 

As of June 30, 2023, we had 54,150 in cash, a working capital deficit of 2,912,469 and an accumulated deficit of 9,183,110. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Estimates 

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements CFS in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements. The more significant estimates and assumptions by management include among others, the fair value of shares of common stock issued for services. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions. 

Revenues 

Revenue from sale of goods under Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, is recognized in a manner that reasonably reflects the delivery of the Company s products and services to customers in return for expected consideration and includes the following elements: 

executed contract(s) with customers that the Company believes is legally enforceable; 

identification of performance obligation in the respective contract; 

determination of the transaction price for each performance obligation in the respective contract; 

allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation; and 

recognition of revenue only when the Company satisfies each performance obligation. 

Inventories 

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value. Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value are made, if required, for estimated excess, obsolescence, or impaired balances.

Table of Contents 

Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value measurements are determined using authoritative guidance issued by the FASB, with the exception of the application of the guidance to non-recurring, non-financial assets and liabilities as permitted. Fair value is defined in the authoritative guidance as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy was established, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into three broad levels as follows: 

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, are observable either directly or indirectly. 

Level 3 Unobservable inputs based on the Company s assumptions. 

The Company is required to use observable market data if available without undue cost and effort. 

The Company s financial instruments include cash and accounts payable. Management has estimated that the carrying amounts approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature. 

Loss Per Share 

Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares available. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. The Company s diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, as there are no potential shares outstanding that would have a dilutive effect. 

Income Taxes 

Income tax expense is based on pretax financial accounting income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. The Company recorded a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets as of June 30, 2023 and 2022. 

The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement. The Company classifies the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that the Company anticipates payment (or receipt) of cash within one year. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the provision for income taxes.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Based upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures performed by our Chief Executive Officer as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures have not been effective as a result of a weakness in the design of internal control over financial reporting identified below. 

As used herein, disclosure controls and procedures mean controls and other procedures of our company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting ICFR ), as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Accounting Officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our ICFR based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO 2013 ). Based on management s evaluation under the framework, management has concluded that our ICFR was not effective as of June 30, 2023. 

We identified material weaknesses in our ICFR primarily attributable to (i) lack of segregation of incompatible duties; and (ii) insufficient Board of Directors representation. These weaknesses are due to our inadequate staffing during the period covered by this report and our lack of working capital to hire additional staff. Management has retained an outside, independent financial consultant to record and review all financial data, as well as prepare our financial reports, in order to mitigate this weakness. Although management will periodically re-evaluate this situation, at this point it considers that the risk associated with such lack of segregation of duties and the potential benefits of adding employees to segregate such duties are not cost justified. We intend to hire additional accounting personnel to assist with financial reporting as soon as our finances will allow. 

This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding ICFR. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report.

Director Qualifications 

Directors are responsible for overseeing the Company s business consistent with their fiduciary duty to the shareholders. This significant responsibility requires highly skilled individuals with various qualities, attributes and professional experience. Our BOD believes that there are general requirements for service on the BOD that are applicable to directors and that there are other skills and experience that should be represented on the BOD as a whole but not necessarily by each director. The BOD considers the qualifications of director and director candidates individually and in the broader context of the BOD s overall composition and the Company s current and future needs. 

Qualifications, Attributes, Skills and Experience to be Represented on the Board as a Whole 

The BOD has identified particular qualifications, attributes, skills and experience that are important to be represented on the board as a whole, in light of the Company s current needs and its business priorities. The BOD believes that it should include some directors with a high level of financial literacy and some directors who possess relevant business experience as a Chief Executive Officer or a President or like position. Marketing is the core focus of our business, and the Company seeks to develop and deploy the world s most innovative and effective marketing and technology. Therefore, the Board believes that marketing and technology experience should be represented on the BOD. Since the Company is involved in the healthcare business, the Company s business also requires compliance with a variety of regulatory requirements and relationships with various governmental entities. Therefore, the BOD believes that governmental, political, or diplomatic expertise should be represented on the Board. 

Set forth below are a chart and a narrative disclosure that summarize the specific qualifications, attributes, skills and experiences described above. An X in the chart below indicates that the item is a specific reason that the director has been nominated to serve on the Company s Board. The lack of an X for a particular qualification does not mean that the director does not possess that qualification or skill. Rather, an X indicates a specific area of focus or expertise of a director on which the BOD currently relies.

Material Changes to the Procedures by which Security Holders May Recommend Nominees to the Board of Directors 

There have been no material changes to the procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to the BOD. 

Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight 

Mr. Mike Q. Wang is our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer. As a main officer and director, Mr. Wang, by default, serves as our business and industry leader most capable of identifying strategic priorities and executing our business strategy. In addition, having a single leader eliminates the potential for confusion and provides clear leadership for the Company. We believe that this leadership structure has served the Company well. The Board s role in the risk oversight of the Company includes, among other things: 

appointing, retaining and overseeing the work of the independent auditors, including resolving disagreements between the management and the independent auditors relating to financial reporting; 

approving all auditing and non-auditing services permitted to be performed by the independent auditors; 

reviewing annually the independence and quality control procedures of the independent auditors; 

reviewing and approving all proposed related party transactions; 

discussing the annual audited financial statements with the management; and 

meeting separately with the independent auditors to discuss critical accounting policies, management letters, recommendations on internal controls, the auditor s engagement letter and independence letter and other material written communications between the independent auditors and the management. 

Our BOD is responsible for approving all related party transactions. We have not adopted written policies and procedures specifically for related person transactions.

During the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company's current majority shareholder advanced 224,423 to the Company as working capital and the Company repaid 373,140 to the shareholder.

Director Independence 

Currently, the Company does not have any independent directors. Since the Company s common stock is not currently listed on a national securities exchange, we have used the definition of independence of The NASDAQ Stock Market to make this determination. 

Under NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2), an "independent director" is a "person other than an officer or employee of the company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the company's board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director." 

We do not currently have a separately designated audit, nominating or compensation committee. However, we do intend to comply with the independent director and committee composition requirements in the future.

Pre-approval Policies 

We do not have a standing audit committee currently serving and as a result our BOD performs the duties of an audit committee. Our BOD evaluates and approves, in advance, the scope and cost of the engagement of an accounting firm before the accounting firm renders audit and non-audit services. We do not rely on pre-approval policies and procedures.

(the Company) as of June 30, 2023, and the related statement of operations, stockholders deficit and cash flows for the period then ended and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the period then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Going Concern Uncertainty 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred losses since inception of 9,183,110 and a net loss of 777,341. These factors create an uncertainty as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Emphasis of Matters-Risks and Uncertainties

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

Investment in Purecell Group Purecell 

As described in Note 1,8 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company issued 545,000,000 shares to acquire 51 of Purecell s equity interest. Management reviews its equity investment in Purecell and accounted for under the equity methods because the Company does not have significant control over Purecell. The Company hired an external valuation firm to perform 409A valuation as of the acquisition date to determine the fair value of the Company s common share. The share was valued at 0.00001 per share. 

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the fair value of the investment in Purecell is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures. 

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included(i) evaluating the appropriateness of comparable market value and (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of cost to recreate a similar company.

 (b) If such Capital Expenditure is not the result of the specific and unique use of the Premises by Lessee (such as, governmentally mandated seismic modifications), then Lessor shall pay for such capital Expenditure and Lessee shall only be obligated to pay, each month during the remainder of the term of this Lease or any extension thereof, on the date that on which the Base Rent is due, an amount equal to 1/144th of the portion of such costs reasonably attributable to the Premises. Lessee shall pay Interest on the balance but may prepay its obligation at any time. If, however, such Capital Expenditure is required during the last 2 years of this Lease or if Lessor reasonably determines that it is not economically feasible to pay its share thereof, Lessor shall have the option to terminate this Lease upon 90 days prior written notice to Lessee unless Lessee notifies Lessor, in writing, within 10 days after receipt of Lessor's termination notice that Lessee will pay for such Capital Expenditure. If Lessor does not elect to terminate, and fails to tender its share of any such Capital Expenditure, Lessee may advance such funds and deduct same, with Interest, from Rent until Lessor's share of such costs have been fully paid. If Lessee is unable to finance Lessor's share, or if the balance of the Rent due and payable for the remainder of this Lease is not sufficient to fully reimburse Lessee on an offset basis, Lessee shall have the right to terminate this Lease upon 30 days written notice to Lessor. 

 (c) Notwithstanding the above, the provisions concerning Capital Expenditures are intended to apply only to non-voluntary, unexpected, and new Applicable Requirements. If the Capital Expenditures are instead triggered by Lessee as a result of an actual or proposed change in use, change in intensity of use, or modification to the Premises then, and in that event, Lessee shall either: (i) immediately cease such changed use or intensity of use and/or take such other steps as may be necessary to eliminate the requirement for such Capital Expenditure, or (ii) complete such Capital Expenditure at its own expense. Lessee shall not have any right to terminate this Lease.

However, any such item that is not specifically attributable to the Building or to any other building or to the operation, repair and maintenance thereof, shall be equitably allocated by Lessor to all buildings in the Project. 

 (e) The inclusion of the improvements, facilities and services set forth in Subparagraph 4.2(c) shall not be deemed to impose an obligation upon Lessor to either have said improvements or facilities or to provide those services unless the Project already has the same, Lessor already provides the services, or Lessor has agreed elsewhere in this Lease to provide the same or some of them. 

 (f) Lessee's Share of Operating Expense Increase is payable monthly on the same day as the Base Rent is due hereunder. The amount of such payments shall be based on Lessor's estimate of the Operating Expense Expenses. Within 60 days after written request (but not more than once each year) Lessor shall deliver to Lessee a reasonably detailed statement showing Lessee's Share of the actual Common Area Operating Expenses for the preceding year. If Lessee's payments during such Year exceed Lessee's Share, Lessee shall credit the amount of such over-payment against Lessee's future payments. If Lessee's payments during such Year were less than Lessee's Share, Lessee shall pay to Lessor the amount of the deficiency within 10 days after delivery by Lessor to Lessee of said statement. Lessor and Lessee shall forthwith adjust between them by cash payment any balance determined to exist with respect to that portion of the last Comparison Year for which Lessee is responsible as to Operating Expense Increases, notwithstanding that the Lease term may have terminated before the end of such Comparison Year.

All monetary amounts shall be rounded to the nearest whole dollar. Inthe event that any invoice prepared by Lessor is inaccurate such inaccuracy shall not constitute a waiver and Lessee shall be obligated to pay the amount set forth in this Lease. Rent for any period during the term hereof which is for less than one full calendar month shall be prorated based upon the actual number of days of said month. Payment of Rent shall be made to Lessor at its address stated herein or to such other persons or place as Lessor may from time to time designate in writing. Acceptance of a payment which is less than the amount then due shall not be a waiver of Lessor's rights to the balance of such Rent, regardless of Lessor's endorsement of any check so stating. In the event that any check, draft, or other instrument of payment given by Lessee to Lessor is dishonored for any reason, Lessee agrees to pay to Lessor the sum of 25 in addition to any Late Charge and Lessor, at its option, may require all future Rent be paid by cashier's check. Payments will be applied first to accrued late charges and attorney's fees, second to accrued interest, then to Base Rent and Common Area Operating Expenses, and any remaining amount to any other outstanding charges or costs. 

5. Security Deposit. Lessee shall deposit with Lessor upon execution hereof the Security Deposit as security for Lessee's faithful performance of its obligations under this Lease. If Lessee fails to pay Rent, or otherwise Defaults under this Lease, Lessor may use, apply or retain all or any portion of said Security Deposit for the payment of any amount already due Lessor, for Rents which will be due in the future, and/ or to reimburse or compensate Lessor for any liability, expense, loss or damage which Lessor may suffer or incur by reason thereof. If Lessor uses or applies all or any portion of the Security Deposit, Lessee shall within 10 days after written request therefor deposit monies with Lessor sufficient to restore said Security Deposit to the full amount required by this Lease. If the Base Rent increases 

4 of 18

during the term of this Lease, Lessee shall, upon written request from Lessor, deposit additional monies with Lessor so that the total amount of the Security Deposit shall at all times bear the same proportion to the increased Base Rent as the initial Security Deposit bore to the initial Base Rent. Should the Agreed Use be amended to accommodate a material change in the business of Lessee or to accommodate a sublessee or assignee, Lessor shall have the right to increase the Security Deposit to the extent necessary, in Lessor's reasonable judgment, to account for any increased wear and tear that the Premises may suffer as a result thereof. If a change in control of Lessee occurs during this Lease and following such change the financial condition of Lessee is, in Lessor's reasonable judgment, significantly reduced, Lessee shall deposit such additional monies with Lessor as shall be sufficient to cause the Security Deposit to be at a commercially reasonable level based on such change in financial condition. Lessor shall not be required to keep the Security Deposit separate from its general accounts. Within 90 days after the expiration or termination of this Lease, Lessor shall return that portion of the Security Deposit not used or applied by Lessor. Lessor shall upon written request provide Lessee with an accounting showing how that portion of the Security Deposit that was not returned was applied. No part of the Security Deposit shall be considered to be held in trust, to bear interest or to be prepayment for any monies to be paid by Lessee under this Lease.

Other than guide, signal and seeing eye dogs, Lessee shall not keep or allow in the Premises any pets, animals, birds, fish, or reptiles. Lessor shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to any written request for a modification of the Agreed Use, so long as the same will not impair the structural integrity of the improvements of the Building, will not adversely affect the mechanical, electrical, HVAC, and other systems of the Building, and/or will not affect the exterior appearance of the Building.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessee may use any ordinary and customary materials reasonably required to be used in the normal course of the Agreed Use such as ordinary office supplies (copier toner, liquid paper, glue, etc.) and common household cleaning materials, so long as such use is in compliance with all Applicable Requirements, is not a Reportable Use, and does not expose the Premises or neighboring property to any meaningful risk of contamination or damage or expose Lessor to any liability therefor. In addition, Lessor may condition its consent to any Reportable Use upon receiving such additional assurances as Lessor reasonably deems necessary to protect itself, the public, the Premises and/or the environment against damage, contamination, injury and/or liability, including, but not limited to, the installation (and removal on or before Lease expiration or termination) of protective modifications (such as concrete encasements) and/or increasing the Security Deposit.

Lessee shall cooperate fully in any such activities at the request of Lessor, including allowing Lessor and Lessor's agents to have reasonable access to the Premises at reasonable times in order to carry out Lessor's investigative and remedial responsibilities. 

 (g) Lessor Termination Option. If a Hazardous Substance Condition (see Paragraph 9.l(e)) occurs during the term of this Lease, unless Lessee is legally responsible therefor (in which case Lessee shall make the investigation and remediation thereof required by the Applicable Requirements and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect, but subject to Lessor's rights under Paragraph 6.2(d) and Paragraph 13), Lessor may, at Lessor's option, either (i) investigate and remediate such Hazardous Substance Condition, if required, as soon as reasonably possible at Lessor's expense, in which event this Lease shall continue in full force and effect, or (ii) if the estimated cost to remediate such condition exceeds 12 times the then monthly Base Rent or 100,000, whichever is greater, give written notice to Lessee, within 

5 of 18

30 days after receipt by Lessor of knowledge of the occurrence of such Hazardous Substance Condition, of Lessor's desire to terminate this Lease as of the date 60 days following the date of such notice. In the event Lessor elects to give a termination notice, Lessee may, within 10 days thereafter, give written notice to Lessor of Lessee's commitment to pay the amount by which the cost of the remediation of such Hazardous Substance Condition exceeds an amount equal to 12 times the then monthly Base Rent or 100,000, whichever is greater. Lessee shall provide Lessor with said funds or satisfactory assurance thereof within 30 days following such commitment. In such event, this Lease shall continue in full force and effect, and Lessor shall proceed to make such remediation as soon as reasonably possible after the required funds are available.

Except as otherwise provided in this Lease, Lessee shall, at Lessee's sole expense, fully, diligently and in a timely manner, materially comply with all Applicable Requirements, the requirements of any applicable fire insurance underwriter or rating bureau, and the recommendations of Lessor's engineers and/or consultants which relate in any manner to the Premises, without regard to whether sa'1d Applicable Requirements are now in effect or become effective after the Start Date. Lessee shall, within 10 days after receipt of Lessor's written request, provide Lessor with copies of all permits and other documents, and other information evidencing Lessee's compliance with any Applicable Requirements specified by Lessor, and shall immediately upon receipt, notify Lessor in writing (with copies of any documents involved) of any threatened or actual claim, notice, citation, warning, complaint or report pertaining to or involving the failure of Lessee or the Premises to comply with any Applicable Requirements. Likewise, Lessee shall immediately give written notice to Lessor of: (i) any water damage to the Premises and any suspected seepage, pooling, dampness or other condition conducive to the production of mold; or (ii) any mustiness or other odors that might indicate the presence of mold in the Premises. 

 6.4 Inspection; Compliance. Lessor and Lessor's Lender (as defined in Paragraph 30) and consultants authorized by Lessor shall have the right to enter into Premises at any time, in the case of an emergency, and otherwise at reasonable times, after reasonable notice, for the purpose of inspecting and/or testing the condition of the Premises and/or for verifying compliance by Lessee with this Lease.

In such case, Lessee shall upon request reimburse Lessor for the cost of such inspection, so long as such inspection is reasonably related to the violation or contamination. In addition, Lessee shall provide copies of all relevant material safety data sheets (MSDS) to Lessor within 10 days of the receipt of written request therefor. Lessee acknowledges that any failure on its part to allow such inspections or testing will expose Lessor to risks and potentially cause Lessor to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the extent of which will be extremely difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, should the Lessee fail to allow such inspections and/or testing in a timely fashion the Base Rent shall be automatically increased, without any requirement for notice to Lessee, by an amount equal to 10 of the then existing Base Rent or 100, whichever is greater for the remainder to the Lease. The Parties agree that such increase in Base Rent represents fair and reasonable compensation for the additional risk/costs that Lessor will incur by reason of Lessee's failure to allow such inspection and/or testing. Such increase in Base Rent shall in no event constitute a waiver of Lessee's Default or Breach with respect to such failure nor prevent the exercise of any of the other rights and remedies granted hereunder.

In addition, Lessee rather than the Lessor shall be responsible for the cost of painting, repairing or replacing wall coverings, and to repair or replace any similar improvements within the Premises. Lessor may, at its option, upon reasonable notice, elect to have Lessee perform any particular such maintenance or repairs the cost of which is otherwise Lessee's responsibility hereunder. 

 7.2 Lessor's Obligation s. Subject to the provisions of Paragraphs 2.2 (Condition), 2.3 (Compliance). 4.2 (Operating Expenses). 6 (Use), 7.1 (Lessee's Obligations), 9 (Damage or Destruction) and 14 (Condemnation), Lessor, subject to reimbursement pursuant to Paragraph 4.2, shall keep in good order, condition and repair the foundations, exterior walls, structural condition of interior bearing walls, exterior roof, fire sprinkler system, fire alarm and/or smoke detection systems, fire hydrants, and the Common Areas. 

 7.3 Utility Installations; Trade Fixtures; Alterations. 

 (a) Definitions. The term Utility Installations refers to all floor and window coverings, air lines, vacuum lines, power panels, electrical distribution, security and fire protection systems, communication cabling, lighting fixtures, HVAC equipment, and plumbing in or on the Premises. The term Trade Fixtures shall mean Lessee's machinery and equipment that can be removed without doing material damage to the Premises. The term Alterations shall mean any modification of the improvements, other than Utility Installations or Trade Fixtures, whether by addition or deletion. Lessee Owned Alterations and/or Utility Installations are defined as Alterations and/or Utility Installations made by Lessee that are not yet owned by Lessor pursuant to Paragraph 7.4(a). 

 (b) Consent. Lessee shall not make any Alterations or Utility Installations to the Premises without Lessor's prior written consent. Lessee may, however, make non-structural Alterations or Utility Installations to the interior of the Premises (excluding the roof) without such consent but upon notice to Lessor, as long as they are not visible from the outside, do not involve puncturing, relocating or removing the roof, ceilings, floors or any existing walls, will not affect the electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and/or life safety systems, do not trigger the requirement for additional modifications and/or improvements to the Premises resulting from Applicable Requirements, such as compliance with Title 24, and the cumulative cost thereof during this Lease as extended does not exceed 2000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessee shall not make or permit any roof penetrations and/or install anvthing on the roof without the prior written approval of Lessor. Lessor may, as a precondition to granting such approval, require Lessee to utilize a contractor chosen and/or approved by Lessor. Any Alterations or Utility Installations that Lessee shall desire to make and which require the consent of the Lessor shall be presented to Lessor in written form with detailed plans. Consent shall be deemed conditioned upon Lessee's: (i) acquiring all applicable governmental permits, (ii) furnishing Lessor with copies of both the permits and the plans and specifications prior to commencement of the work, and (iii) compliance with all conditions of said permits and other Applicable Requirements in a prompt and expeditious manner. Any Alterations or Utility Installations shall be performed in a workmanlike manner with good and sufficient materials. Lessee shall promptly upon completion furnish Lessor with as-built plans and specifications. For work which costs an amount in excess of one month's Base Rent, Lessor may condition its consent upon Lessee providing a lien and completion bond in an amount equal to 150 of the estimated cost of such Alteration or Utility Installation and/or upon Lessee's posting an additional Security Deposit with Lessor. 

 (c) Liens; Bonds. Lessee shall pay, when due, all claims for labor or materials furnished or alleged to have been furnished to or for Lessee at or for use on the Premises, which claims are or may be secured by any mechanic's or materialmen's lien against the Premises or any interest therein. Lessee shall give Lessor not less than 10 days notice prior to the commencement of any work in, on or about the Premises, and Lessor shall have the right to post notices of non-responsibility. If Lessee shall contest the validity of any such lien, claim or demand, then Lessee shall, at its sole expense defend and protect itself, Lessor and the Premises against the same and shall pay and satisfy any such adverse judgment that may be rendered thereon before the enforcement thereof. If Lessor shall require, Lessee shall furnish a surety bond in an amount equal to 150 of the amount of such contested lien, claim or demand, indemnifying Lessor against liability for the same. If Lessor elects to participate in any such action, Lessee shall pay Lessor's attorneys' fees and costs. 

7.4 

Ownership; Removal; Surrender; and Restoration. 

6 of 18

(a) Ownership. Subject to Lessor's right to require removal or elect ownership as hereinafter provided, all Alterations and Utility Installations made by Lessee shall be the property of Lessee, but considered a part of the Premises. Lessor may, at any time, elect in writing to be the owner of all or any specified part of the Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations. Unless otherwise instructed per paragraph 7.4(b) hereof, all Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations shall, at the expiration or termination of this Lease, become the property of Lessor and be surrendered by Lessee with the Premises. 

 (b) Removal . By delivery to Lessee of written notice from Lessor not earlier than 90 and not later than 30 days prior to the end of the term of this Lease, Lessor may require that any or all Lessee Owned Alterations or Utility Installations be removed by the expiration or termination of this Lease. Lessor may require the removal at any time of all or any part of any Lessee Owned Alterations or Utility Installations made without the required consent. 

 (c) Surrender; Restoration. Lessee shall surrender the Premises by the Expiration Date or any earlier termination date, with all of the improvements, parts and surfaces thereof clean and free of debris, and in good operating order, condition and state of repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted. Ordinary wear and tear shall not include any damage or deterioration that would have been prevented by good maintenance practice. Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of Paragraph 7.l(a), if the Lessee occupies the Premises for 12 months or less, then Lessee shall surrender the Premises in the same condition as delivered to Lessee on the Start Date with NO allowance for ordinary wear and tear. Lessee shall repair any damage occasioned by the installation, maintenance or removal of Trade Fixtures, Lessee owned Alterations and/or Utility Installations, furnishings, and equipment as well as the removal of any storage tank installed by or for Lessee. Lessee shall also remove from the Premises any and all Hazardous Substances brought onto the Premises by or for Lessee, or any third party (except Hazardous Substances which were deposited via underground migration from areas outside of the Premises) to the level specified in Applicable Requirements. Trade Fixtures shall remain the property of Lessee and shall be removed by Lessee. Any personal property of Lessee not removed on or before the Expiration Date or any earlier termination date shall be deemed to have been abandoned by Lessee and may be disposed of or retained by Lessor as Lessor may desire. The failure by Lessee to timely vacate the Premises pursuant to this Paragraph 7.4(c) without the express written consent of Lessor shall constitute a holdover under the provisions of Paragraph 26 below. 

8. Insurance; Indemnity. 

 8.1 Insurance Premiums. The cost of the premiums for the insurance policies maintained by Lessor pursuant to paragraph 8 are included as Operating Expenses (see paragraph 4.2 (c)(iv)). Said costs shall include increases in the premiums resulting from additional coverage related to requirements of the holder of a mortgage or deed of trust covering the Premises, Building and/or Project, increased valuation of the Premises, Building and/or Project, and/or a general premium rate increase. Said costs shall not, however, include any premium increases resulting from the nature of the occupancy of any other tenant of the Building. If the Project was not insured for the entirety of the Base Year, then the base premium shall be the lowest annual premium reasonably obtainable for the required insurance as of the Start Date, assuming the most nominal use possible of the Building and/or Project. In no event, however, shall Lessee be responsible for any portion of the premium cost attributable to liability insurance coverage in excess of 2,000,000 procured under Paragraph 8.2(b). 

 8.2 Liability Insurance. 

 (a) Carried by Lessee. Lessee shall obtain and keep in force a Commercial General Liability policy of insurance protecting Lessee and Lessor as an additional insured against claims for bodily injury, personal injury and property damage based upon or arising out of the ownership, use, occupancy or maintenance of the Premises and all areas appurtenant thereto. Such insurance shall be on an occurrence basis providing single limit coverage in an amount not less than 1,000,000 per occurrence with an annual aggregate of not less than 2,000,000. Lessee shall add Lessor as an additional insured by means of an endorsement at least as broad as the Insurance Service Organization's Additional Insured-Managers or Lessors of Premises Endorsement and coverage shall also be extended to include damage caused by heat, smoke or fumes from a hostile fire. The policy shall not contain any intra-insured exclusions as between insured persons or organizations, but shall include coverage for liability assumed under this Lease as an insured contract for the performance of Lessee's indemnity obligations under this Lease. The limits of said insurance shall not, however, limit the liability of Lessee nor relieve Lessee of any obligation hereunder. Lessee shall provide an endorsement on its liability policy(ies) which provides that its insurance shall be primary to and not contributory with any similar insurance carried by Lessor, whose insurance shall be considered excess insurance only. 

 (b) Carried by Lessor. Lessor shall maintain liability insurance as described in Paragraph 8.2(a), in addition to, and not in lieu of, the insurance required to be maintained by Lessee. Lessee shall not be named as an additional insured therein. 

 8.3 P roperty Insurance - Building, Improvements and Rental Value. 

 (a) Building and Improvements. Lessor shall obtain and keep in force a policy or policies of insurance in the name of Lessor, with loss payable to Lessor, any ground-lessor, and to any Lender insuring loss or damage to the Building and/or Project. The amount of such insurance shall be equal to the full insurable replacement cost of the Building and/or Project, as the same shall exist from time to time, or the amount required by any Lender, but in no event more than the commercially reasonable and available insurable value thereof. Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations, Trade Fixtures, and Lessee's personal property shall be insured by Lessee not by Lessor. If the coverage is available and commercially appropriate, such policy or policies shall insure against all risks of direct physical loss or damage (except the perils of flood and/or earthquake unless required by a Lender), including coverage for debris removal and the enforcement of any Applicable Requirements requiring the upgrading, demolition, reconstruction or replacement of any portion of the Premises as the result of a covered loss. Said policy or policies shall also contain an agreed valuation provision in lieu of any coinsurance clause, waiver of subrogation, and inflation guard protection causing an increase in the annual property insurance coverage amount by a factor of not less than the adjusted U.S. Department of Labor Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers for the 

 city nearest to where the Premises are located. If such insurance coverage has a deductible clause, the deductible amount shall not exceed 5,000 per occurrence. 

 (b) Rental Value. Lessor shall also obtain and keep in force a policy or policies in the name of Lessor with loss payable to Lessor and any Lender, insuring the loss of the full Rent for one year with an extended period of indemnity for an additional 180 days Rental Value insurance ). Said insurance shall contain an agreed valuation provision in lieu of any coinsurance clause, and the amount of coverage shall be adjusted annually to reflect the projected Rent otherwise payable by Lessee, for the next 12 month period. 

 (c) Adjacent Premises. Lessee shall pay for any increase in the premiums for the property insurance of the Building and for the Common Areas or other buildings in the Project if said increase is caused by Lessee's acts, omissions, use or occupancy of the Premises. 

 (d) Lessee's Improvements. Since Lessor is the Insuring Party, Lessor shall not be required to insure Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations unless the item in question has become the property of Lessor under the terms of this Lease. 

 8.4 L essee's Property; Business Interruption Insurance; Worker's Compensation Insurance. 

 (a) Property Damage. Lessee shall obtain and maintain insurance coverage on all of Lessee's personal property, Trade Fixtures, and Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations. Such insurance shall be full replacement cost coverage with a deductible of not to exceed 1,000 per occurrence. The proceeds from any such insurance shall be used by Lessee for the replacement of personal property, Trade Fixtures and Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations. 

 (b) Worker's Compensation Insurance. Lessee shall obtain and maintain Worker's Compensation Insurance in such amount as may be required by Applicable Requirements. Such policy shall include a 'Waiver of Subrogation' endorsement. Lessee shall provide Lessor with a copy of such endorsement along with the certificate of insurance or copy of the policy required by paragraph 8.5. 

 (c) Business Interruption. Lessee shall obtain and maintain loss of income and extra expense insurance in amounts as will reimburse Lessee for direct or ind 1rect loss of earnings attributable to all perils commonly insured against by prudent lessees in the business of Lessee or attributable to prevention of access to the 

7 of 18

Premises as a result of such perils. 

 (d) No Representation of Adequate Coverage. Lessor makes no representation that the limits or forms of coverage of insurance specified herein are adequate to cover Lessee's property, business operations or obligations under this Lease. 

 8.5 Insurance Policies. Insurance required herein shall be by companies maintaining during the policy term a General Policyholders Rating of at least A-, VII, as set forth in the most current issue of Best's Insurance Guide , or such other rating as may be required by a Lender. Lessee shall not do or permit to be done anything which invalidates the required insurance policies. Lessee shall, prior to the Start Date, deliver to Lessor certified copies of policies of such insurance or certificates with copies of the required endorsements evidencing the existence and amounts of the required insurance. No such policy shall be cancelable or subject to modification except after 10 days prior written notice to Lessor. Lessee shall, at least 30 days prior to the expiration of such policies, furnish Lessor with evidence of renewals or insurance binders evidencing renewal thereof, or Lessor may increase his liability insurance coverage and charge the cost thereof to Lessee, which amount shall be payable by Lessee to Lessor upon demand. Such policies shall be for a term of at least one year, or the length of the remaining term of this Lease, whichever is less. If either Party shall fail to procure and maintain the insurance required to be carried by it, the other Party may, but shall not be required to, procure and maintain the same. 

 8.6 Waiver of Subrogation. Without affecting any other rights or remedies, Lessee and Lessor each hereby release and relieve the other, and waive their entire right to recover damages against the other, for loss of or damage to its property arising out of or incident to the perils required to be insured against herein. The effect of such releases and waivers is not limited by the amount of insurance carried or required, or by any deductibles applicable hereto. The Parties agree to have their respective property damage insurance carriers waive any right to subrogation that such companies may have against Lessor or Lessee, as the case may be, so long as the insurance is not invalidated thereby. 

 8.7 Indemnity. Except for Lessor's gross negligence or willful misconduct, Lessee shall indemnify, protect, defend and hold harmless the Premises, Lessor and its agents, Lessor's master or ground lessor, partners and Lenders, from and against any and all claims, loss of rents and/or damages, liens, judgments, penalties, attorneys' and consultants' fees, expenses and/or liabilities arising out of, involving, or in connection with, a Breach of the Lease by Lessee and/or the use and/or occupancy of the Premises and/or Project by Lessee and/or by Lessee's employees, contractors or invitees. If any action or proceeding is brought against Lessor by reason of any of the foregoing matters, Lessee shall upon notice defend the same at Lessee's expense by counsel reasonably satisfactory to Lessor and Lessor shall cooperate with Lessee in such defense. Lessor need not have first paid any such claim in order to be defended or indemnified. 

 8.8 Exemption of Lessor and its Agents from Liability. Notwithstanding the negligence or breach of this Lease by Lessor or its agents, neither Lessor nor its agents shall be liable under any circumstances for: (i) injury or damage to the person or goods, wares, merchandise or other property of Lessee, Lessee's employees, contractors, invitees, customers, or any other person in or about the Premises, whether such damage or injury is caused by or results from fire, steam, electricity, gas, water or rain, indoor air quality, the presence of mold or from the breakage, leakage, obstruction or other defects of pipes, fire sprinklers, wires, appliances, plumbing, HVAC or lighting fixtures, or from any other cause, whether the said injury or damage results from conditions arising upon the Premises or upon other portions of the Building, or from other sources or places, (ii) any damages arising from any act or neglect of any other tenant of Lessor or from the failure of Lessor or its agents to enforce the provisions of any other lease in the Project, or (iii) injury to Lessee's business or for any loss of income or profit therefrom. Instead, it is intended that Lessee's sole recourse in the event of such damages or injury be to file a claim on the insurance policy(ies) that Lessee is required to maintain pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 8. 

 8.9 Failure to Provide Insurance. Lessee acknowledges that any failure on its part to obtain or maintain the insurance required herein will expose Lessor to risks and potentially cause Lessor to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the extent of which will be extremely difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, for any month or portion thereof that Lessee does not maintain the required insurance and/or does not provide Lessor with the required binders or certificates evidencing the existence of the required insurance, the Base Rent shall be automatically increased, without any requirement for notice to Lessee, by an amount equal to 10 of the then existing Base Rent or 100, whichever is greater. The parties agree that such increase in Base Rent represents fair and reasonable compensation for the additional risk/costs that Lessor will incur by reason of Lessee's failure to maintain the required insurance. Such increase in Base Rent shall in no event constitute a waiver of Lessee's Default or Breach with respect to the failure to maintain such insurance, prevent the exercise of any of the other rights and remedies granted hereunder, nor relieve Lessee of its obligation to maintain the insurance specified in this Lease. 

9. Damage or Destruction. 

 9.1 Definitions. 

 (a) Premises Partial Damage shall mean damage or destruction to the improvements on the Premises, other than Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations, which can reasonably be repaired in 3 months or less from the date of the damage or destruction, and the cost thereof does not exceed a sum equal to 6 month's Base Rent. Lessor shall notify Lessee in writing within 30 days from the date of the damage or destruction as to whether or not the damage is Partial or Total. 

 (b) Premises Total Destruction shall mean damage or destruction to the improvements on the Premises, other than Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations and Trade Fixtures, which cannot reasonably be repaired in 3 months or less from the date of the damage or destruction and/or the cost thereof exceeds a sum equal to 6 month's Base Rent. Lessor shall notify Lessee in writing within 30 days from the date of the damage or destruction as to whether or not the damage is Partial or Total. 

 (c) Insured Loss shall mean damage or destruction to improvements on the Premises, other than Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations and Trade Fixtures, which was caused by an event required to be covered by the insurance described in Paragraph S.3(a), irrespective of any deductible amounts or coverage limits involved. 

 (d) Replacement Cost shall mean the cost to repair or rebuild the improvements owned by Lessor at the time of the occurrence to their condition existing immediately prior thereto, including demolition, debris removal and upgrading required by the operation of Applicable Requirements, and without deduction for depreciation. 

 (e) Hazardous Substance Condition shall mean the occurrence or discovery of a condition involving the presence of, or a contamination by, a Hazardous Substance, in, on, or under the Premises which requires restoration. 

 9.2 Partial Damage - Insured Loss. If a Premises Partial Damage that is an Insured Loss occurs, then Lessor shall, at Lessor's expense, repair such damage (but not Lessee's Trade Fixtures or Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations) as soon as reasonably possible and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect; provided, however, that Lessee shall, at Lessor's election, make the repair of any damage or destruction the total cost to repair of which is 5,000 or less, and, in such event, Lessor shall make any applicable insurance proceeds available to Lessee on a reasonable basis for that purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the required insurance was not in force or the insurance proceeds are not sufficient to effect such repair, the Insuring Party shall promptly contribute the shortage in proceeds as and when required to complete said repairs. In the event, however, such shortage was due to the fact that, by reason of the unique nature of the improvements, full replacement cost insurance coverage was not commercially reasonable and available, Lessor shall have no obligation to pay for the shortage in insurance proceeds or to fully restore the unique aspects of the Premises unless Lessee provides Lessor with the funds to cover same, or adequate assurance thereof, within 10 days following receipt of written notice of such shortage and request therefor. If Lessor receives said funds or adequate assurance thereof within said 10 day period, the party responsible for making the repairs shall complete them as soon as reasonably possible and this Lease shall remain in full force and effect. If such funds or 

8 of 18

assurance are not received, Lessor may nevertheless elect by written notice to Lessee within 10 days thereafter to: (i) make such restoration and repair as is commercially reasonable with Lessor paying any shortage in proceeds, in which case this Lease shall remain in full force and effect, or (ii) have this Lease terminate 30 days thereafter. Lessee shall not be entitled to reimbursement of any funds contributed by Lessee to repair any such damage or destruction. Premises Partial Damage due to flood or earthquake shall be subject to Paragraph 9.3, notwithstanding that there may be some insurance coverage, but the net proceeds of any such insurance shall be made available for the repairs if made by either Party. 

 9.3 Partial Damage - Uninsured Loss. If a Premises Partial Damage that is not an Insured Loss occurs, unless caused by a negligent or willful act of Lessee (in which event Lessee shall make the repairs at Lessee's expense), Lessor may either: (i) repair such damage as soon as reasonably possible at Lessor's expense (subject to reimbursement pursuant to Paragraph 4.2), in which event this Lease shall continue in full force and effect, or (ii) terminate this Lease by giving written notice to Lessee within 30 days after receipt by Lessor of knowledge of the occurrence of such damage. Such termination shall be effective 60 days following the date of such notice. In the event Lessor elects to terminate this Lease, Lessee shall have the right within 10 days after receipt of the termination notice to give written notice to Lessor of Lessee's commitment to pay for the repair of such damage without reimbursement from Lessor. Lessee shall provide Lessor with said funds or satisfactory assurance thereof within 30 days after making such commitment. In such event this Lease shall continue in full force and effect, and Lessor shall proceed to make such repairs as soon as reasonably possible after the required funds are available. If Lessee does not make the required commitment, this Lease shall terminate as of the date specified in the termination notice. 

 9.4 Total Destruction. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if a Premises Total Destruction occurs, this Lease shall terminate 60 days following such Destruction. If the damage or destruction was caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Lessee, Lessor shall have the right to recover Lessor's damages from Lessee, except as provided in Paragraph 8.6. 

 9.5 Damage Near End of Term. If at any time during the last 6 months of this ease there is damage for which the cost to repair exceeds one month's Base Rent, whether or not an Insured Loss, Lessor may terminate this Lease effective 60 days following the date of occurrence of such damage by giving a written termination notice to Lessee within 30 days after the date of occurrence of such damage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Lessee at that time has an exercisable option to extend this Lease or to purchase the Premises, then Lessee may preserve this Lease by, (a) exercising such option and (b) providing Lessor with any shortage in insurance proceeds (or adequate assurance thereof) needed to make the repairs on or before the earlier of (i) the date which is 10 days after Lessee's receipt of Lessor's written notice purporting to terminate this Lease, or (ii) the day prior to the date upon which such option expires. If Lessee duly exercises such option during such period and provides Lessor with funds (or adequate assurance thereof) to cover any shortage in insurance proceeds, Lessor shall, at Lessor's commercially reasonable expense, repair such damage as soon as reasonably possible and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect. If Lessee fails to exercise such option and provide such funds or assurance during such period, then this Lease shall terminate on the date specified in the termination notice and Lessee's option shall be extinguished. 

 9.6 Abatement of Rent; Lessee's Remedies. 

 (a) Abatement. In the event of Premises Partial Damage or Premises Total Destruction or a Hazardous Substance Condition for which lessee is not responsible under this Lease, the Rent payable by Lessee for the period required for the repair, remediation or restoration of such damage shall be abated in proportion to the degree to which Lessee's use of the Premises is impaired, but not to exceed the proceeds received from the Rental Value insurance. All other obligations of Lessee hereunder shall be performed by Lessee, and Lessor shall have no liability for any such damage, destruction, remediation, repair or restoration except as provided herein. 

 (b) Remedies. If lessor is obligated to repair or restore the Premises and does not commence, in a substantial and meaningful way, such repair or restoration within 90 days after such obligation shall accrue, Lessee may, at any time prior to the commencement of such repair or restoration, give written notice to Lessor and to any Lenders of which Lessee has actual notice, of Lessee's election to terminate this Lease on a date not less than 60 days following the giving of such notice. If Lessee gives such notice and such repair or restoration is not commenced within 30 days thereafter, this Lease shall terminate as of the date specified in said notice. If the repair or restoration is commenced within such 30 days, this Lease shall continue in full force and effect. Commence shall mean either the unconditional authorization of the preparation of the required plans, or the beginning of the actual work on the Premises, whichever first occurs. 

 9.7 Termination; Advance Payments. Upon termination of this Lease pursuant to Paragraph 6.2(g) or Paragraph 9, an equitable adjustment shall be made concerning advance Base Rent and any other advance payments made by Lessee to Lessor. Lessor shall, in addition, return to Lessee so much of Lessee's Security Deposit as has not been, or is not then required to be, used by Lessor. 

10. Real Property Taxes. 

 10.1 Definitions. As used herein, the term Real Property Taxes shall include any form of assessment; real estate, general, special, ordinary or extraordinary, or rental levy or tax (other than inheritance, personal income or estate taxes); improvement bond; and/or license fee imposed upon or levied against any legal or equitable interest of Lessor in the Project, Lessor's right to other income therefrom, and/or Lessor's business of leasing, by any authority having the direct or indirect power to tax and where the funds are generated with reference to the Project address. Real Property Taxes shall also include any tax, fee, levy, assessment or charge, or any increase therein: (i) imposed by reason of events occurring during the term of this Lease, including but not limited to, a change in the ownership of the Project, (ii) a change in the improvements thereon, and/or (iii) levied or assessed on machinery or equipment provided by Lessor to Lessee pursuant to this Lease. 

 10.2 Payment of Taxes. Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 10.3, Lessor shall pay the Real Property Taxes applicable to the Project, and said payments shall be included in the calculation of Operating Expenses in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 4.2. 

 10.3 Additional Improvements . Operating Expenses shall not include Real Property Taxes specified in the tax assessor's records and work sheets as being caused by additional improvements placed upon the Project by other lessees or by lessor for the exclusive enjoyment of such other lessees. Notwithstanding Paragraph 10.2 hereof, Lessee shall, however, pay to Lessor at the time Operating Expenses are payable under Paragraph 4.2, the entirety of any increase in Real Property Taxes if assessed solely by reason of Alterations, Trade Fixtures or Utility Installations placed upon the Premises by Lessee or at Lessee's request or by reason of any alterations or improvements to the Premises made by Lessor subsequent to the execution of this Lease by the Parties. 

 10.4 Joint Assessment. If the Building is not separately assessed, Real Property Taxes allocated to the Building shall be an equitable proportion of the Real Property Taxes for all of the land and improvements included within the tax parcel assessed, such proportion to be determined by Lessor from the respective valuations assigned in the assessor's work sheets or such other information as may be reasonably available. Lessor's reasonable determination thereof, in good faith, shall be conclusive. 

 10.5 Personal Property Taxes. Lessee shall pay prior to delinquency all taxes assessed against and levied upon lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations, Trade Fixtures, furnishings, equipment and all personal property of Lessee contained in the Premises. When possible, Lessee shall cause its Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations, Trade Fixtures, furnishings, equipment and all other personal property to be assessed and billed separately from the real property of Lessor. If any of lessee's said property shall be assessed with Lessor's real property, Lessee shall pay lessor the taxes attributable to Lessee's property within 10 days after receipt of a written statement setting forth the taxes applicable to Lessee's property. 

11. Utilities and Services. 

9 of 18

11.1 Services Provided by Lessor. Lessor shall provide heating, ventilation, air conditioning, reasonable amounts of electricity for normal lighting and office machines, water for reasonable and normal drinking and lavatory use in connection with an office, and replacement light bulbs and/or fluorescent tubes and ballasts for standard overhead fixtures. Lessor shall also provide janitorial services to the Premises and Common Areas 5 times per week, excluding Building Holidays, or pursuant to the attached janitorial schedule, if any. Lessor shall not, however, be required to provide janitorial services to kitchens or storage areas included within the Premises. 

 11.2 Services Exclusive to Lessee. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 11.1, Lessee shall pay for all water, gas, light, power, telephone and other utilities and services specially or exclusively supplied and/or metered exclusively to the Premises or to Lessee, together with any taxes thereon. Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph 4.2(vi), if a service is deleted by Paragraph 1.13 and such service is not separately metered to the Premises, Lessee shall pay at Lessor's option, either Lessee's Share or a reasonable proportion to be determined by Lessor of all charges for such jointly metered service. 

 11.3 Hours of Service. Said services and utilities shall be provided during times set forth in Paragraph 1.12. Utilities and services required at other times shall be subject to advance request and reimbursement by Lessee to Lessor of the cost thereof. 

 11.4 Excess Usage by lessee. Lessee shall not make connection to the utilities except by or through existing outlets and shall not install or use machinery or equipment in or about the Premises that uses excess water, lighting or power, or suffer or permit any act that causes extra burden upon the utilities or services, including but not limited to security and trash services, over standard office usage for the Project. Lessor shall require Lessee to reimburse Lessor for any excess expenses or costs that may arise out of a breach of this subparagraph by Lessee. Lessor may, in its sole discretion, install at Lessee's expense supplemental equipment and/or separate metering applicable to Lessee's excess usage or loading. 

 11.5 Interruptions. There shall be no abatement of rent and Lessor shall not be liable in any respect whatsoever for the inadequacy, stoppage, interruption or discontinuance of any utility or service due to riot, strike, labor dispute, breakdown, accident, repair or other cause beyond Lessor's reasonable control or in cooperation with governmental request or directions. 

 11.6 Within fifteen days of Lessor's written request, Lessee agrees to deliver to Lessor such information, documents and/or authorization as Lessor needs in order for Lessor to comply with new or existing Applicable Requirements relating to commercial building energy usage, ratings, and/or the reporting thereof. 

12. Assignment and Subletting. 

 12.1 Lessor's Consent Required. 

 (a) Lessee shall not voluntarily or by operation of law assign, transfer, mortgage or encumber (collectively, assign or assignment or sublet all or any part of Lessee's interest in this Lease or in the Premises without Lessor's prior written consent. 

 (b) Unless Lessee is a corporation and its stock is publicly traded on a national stock exchange, a change in the control of Lessee shall constitute an assignment requiring consent. The transfer, on a cumulative basis, of 25 or more of the voting control of Lessee shall constitute a change in control for this purpose. 

 (c) The involvement of Lessee or its assets in any transaction, or series of transactions (by way of merger, sale, acquisition, financing, transfer, leveraged buyout or otherwise), whether or not a formal assignment or hypothecation of this Lease or Lessee's assets occurs, which results or will result in a reduction of the Net Worth of Lessee by an amount greater than 25 of such Net Worth as it was represented at the time of the execution of this Lease or at the time of the most recent assignment to which Lessor has consented, or as it exists immediately prior to said transaction or transactions constituting such reduction, whichever was or is greater, shall be considered an assignment of this Lease to which Lessor may withhold its consent. Net Worth of Lessee shall mean the net worth of Lessee (excluding any guarantors) established under generally accepted accounting principles. 

 (d) An assignment or subletting without consent shall, at Lessor's option, be a Default curable after notice per Paragraph 13.l(d). or a noncurable Breach without the necessity of any notice and grace period. If Lessor elects to treat such unapproved assignment or subletting as a noncurable Breach, Lessor may either: (i) terminate this Lease, or (ii) upon 30 days written notice, increase the monthly Base Rent to 110 of the Base Rent then in effect. Further, in the event of such Breach and rental adjustment, (i) the purchase price of any option to purchase the Premises held by Lessee shall be subject to similar adjustment to 110 of the price previously in effect, and (ii) all fixed and non-fixed rental adjustments scheduled during the remainder of the Lease term shall be increased to 110 of the scheduled adjusted rent. 

 (e) Lessee's remedy for any breach of Paragraph 12.1 by Lessor shall be limited to compensatory damages and/or injunctive relief. 

 (f) Lessor may reasonably withhold consent to a proposed assignment or subletting if Lessee is in Default at the time consent is requested. 

 (g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, allowing a de minimis portion of the Premises, ie. 20 square feet or less, to be used by a third party vendor in connection with the installation of a vending machine or payphone shall not constitute a subletting. 

 12.2 Terms and Conditions Applicable to Assignment and Subletting. 

 (a) Regardless of Lessor's consent, no assignment or subletting shall : (i) be effective without the express written assumption by such assignee or sublessee of the obligations of Lessee under this Lease, (ii) release Lessee of any obligations hereunder, or (iii) alter the primary liability of Lessee for the payment of Rent or for the performance of any other obligations to be performed by Lessee. 

 (b) Lessor may accept Rent or performance of Lessee's obligations from any person other than Lessee pending approval or disapproval of an assignment. Neither a delay in the approval or disapproval of such assignment nor the acceptance of Rent or performance shall constitute a waiver or estoppel of Lessor's right to exercise its remedies for Lessee's Default or Breach. 

 (c) Lessor's consent to any assignment or subletting shall not constitute a consent to any subsequent assignment or subletting. 

 (d) In the event of any Default or Breach by Lessee, Lessor may proceed directly against Lessee, any Guarantors or anyone else responsible for the performance of Lessee's obligations under this Lease, including any assignee or sublessee, without first exhausting Lessor's remedies against any other person or entity responsible therefor to Lessor, or any security held by Lessor. 

 (e) Each request for consent to an assignment or subletting shall be in writing, accompanied by information relevant to Lessor's determination as to the financial and operational responsibility and appropriateness of the proposed assignee or sublessee, including but not limited to the intended use and/or required modification of the Premises, if any, together with a fee of 500 as consideration for Lessor's considering and processing said request. Lessee agrees to provide Lessor with such other or additional information and/or documentation as may be reasonably requested. (See also Paragraph 36) 

 (f) Any assignee of, or sublessee under, this Lease shall, by reason of accepting such assignment, entering into such sublease, or entering into possession of the Premises or any portion thereof, be deemed to have assumed and agreed to conform and comply with each and every term, covenant, condition and obligation herein to be observed or performed by Lessee during the term of said assignment or sublease, other than such obligations as are contrary to or inconsistent with provisions of an assignment or sublease to which Lessor has specifically consented to in writing. 

 (g) Lessor's consent to any assignment or subletting shall not transfer to the assignee or sublessee any Option granted to the original Lessee by this Lease unless such transfer is specifically consented to by Lessor in writing. (See Paragraph 39.2) 

 12.3 Additional Terms and Conditions Applicable to Subletting. The following terms and conditions shall apply to any subletting by Lessee of all or any part of the Premises and shall be deemed included in all subleases under this Lease whether or not expressly incorporated therein: 

10 of 18

(a) Lessee hereby assigns and transfers to Lessor all of Lessee's interest in all Rent payable on any sublease, and Lessor may collect such Rent and apply same toward Lessee's obligations under this Lease; provided, however, that until a Breach shall occur in the performance of Lessee's obligations, Lessee may collect said Rent. In the event that the amount collected by Lessor exceeds Lessee's then outstanding obligations any such excess shall be refunded to Lessee. Lessor shall not, by reason of the foregoing or any assignment of such sublease, nor by reason of the collection of Rent, be deemed liable to the sublessee for any failure of Lessee to perform and comply with any of Lessee's obligations to such sublessee. Lessee hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs any such sublessee, upon receipt of a written notice from Lessor stating that a Breach exists in the performance of Lessee's obligations under this Lease, to pay to Lessor all Rent due and to become due under the sublease. Sublessee shall rely upon any such notice from Lessor and shall pay all Rents to Lessor without any obligation or right to inquire as to whether such Breach exists, notwithstanding any claim from Lessee to the contrary. 

 (b) In the event of a Breach by Lessee, Lessor may, at its option, require sublessee to attorn to Lessor, in which event Lessor shall undertake the obligations of the sublessor under such sublease from the time of the exercise of said option to the expiration of such sublease; provided, however, Lessor shall not be liable for any prepaid rents or security deposit paid by such sublessee to such sublessor or for any prior Defaults or Breaches of such sublessor. 

 (c) Any matter requiring the consent of the sublessor under a sublease shall also require the consent of Lessor. 

 (d) No sublessee shall further assign or sublet all or any part of the Premises without Lessor's prior written consent. 

 (e) Lessor shall deliver a copy of any notice of Default or Breach by Lessee to the sublessee, who shall have the right to cure the Default of Lessee within the grace period, if any, specified in such notice. The sublessee shall have a right of reimbursement and offset from and against Lessee for any such Defaults cured by the sublessee. 

13. Default; Breach; Remedies. 

 13.l Default; Breach. A Default is defined as a failure by the Lessee to comply with or perform any of the terms, covenants, conditions or Rules and Regulations under this Lease. A Breach is defined as the occurrence of one or more of the following Defaults, and the failure of Lessee to cure such Default within any applicable grace period: 

 (a) The abandonment of the Premises; or the vacating of the Premises without providing a commercially reasonable level of security, or where the coverage of the property insurance described in Paragraph 8.3 is jeopardized as a result thereof, or without providing reasonable assurances to minimize potential vandalism. 

 (b) The failure of Lessee to make any payment of Rent or any Security Deposit required to be made by Lessee hereunder, whether to Lessor or to a third party, when due, to provide reasonable evidence of insurance or surety bond, or to fulfill any obligation under this Lease which endangers or threatens life or property, where such failure continues for a period of 3 business days following written notice to Lessee. THE ACCEPTANCE BY LESSOR OF A PARTIAL PAYMENT OF RENT OR SECURITY DEPOSIT SHALL NOT CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF ANY OF LESSOR'S RIGHTS, INCLUDING LESSOR'S RIGHT TO RECOVER POSSESSION OF THE PREMISES. 

 (c) The failure of Lessee to allow Lessor and/or its agents access to the Premises or the commission of waste, act or acts constituting public or private nuisance, and/or an illegal activity on the Premises by Lessee, where such actions continue for a period of 3 business days following written notice to Lessee. In the event that Lessee commits waste, a nuisance or an illegal activity a second time then, the Lessor may elect to treat such conduct as a non-curable Breach rather than a Default. 

 (d) The failure by Lessee to provide (i) reasonable written evidence of compliance with Applicable Requirements, (ii) the service contracts, (iii) the rescission of an unauthorized assignment or subletting, (iv) an Estoppel Certificate or financial statements, (v) a requested subordination, (vi) evidence concerning any guaranty and/or Guarantor, (vii) any document requested under Paragraph 41, (viii) material safety data sheets (MSDS), or (ix) any other documentation or information which Lessor may reasonably require of Lessee under the terms of this Lease, where any such failure continues for a period of 10 days following written notice to Lessee. 

 (e) A Default by Lessee as to the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of this Lease, or of the rules adopted under Paragraph 2.9 hereof, other than those described in subparagraphs 13.l(a), (b) or (c), above, where such Default continues for a period of 30 days after written notice; provided, however, that if the nature of Lessee's Default is such that more than 30 days are reasonably required for its cure, then it shall not be deemed to be a Breach if Lessee commences such cure within said 30 day period and thereafter diligently prosecutes such cure to completion. 

 (f) The occurrence of any of the following events: (i) the making of any general arrangement or assignment for the benefit of creditors; (ii) becoming a debtor as defined in 11U.S.C. 101or any successor statute thereto (unless, in the case of a petition filed against Lessee, the same is dismissed within 60 days); (iii) the appointment of a trustee or receiver to take possession of substantially all of Lessee's assets located at the Premises or of Lessee's interest in this Lease, where possession is not restored to Lessee within 30 days; or (iv) the attachment, execution or other judicial seizure of substantially all of Lessee's assets located at the Premises or of Lessee's interest in this Lease, where such seizure is not discharged within 30 days; provided, however, in the event that any provision of this subparagraph is contrary to any applicable law, such provision shall be of no force or effect, and not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. 

 (g) The discovery that any financial statement of Lessee or of any Guarantor given to Lessor was materially false. 

 (h) If the performance of Lessee's obligations under this Lease is guaranteed: (i) the death of a Guarantor, (ii) the termination of a Guarantor's liability with respect to this Lease other than in accordance with the terms of such guaranty, (iii) a Guarantor's becoming insolvent or the subject of a bankruptcy filing, (iv) a Guarantor's refusal to honor the guaranty, or (v) a Guarantor's breach of its guaranty obligation on an anticipatory basis, and Lessee's failure, within 60 days following written notice of any such event, to provide written alternative assurance or security, which, when coupled with the then existing resources of Lessee, equals or exceeds the combined financial resources of Lessee and the Guarantors that existed at the time of execution of this Lease. 

 13.2 Remedies. If Lessee fails to perform any of its affirmative duties or obligations, within 10 days after written notice (or in case of an emergency, without notice), Lessor may, at its option, perform such duty or obligation on Lessee's behalf, including but not limited to the obtaining of reasonably required bonds, insurance policies, or governmental licenses, permits or approvals. Lessee shall pay to Lessor an amount equal to 115 of the costs and expenses incurred by Lessor in such performance upon receipt of an invoice therefor. In the event of a Breach, Lessor may, with or without further notice or demand, and without limiting Lessor in the exercise of any right or remedy which Lessor may have by reason of such Breach: 

 (a) Terminate Lessee's right to possession of the Premises by any lawful means, in which case this Lease shall terminate and Lessee shall immediately surrender possession to Lessor. In such event Lessor shall be entitled to recover from Lessee: (i) the unpaid Rent which had been earned at the time of termination; 

 (ii) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that the Lessee proves could have been reasonably avoided; (iii) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent for the balance of the term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that the Lessee proves could be reasonably avoided; and (iv) any other amount necessary to compensate Lessor for all the detriment proximately caused by the Lessee's failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom, including but not limited to the cost of recovering possession of the Premises, expenses of reletting, including necessary renovation and alteration of the Premises, reasonable attorneys' fees, and that portion of any leasing commission paid by Lessor in connection with this Lease applicable to the unexpired term of this Lease. The worth at the time of award of the amount referred to in provision (iii) of the immediately preceding 

11 of 18

sentence shall be computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of the District within which the Premises are located at the time of award plus one percent. Efforts by Lessor to mitigate damages caused by Lessee's Breach of this Lease shall not waive Lessor's right to recover any damages to which Lessor is otherwise entitled. If termination of this Lease is obtained through the provisional remedy of unlawful detainer, Lessor shall have the right to recover in such proceeding any unpaid Rent and damages as are recoverable therein, or Lessor may reserve the right to recover all or any part thereof in a separate suit. If a notice and grace period required under Paragraph 13.1was not previously given, a notice to pay rent or quit, or to perform or quit given to Lessee under the unlawful detainer statute shall also constitute the notice required by Paragraph 13.1. In such case, the applicable grace period required by Paragraph 13.1and the unlawful detainer statute shall run concurrently, and the failure of Lessee to cure the Default within the greater of the two such grace periods shall constitute both an unlawful detainer and a Breach of this Lease entitling Lessor to the remedies provided for in this Lease and/or by said statute. 

 (b) Continue the Lease and Lessee's right to possession and recover the Rent as it becomes due, in which event Lessee may sublet or assign, subject only to reasonable limitations. Acts of maintenance, efforts to relet, and/or the appointment of a receiver to protect the Lessor's interests, shall not constitute a termination of the Lessee's right to possession. 

 (c) Pursue any other remedy now or hereafter available under the laws or judicial decisions of the state wherein the Premises are located. The expiration or termination of this Lease and/or the termination of Lessee's right to possession shall not relieve Lessee from liability under any indemnity provisions of this Lease as to matters occurring or accruing during the term hereof or by reason of Lessee's occupancy of the Premises. 

 13.3 Inducement Recapture. Any agreement for free or abated rent or other charges, the cost of tenant improvements for Lessee paid for or performed by Lessor, or for the giving or paying by Lessor to or for Lessee of any cash or other bonus, inducement or consideration for Lessee's entering into this Lease, all of which concessions are hereinafter referred to as Inducement Provisions, shall be deemed conditioned upon Lessee's full and faithful performance of all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease. Upon Breach of this Lease by Lessee, any such Inducement Provision shall automatically be deemed deleted from this Lease and of no further force or effect, and any rent, other charge, bonus, inducement or consideration theretofore abated, given or paid by Lessor under such an Inducement Provision shall be immediately due and payable by Lessee to Lessor, notwithstanding any subsequent cure of said Breach by Lessee. The acceptance by Lessor of rent or the cure of the Breach which initiated the operation of this paragraph shall not be deemed a waiver by Lessor of the provisions of this paragraph unless specifically so stated in writing by Lessor at the time of such acceptance. 

 13.4 Late Charges. Lessee hereby acknowledges that late payment by Lessee of Rent will cause Lessor to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of which will be extremely difficult to ascertain. Such costs include, but are not limited to, processing and accounting charges, and late charges which may be imposed upon Lessor by any Lender. Accordingly, if any Rent shall not be received by Lessor within 5 days after such amount shall be due, then, without any requirement for notice to Lessee, Lessee shall immediately pay to Lessor a one-time late charge equal to 10 of each such overdue amount or 100, whichever is greater. The parties hereby agree that such late charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs Lessor will incur by reason of such late payment. Acceptance of such late charge by Lessor shall in no event constitute a waiver of Lessee's Default or Breach with respect to such overdue amount, nor prevent the exercise of any of the other rights and remedies granted hereunder. In the event that a late charge is payable hereunder, whether or not collected, for 3 consecutive installments of Base Rent, then notwithstanding any provision of this Lease to the contrary, Base Rent shall, at Lessor's option, become due and payable quarterly in advance. 

 13.5 Interest. Any monetary payment due Lessor hereunder, other than late charges, not received by Lessor, when due shall bear interest from the 31st day after it was due. The interest Interest charged shall be computed at the rate of 10 per annum but shall not exceed the maximum rate allowed by law. Interest is payable in addition to the potential late charge provided for in Paragraph 13.4. 

 13.6 Breach by Lessor. 

 (a) Notice of Breach. Lessor shall not be deemed in breach of this Lease unless Lessor fails within a reasonable time to perform an obligation required to be performed by Lessor. For purposes of this Paragraph, a reasonable time shall in no event be less than 30 days after receipt by Lessor, and any Lender whose name and address shall have been furnished to Lessee in writing for such purpose, of written notice specifying wherein such obligation of Lessor has not been performed; provided, however, that if the nature of Lessor's obligation is such that more than 30 days are reasonably required for its performance, then Lessor shall not be in breach if performance is commenced within such 30 day period and thereafter diligently pursued to completion. 

 (b) Performance by Lessee on Behalf of Lessor. In the event that neither Lessor nor Lender cures said breach within 30 days after receipt of said notice, or if having commenced said cure they do not diligently pursue it to completion, then Lessee may elect to cure said breach at Lessee's expense and offset from Rent the actual and reasonable cost to perform such cure, provided, however, that such offset shall not exceed an amount equal to the greater of one month's Base Rent or the Security Deposit, reserving Lessee's right to seek reimbursement from Lessor for any such expense in excess of such offset. Lessee shall document the cost of said cure and supply said documentation to Lessor. 

14. Condemnation. If the Premises or any portion thereof are taken under the power of eminent domain or sold under the threat of the exercise of said power (collectively Condemnation ), this Lease shall terminate as to the part taken as of the date the condemning authority takes title or possession, whichever first occurs. If more than 10 of the rentable floor area of the Premises, or more than 25 of Lessee's Reserved Parking Spaces, if any, are taken by Condemnation, Lessee may, at Lessee's option, to be exercised in writing within 10 days after Lessor shall have given Lessee written notice of such taking (or in the absence of such notice, within 10 days after the condemning authority shall have taken possession) terminate this Lease as of the date the condemning authority takes such possession. If Lessee does not terminate this Lease in accordance with the foregoing, this Lease shall remain in full force and effect as to the portion of the Premises remaining, except that the Base Rent shall be reduced in proportion to the reduction in utility of the Premises caused by such Condemnation. Condemnation awards and/or payments shall be the property of Lessor, whether such award shall be made as compensation for diminution in value of the leasehold, the value of the part taken, or for severance damages; provided, however, that Lessee shall be entitled to any compensation paid by the condemner for Lessee's relocation expenses, loss of business goodwill and/or Trade Fixtures, without regard to whether or not this Lease is terminated pursuant to the provisions of this Paragraph. All Alterations and Utility Installations made to the Premises by Lessee, for purposes of Condemnation only, shall be considered the property of the Lessee and Lessee shall be entitled to any and all compensation which is payable therefore. In the event that this Lease is not terminated by reason of the Condemnation, Lessor shall repair any damage to the Premises caused by such Condemnation. 

15. Brokerage Fees. 

 15.1 Additional Commission. In addition to the payments owed pursuant to Paragraph 1.10 above, Lessor agrees that: (a) if lessee exercises any Option, (b) if Lessee or anyone affiliated with Lessee acquires from Lessor any rights to the Premises or other premises owned by Lessor and located within the Project, (c) if Lessee remains in possession of the Premises, with the consent of Lessor, after the expiration of this Lease, or (d) if Base Rent is increased, whether by agreement or operation of an escalation clause herein, then, Lessor shall pay Brokers a fee in accordance with the fee schedule of the Brokers in effect at the time the Lease was executed. 

 15.2 Assumption of Obligations. Any buyer or transferee of Lessor's interest in this Lease shall be deemed to have assumed Lessor's obligation hereunder. Brokers shall be third party beneficiaries of the provisions of Paragraphs 1.10, 15, 22 and 31. If Lessor fails to pay to Brokers any amounts due as and for brokerage 

12 of 18

fees pertaining to this Lease when due, then such amounts shall accrue Interest. In addition, if Lessor fails to pay any amounts to Lessee's Broker when due, Lessee's Broker may send written notice to Lessor and Lessee of such failure and if Lessor fails to pay such amounts within 10 days after said notice, Lessee shall pay said monies to its Broker and offset such amounts against Rent. In addition, Lessee's Broker shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary of any commission agreement entered into by and/or between Lessor and Lessor's Broker for the limited purpose of collecting any brokerage fee owed. 

 15.3 Representations and Indemnities of Broker Relationships. Lessee and Lessor each represent and warrant to the other that it has had no dealings with any person, firm, broker, agent or finder (other than the Brokers and Agents, if any) in connection with this Lease, and that no one other than said named Brokers and Agents is entitled to any commission or tinder's fee in connection herewith. Lessee and Lessor do each hereby agree to indemnify, protect, defend and hold the other harmless from and against liability for compensation or charges which may be claimed by any such unnamed broker, finder or other similar party by reason of any dealings or actions of the indemnifying Party, including any costs, expenses, attorneys' fees reasonably incurred with respect thereto. 

16. Estoppel Certificates. 

 (a) Each Party (as Responding Party shall within 10 days after written notice from the other Party (the Requesting Party execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Requesting Party a statement in writing in form similar to the then most current Estoppel Certificate form published BY AIR CRE, plus such additional information, confirmation and/or statements as may be reasonably requested by the Requesting Party. 

 (b) If the Responding Party shall fail to execute or deliver the Estoppel Certificate within such 10 day period, the Requesting Party may execute an Estoppel Certificate stating that: (i) the Lease is in full force and effect without modification except as may be represented by the Requesting Party, (ii) there are no uncured defaults in the Requesting Party's performance, and (iii) if Lessor is the Requesting Party, not more than one month's rent has been paid in advance. Prospective purchasers and encumbrancers may rely upon the Requesting Party's Estoppel Certificate, and the Responding Party shall be estopped from denying the truth of the facts contained in said Certificate. In addition, Lessee acknowledges that any failure on its part to provide such an Estoppel Certificate will expose Lessor to risks and potentially cause Lessor to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the extent of which will be extremely difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, should the Lessee fail to execute and/or deliver a requested Estoppel Certificate in a timely fashion the monthly Base Rent shall be automatically increased, without any requirement for notice to Lessee, by an amount equal to 10 of the then existing Base Rent or 100, whichever is greater for remainder of the Lease. The Parties agree that such increase in Base Rent represents fair and reasonable compensation for the additional risk/costs that Lessor will incur by reason of Lessee's failure to provide the Estoppel Certificate. Such increase in Base Rent shall in no event constitute a waiver of Lessee's Default or Breach with respect to the failure to provide the Estoppel Certificate nor prevent the exercise of any of the other rights and remedies granted hereunder. 

 (c) If Lessor desires to finance, refinance, or sell the Premises, or any part thereof, Lessee and all Guarantors shall within 10 days after written notice from Lessor deliver to any potential lender or purchaser designated by Lessor such financial statements as may be reasonably required by such lender or purchaser, including but not limited to Lessee's financial statements for the past 3 years. All such financial statements shall be received by Lessor and such lender or purchaser in confidence and shall be used only for the purposes herein set forth. 

17. Definition of Lessor. The term Lessor as used herein shall mean the owner or owners at the time in question of the fee title to the Premises, or, if this is a sublease, of the Lessee's interest in the prior lease. In the event of a transfer of Lessor's title or interest in the Premises or this Lease, Lessor shall deliver to the transferee or assignee (in cash or by credit) any unused Security Deposit held by Lessor. Upon such transfer or assignment and delivery of the Security Deposit, as aforesaid, the prior Lessor shall be relieved of all liability with respect to the obligations and/or covenants under this Lease thereafter to be performed by the Lessor. Subject to the foregoing, the obligations and/or covenants in this Lease to be performed by the Lessor shall be binding only upon the Lessor as hereinabove defined. 

18. Severability. The invalidity of any provision of this Lease, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, shall in no way affect the validity of any other provision hereof. 

19. Days . Unless otherwise specifically indicated to the contrary, the word days as used in this Lease shall mean and refer to calendar days. 

20. Limitation on Liability. The obligations of Lessor under this Lease shall not constitute personal obligations of Lessor, or its partners, members, directors, officers or shareholders, and Lessee shall look to the Project, and to no other assets of Lessor, for the satisfaction of any liability of Lessor with respect to this Lease, and shall not seek recourse against Lessor's partners, members, directors, officers or shareholders, or any of their personal assets for such satisfaction. 

21. Time of Essence. Time is of the essence with respect to the performance of all obligations to be performed or observed by the Parties under this Lease. 

22. No Prior or Other Agreements; Broker Disclaimer. This Lease contains all agreements between the Parties with respect to any matter mentioned herein, and no other prior or contemporaneous agreement or understanding shall be effective. Lessor and Lessee each represents and warrants to the Brokers that it has made, and is relying solely upon, its own investigation as to the nature, quality, character and financial responsibility of the other Party to this Lease and as to the use, nature, quality and character of the Premises. Brokers have no responsibility with respect thereto or with respect to any default or breach hereof by either Party.

All notices required or permitted by this Lease or applicable law shall be in writing and may be delivered in person (by hand or by courier) or may be sent by regular. certified or registered mail or U.S. Postal Service Express Mail. with postage prepaid, or by facsimile transmission, or by email, and shall be deemed sufficiently given if served in a manner specified in this Paragraph 23. The addresses noted adjacent to a Party's signature on this Lease shall be that Party's address for delivery or mailing of notices. Either Party may by written notice to the other specify a different address for notice, except that upon Lessee's taking possession of the Premises, the Premises shall constitute Lessee's address for notice. A copy of all notices to Lessor shall be concurrently transmitted to such party or parties at such addresses as Lessor may from time to time hereafter designate in writing. 

 23.2 Date of Notice. Any notice sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, shall be deemed given on the date of delivery shown on the receipt card, or if no delivery date is shown, the postmark thereon.

24. Waivers. 

 (a) No waiver by Lessor of the Default or Breach of any term, covenant or condition hereof by Lessee, shall be deemed a waiver of any other term, 

13 of 18

covenant or condition hereof, or of any subsequent Default or Breach by Lessee of the same or of any other term, covenant or condition hereof. Lessor's consent to, or approval of, any act shall not be deemed to render unnecessary the obtaining of Lessor's consent to, or approval of, any subsequent or similar act by Lessee, or be construed as the basis of an estoppel to enforce the provision or provisions of this Lease requiring such consent. 

 (a) The acceptance of Rent by Lessor shall not be a waiver of any Default or Breach by Lessee. Any payment by Lessee may be accepted by Lessor on account of monies or damages due Lessor, notwithstanding any qualifying statements or conditions made by Lessee in connection therewith, which such statements and/or conditions shall be of no force or effect whatsoever unless specifically agreed to in writing by Lessor at or before the time of deposit of such payment. 

 (b) THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE TERMS OF THIS LEASE SHALL GOVERN WITH REGARD TO ALL MATTERS RELATED THERETO AND HEREBY WAIVE THE PROVISIONS OF ANY PRESENT OR FUTURE STATUTE TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH STATUTE IS INCONSISTENT WITH THIS LEASE. 

25. Disclosures Regarding The Nature of a Real Estate Agency Relationship. 

 (a) When entering into a discussion with a real estate agent regarding a real estate transaction, a Lessor or Lessee should from the outset understand what type of agency relationship or representation it has with the agent or agents in the transaction. Lessor and Lessee acknowledge being advised by the Brokers in this transaction, as follows: 

 (i) Lessor's Agent. A Lessor's agent under a listing agreement with the Lessor acts as the agent for the Lessor only. A Lessor's agent or subagent has the following affirmative obligations: To the Lessor: A fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty, and loyalty in dealings with the Lessor. To the Lessee and the L essor: (a) Diligent exercise of reasonable skills and care in performance of the agent's duties. (b) A duty of honest and fair dealing and good faith. (c) A duty to disclose all facts known to the agent materially affecting the value or desirability of the property that are not known to, or within the diligent attention and observation of, the Parties. An agent is not obligated to reveal to either Party any confidential information obtained from the other Party which does not involve the affirmative duties set forth above. 

 (ii) Lessee's A gent. An agent can agree to act as agent for the Lessee only. In these situations, the agent is not the Lessor's agent, even if by agreement the agent may receive compensation for services rendered, either in full or in part from the Lessor. An agent acting only for a Lessee has the following affirmative obligations. To the L essee: A fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty, and loyalty in dealings with the Lessee. To the Lessee and the Lessor: (a) Diligent exercise of reasonable skills and care in performance of the agent's duties. (b) A duty of honest and fair dealing and good faith. (c) A duty to disclose all facts known to the agent materially affecting the value or desirability of the property that are not known to, or within the diligent attention and observation of, the Parties. An agent is not obligated to reveal to either Party any confidential information obtained from the other Party which does not involve the affirmative duties set forth above. 

 (iii) Agent Representing Both Lessor and L essee. A real estate agent, either acting directly or through one or more associate licenses, can legally be the agent of both the Lessor and the Lessee in a transaction, but only with the knowledge and consent of both the Lessor and the Lessee. In a dual agency situation, the agent has the following affirmative obligations to both the Lessor and the Lessee: (a) A fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty in the dealings with either Lessor or the Lessee. (b) Other duties to the Lessor and the Lessee as stated above in subparagraphs (i) or (ii). In representing both Lessor and Lessee, the agent may not, without the express permission of the respective Party, disclose to the other Party confidential information, including, but not limited to, facts relating to either Lessee's or Lessor's financial position, motivations, bargaining position, or other personal information that may impact rent, including Lessor's willingness to accept a rent less than the listing rent or Lessee's willingness to pay rent greater than the rent offered. The above duties of the agent in a real estate transaction do not relieve a Lessor or Lessee from the responsibility to protect their own interests. Lessor and Lessee should carefully read all agreements to assure that they adequately express their understanding of the transaction. A real estate agent is a person qualified to advise about real estate. If legal or tax advice is desired, consult a competent professional. Both Lessor and Lessee should strongly consider obtaining tax advice from a competent professional because the federal and state tax consequences of a transaction can be complex and subject to change. 

 (b) Brokers have no responsibility with respect to any default or breach hereof by either Party. The Parties agree that no lawsuit or other legal proceeding involving any breach of duty, error or omission relating to this Lease may be brought against Broker more than one year after the Start Date and that the liability (including court costs and attorneys' fees), of any Broker with respect to any such lawsuit and/or legal proceeding shall not exceed the fee received by such Broker pursuant to this Lease; provided, however, that the foregoing limitation on each Broker's liability shall not be applicable to any gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Broker. 

 (c) Lessor and Lessee agree to identify to Brokers as Confidential any communication or information given Brokers that is considered by such Party to be confidential. 

26. No Right To Holdover. Lessee has no right to retain possession of the Premises or any part thereof beyond the expiration or termination of this Lease. In the event that Lessee holds over, then the Base Rent shall be increased to 150 of the Base Rent applicable immediately preceding the expiration or termination. Holdover Base Rent shall be calculated on a monthly basis. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as consent by Lessor to any holding over by Lessee. 

27. Cumulative Remedies . No remedy or election hereunder shall be deemed exclusive but shall, wherever possible, be cumulative with all other remedies at law or in equity. 

28. Covenants and Conditions; Construction of Agreement . All provisions of this Lease to be observed or performed by Lessee are both covenants and conditions. In construing this Lease, all headings and titles are for the convenience of the Parties only and shall not be considered a part of this Lease. Whenever required by the context, the singular shall include the plural and vice versa. This Lease shall not be construed as if prepared by one of the Parties, but rather according to its fair meaning as a whole, as if both Parties had prepared it. 

29. Binding Effect; Choice of Law . This Lease shall be binding upon the Parties, their personal representatives, successors and assigns and be governed by the laws of the State in which the Premises are located. Any litigation between the Parties hereto concerning this Lease shall be initiated in the county in which the Premises are located. Signatures to this Lease accomplished by means of electronic signature or similar technology shall be legal and binding. 

30. Subordination; Attornment; Non-Disturbance. 

 30.1 Subordination . This Lease and any Option granted hereby shall be subject and subordinate to any ground lease, mortgage, deed of trust, or other hypothecation or security device (collectively, Security Device ), now or hereafter placed upon the Premises, to any and all advances made on the security thereof, and to all renewals, modifications, and extensions thereof. Lessee agrees that the holders of any such Security Devices (in this Lease together referred to as Lender shall have no liability or obligation to perform any of the obligations of Lessor under this Lease. Any Lender may elect to have this Lease and/or any Option granted hereby superior to the lien of its Security Device by giving written notice thereof to Lessee, whereupon this Lease and such Options shall be deemed prior to such Security Device, notwithstanding the relative dates of the documentation or recordation thereof. 

 30.2 Attornment . In the event that Lessor transfers title to the Premises, or the Premises are acquired by another upon the foreclosure or termination of a Security Device to which this Lease is subordinated (i) Lessee shall, subject to the non-disturbance provisions of Paragraph 30.3, attorn to such new owner, and upon 

14 of 18

request, enter into a new lease, containing all of the terms and provisions of this Lease, with such new owner for the remainder of the term hereof, or, at the election of the new owner, this Lease will automatically become a new lease between Lessee and such new owner, and (ii) Lessor shall thereafter be relieved of any further obligations hereunder and such new owner shall assume all of Lessor's obligations, except that such new owner shall not: (a) be liable for any act or omission of any prior lessor or with respect to events occurring prior to acquisition of ownership; (b) be subject to any offsets or defenses which Lessee might have against any prior lessor, (c) be bound by prepayment of more than one month's rent, or (d) be liable for the return of any security deposit paid to any prior lessor which was not paid or credited to such new owner. 

 30.3 Non-Disturbance.

Further, within 60 days after the execution of this Lease, Lessor shall, if requested by Lessee, use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a Non-Disturbance Agreement from the holder of any pre-existing Security Device which is secured by the Premises. In the event that Lessor is unable to provide the Non-Disturbance Agreement within said 60 days, then Lessee may, at Lessee's option, directly contact Lender and attempt to negotiate for the execution and delivery of a Non-Disturbance Agreement. 

 30.4 Self-Executing. The agreements contained in this Paragraph 30 shall be effective without the execution of any further documents; provided, however, that, upon written request from Lessor or a Lender in connection with a sale, financing or refinancing of the Premises, Lessee and Lessor shall execute such further writings as may be reasonably required to separately document any subordination, attornment and/or Non-Disturbance Agreement provided for herein. 

31. Attorneys' Fees. If any Party or Broker brings an action or proceeding involving the Premises whether founded in tort, contract or equity, or to declare rights hereunder, the Prevailing Party (as hereafter defined) in any such proceeding, action, or appeal thereon, shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees. Such fees may be awarded in the same suit or recovered in a separate suit, whether or not such action or proceeding is pursued to decision or judgment. The term, Prevailing Party shall include, without limitation, a Party or Broker who substantially obtains or defeats the relief sought, as the case may be, whether by compromise, settlement, judgment, or the abandonment by the other Party or Broker of its claim or defense. The attorneys' fees award shall not be computed in accordance with any court fee schedule, but shall be such as to fully reimburse all attorneys' fees reasonably incurred. In addition, Lessor shall be entitled to attorneys' fees, costs and expenses incurred in the preparation and service of notices of Default and consultations in connection therewith, whether or not a legal action is subsequently commenced in connection with such Default or resulting Breach 200 is a reasonable minimum per occurrence for such services and consultation).

35. Termination; Merger.

Lessor's consent to any act, assignment or subletting shall not constitute an acknowledgment that no Default or Breach by Lessee of this Lease exists, nor shall such consent be deemed a waiver of any then existing Default or Breach, except as may be otherwise specifically stated in writing by Lessor at the time of such consent. The failure to specify herein any particular condition to Lessor's consent shall not preclude the imposition by Lessor at the time of consent of such further or other conditions as are then reasonable with reference to the particular matter for which consent is being given. In the event that either Party disagrees with any determination made by the other hereunder and reasonably requests the reasons for such determination, the determining party shall furnish its reasons in writing and in reasonable detail within 10 business days following such request.

Premises. 

2.1 Letting . Lessor hereby leases to Lessee, and Lessee hereby leases from Lessor, the Premises, for the term, at the rental, and upon all of the terms, covenants and conditions set forth in this Lease. While the approximate square footage of the Premises may have been used in the marketing of the Premises for purposes of comparison, the Base Rent stated herein is NOT tied to square footage and is not subject to adjustment should the actual size be determined to be different. NOTE: Lessee is advised to verify the actual size prior to executing this Lease. 

 2.2 Condition . Lessor shall deliver that portion of the Premises contained within the Building (" Unit ") to Lessee broom clean and free of debris on the Commencement Date or the Early Possession Date, whichever first occurs (" Start Date "), and, so long as the required service contracts described in Paragraph 7.1(b) below are obtained by Lessee and in effect within thirty days following the Start Date, warrants that the existing electrical, plumbing, fire sprinkler, lighting, heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems (" HVAC "), loading doors, sump pumps, if any, and all other such elements in the Unit, other than those constructed by Lessee, shall be in good operating condition on said date, that the structural elements of the roof, bearing walls and foundation of the Unit shall be free of material defects, and that the Unit does not contain hazardous levels of any mold or fungi defined as toxic under applicable state or federal law. If a non-compliance with such warranty exists as of the Start Date, or if one of such systems or elements should malfunction or fail within the appropriate warranty period, Lessor shall, as Lessor's sole obligation with respect to such matter, except as otherwise provided in this Lease, promptly after receipt of written notice from Lessee setting forth with specificity the nature and extent of such non-compliance, malfunction or failure, rectify same at Lessor's expense. The warranty periods shall be as follows: (i) 6 months as to the HVAC systems, and (ii) 30 days as to the remaining systems and other elements of the Unit. If Lessee does not give Lessor the required notice within the appropriate warranty period, correction of any such non-compliance, malfunction or failure shall be the obligation of Lessee at Lessee's sole cost and expense (except for the repairs to the fire sprinkler systems, roof, foundations, and/or bearing walls - see Paragraph 7). Lessor also warrants, that unless otherwise specified in writing, Lessor is unaware of (i) any recorded Notices of Default affecting the Premise; (ii) any delinquent amounts due under any loan secured by the Premises; and 

 (iii) any bankruptcy proceeding affecting the Premises. 

 2.3 Compliance . Lessor warrants that to the best of its knowledge the improvements on the Premises and the Common Areas comply with the building codes, applicable laws, covenants or restrictions of record, regulations, and ordinances (" Applicable Requirements ") that were in effect at the time that each improvement, or portion thereof, was constructed. Said warranty does not apply to the use to which Lessee will put the Premises, modifications which may be required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any similar laws as a result of Lessee's use (see Paragraph 49), or to any Alterations or Utility Installations (as defined in Paragraph 7.3(a)) made or to be made by Lessee. NOTE: Lessee is responsible for determining whether or not the Applicable Requirements, and especially the zoning are appropriate for Lessee's intended use, and acknowledges that past uses of the Premises may no longer be allowed. If the Premises do not comply with said warranty, Lessor shall, except as otherwise provided, promptly after receipt of written notice from Lessee setting forth with specificity the nature and extent of such non-compliance, rectify the same at Lessor's expense. If Lessee does not give Lessor written notice of a non-compliance with this warranty within 6 months following the Start Date, correction of that non-compliance shall be the obligation of Lessee at Lessee's sole cost and expense. If the Applicable Requirements are hereafter changed so as to require during the term of this Lease the construction of an addition to or an alteration of the Unit, Premises and/or Building, the remediation of any Hazardous Substance, or the reinforcement or other physical modification of the Unit, Premises and/or Building (" Capital Expenditure "), Lessor and Lessee shall allocate the cost of such work as follows: 

 (a) Subject to Paragraph 2.3(c) below, if such Capital Expenditures are required as a result of the specific and unique use of the Premises by Lessee as compared with uses by tenants in general, Lessee shall be fully responsible for the cost thereof, provided, however, that if such Capital Expenditure is required during the last 2 years of this Lease and the cost thereof exceeds 6 months' Base Rent, Lessee may instead terminate this Lease unless Lessor notifies Lessee, in writing, within 10 days after receipt of Lessee's termination notice that Lessor has elected to pay the difference between the actual cost thereof and the amount equal to 6 months' Base Rent. If Lessee elects termination, Lessee shall immediately cease the use of the Premises which requires such Capital Expenditure and deliver to Lessor written notice specifying a termination date at least 90 days thereafter. Such termination date shall, however, in no event be earlier than the last day that Lessee could legally utilize the Premises without commencing such Capital Expenditure. 

 (b) If such Capital Expenditure is not the result of the specific and unique use of the Premises by Lessee (such as, governmentally mandated seismic modifications), then Lessor shall pay for such Capital Expenditure and Lessee shall only be obligated to pay, each month during the remainder of the term of this Lease or any extension thereof, on the date that on which the Base Rent is due, an amount equal to 1/144th of the portion of such costs reasonably attributable to the Premises. Lessee shall pay Interest on the balance but may prepay its obligation at any time. If, however, such Capital Expenditure is required during the last 2 years of this Lease or if Lessor reasonably determines that it is not economically feasible to pay its share thereof, Lessor shall have the option to terminate this Lease upon 90 days prior written notice to Lessee unless Lessee notifies Lessor, in writing, within 10 days after receipt of Lessor's termination notice that Lessee will pay for such Capital Expenditure. If Lessor does not elect to terminate, and fails to tender its share of any such Capital Expenditure, Lessee may advance such funds and deduct same, with Interest, from Rent until Lessor's share of such costs have been fully paid. If Lessee is unable to finance Lessor's share, or if the balance of the Rent due and payable for the remainder of this Lease is not sufficient to fully reimburse Lessee on an offset basis, Lessee shall have the right to terminate this Lease upon 30 days written notice to Lessor. 

 (c) Notwithstanding the above, the provisions concerning Capital Expenditures are intended to apply only to non-voluntary, unexpected, and new Applicable Requirements. If the Capital Expenditures are instead triggered by Lessee as a result of an actual or proposed change in use, change in intensity of use, or modification to the Premises then, and in that event, Lessee shall either: (i) immediately cease such changed use or intensity of use and/or take such other steps as may be necessary to eliminate the requirement for such Capital Expenditure, or (ii) complete such Capital Expenditure at its own expense. Lessee shall not have any right to terminate this Lease. 

 2.4 Acknowledgements . Lessee acknowledges that: (a) it has been given an opportunity to inspect and measure the Premises; (b) it has been advised by Lessor and/or Brokers to satisfy itself with respect to the size and condition of the Premises (including but not limited to the electrical, HVAC and fire sprinkler systems, security, environmental aspects, and compliance with Applicable Requirements and the Americans with Disabilities Act), and their suitability for Lessee's intended use; (c) Lessee has made such investigation as it deems necessary with reference to such matters and assumes all responsibility therefor as the same relate to its occupancy of the Premises; (d) it is not relying on any representation as to the size of the Premises made by Brokers or Lessor; (e) the square footage of the Premises was not material to Lessee's decision to lease the Premises and pay the Rent stated herein; and (f) neither Lessor, Lessor's agents, nor Brokers have made any oral or written representations or warranties with respect to said matters other than as set forth in this Lease. In addition, Lessor acknowledges that: (i) Brokers have made no representations, promises or warranties concerning Lessee's ability to honor the Lease or suitability to occupy the Premises, and (ii) it is Lessor's sole responsibility to investigate the financial capability and/or suitability of all proposed tenants. 

2 of 18

2.5 Lessee as Prior Owner/Occupant . The warranties made by Lessor in Paragraph 2 shall be of no force or effect if immediately prior to the Start Date Lessee was the owner or occupant of the Premises. In such event, Lessee shall be responsible for any necessary corrective work. 

 2.6 Vehicle Parking . Lessee shall be entitled to use the number of Parking Spaces specified in Paragraph 1.2(b) on those portions of the Common Areas designated from time to time by Lessor for parking. Lessee shall not use more parking spaces than said number. Said parking spaces shall be used for parking by vehicles no larger than full-size passenger automobiles or pick-up trucks, herein called " Permitted Size Vehicles ." Lessor may regulate the loading and unloading of vehicles by adopting Rules and Regulations as provided in Paragraph 2.9. No vehicles other than Permitted Size Vehicles may be parked in the Common Area without the prior written permission of Lessor. In addition: 

 (a) Lessee shall not permit or allow any vehicles that belong to or are controlled by Lessee or Lessee's employees, suppliers, shippers, customers, contractors or invitees to be loaded, unloaded, or parked in areas other than those designated by Lessor for such activities. 

 (b) Lessee shall not service or store any vehicles in the Common Areas. 

 (c) If Lessee permits or allows any of the prohibited activities described in this Paragraph 2.6, then Lessor shall have the right, without notice, in addition to such other rights and remedies that it may have, to remove or tow away the vehicle involved and charge the cost to Lessee, which cost shall be immediately payable upon demand by Lessor. 

 2.7 Common Areas - Definition . The term " Common Areas " is defined as all areas and facilities outside the Premises and within the exterior boundary line of the Project and interior utility raceways and installations within the Unit that are provided and designated by the Lessor from time to time for the general 

 non-exclusive use of Lessor, Lessee and other tenants of the Project and their respective employees, suppliers, shippers, customers, contractors and invitees, including parking areas, loading and unloading areas, trash areas, roofs, roadways, walkways, driveways and landscaped areas. 

 2.8 Common Areas - Lessee's Rights . Lessor grants to Lessee, for the benefit of Lessee and its employees, suppliers, shippers, contractors, customers and invitees, during the term of this Lease, the non-exclusive right to use, in common with others entitled to such use, the Common Areas as they exist from time to time, subject to any rights, powers, and privileges reserved by Lessor under the terms hereof or under the terms of any rules and regulations or restrictions governing the use of the Project. Under no circumstances shall the right herein granted to use the Common Areas be deemed to include the right to store any property, temporarily or permanently, in the Common Areas. Any such storage shall be permitted only by the prior written consent of Lessor or Lessor's designated agent, which consent may be revoked at any time. In the event that any unauthorized storage shall occur, then Lessor shall have the right, without notice, in addition to such other rights and remedies that it may have, to remove the property and charge the cost to Lessee, which cost shall be immediately payable upon demand by Lessor. 

 2.9 Common Areas - Rules and Regulations . Lessor or such other person(s) as Lessor may appoint shall have the exclusive control and management of the Common Areas and shall have the right, from time to time, to establish, modify, amend and enforce reasonable rules and regulations (" Rules and Regulations ") for the management, safety, care, and cleanliness of the grounds, the parking and unloading of vehicles and the preservation of good order, as well as for the convenience of other occupants or tenants of the Building and the Project and their invitees. Lessee agrees to abide by and conform to all such Rules and Regulations, and shall use its best efforts to cause its employees, suppliers, shippers, customers, contractors and invitees to so abide and conform. Lessor shall not be responsible to Lessee for the non-compliance with said Rules and Regulations by other tenants of the Project.

3. 

Term. 

3.1 Term . The Commencement Date, Expiration Date and Original Term of this Lease are as specified in Paragraph 1.3. 

 3.2 Early Possession . Any provision herein granting Lessee Early Possession of the Premises is subject to and conditioned upon the Premises being available for such possession prior to the Commencement Date. Any grant of Early Possession only conveys a non-exclusive right to occupy the Premises. If Lessee totally or partially occupies the Premises prior to the Commencement Date, the obligation to pay Base Rent shall be abated for the period of such Early Possession. All other terms of this Lease (including but not limited to the obligations to pay Lessee's Share of Common Area Operating Expenses, Real Property Taxes and insurance premiums and to maintain the Premises) shall be in effect during such period. Any such Early Possession shall not affect the Expiration Date. 

 3.3 Delay In Possession . Lessor agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver exclusive possession of the Premises to Lessee by the Commencement Date. If, despite said efforts, Lessor is unable to deliver possession by such date, Lessor shall not be subject to any liability therefor, nor shall such failure affect the validity of this Lease or change the Expiration Date. Lessee shall not, however, be obligated to pay Rent or perform its other obligations until Lessor delivers possession of the Premises and any period of rent abatement that Lessee would otherwise have enjoyed shall run from the date of delivery of possession and continue for a period equal to what Lessee would otherwise have enjoyed under the terms hereof, but minus any days of delay caused by the acts or omissions of Lessee. If possession is not delivered within 60 days after the Commencement Date, as the same may be extended under the terms of any Work Letter executed by Parties, Lessee may, at its option, by notice in writing within 10 days after the end of such 60 day period, cancel this Lease, in which event the Parties shall be discharged from all obligations hereunder. If such written notice is not received by Lessor within said 10 day period, Lessee's right to cancel shall terminate. If possession of the Premises is not delivered within 120 days after the Commencement Date, this Lease shall terminate unless other agreements are reached between Lessor and Lessee, in writing. 

 3.4 Lessee Compliance . Lessor shall not be required to tender possession of the Premises to Lessee until Lessee complies with its obligation to provide evidence of insurance (Paragraph 8.5). Pending delivery of such evidence, Lessee shall be required to perform all of its obligations under this Lease from and after the Start Date, including the payment of Rent, notwithstanding Lessor's election to withhold possession pending receipt of such evidence of insurance. Further, if Lessee is required to perform any other conditions prior to or concurrent with the Start Date, the Start Date shall occur but Lessor may elect to withhold possession until such conditions are satisfied. 

4. 

Rent. 

4.1. Rent Defined . All monetary obligations of Lessee to Lessor under the terms of this Lease (except for the Security Deposit) are deemed to be rent (" Rent "). 

 4.2 Common Area Operating Expenses . Lessee shall pay to Lessor during the term hereof, in addition to the Base Rent, Lessee's Share (as specified in Paragraph 1.6) of all Common Area Operating Expenses, as hereinafter defined, during each calendar year of the term of this Lease, in accordance with the following provisions: 

3 of 18

(a) 

The following costs relating to the ownership and operation of the Project are defined as " Common Area Operating Expenses ": 

(i) Costs relating to the operation, repair and maintenance, in neat, clean, good order and condition, but not the replacement (see subparagraph (e)), of the following: 

 (aa) The Common Areas and Common Area improvements, including parking areas, loading and unloading areas, trash areas, roadways, parkways, walkways, driveways, landscaped areas, bumpers, irrigation systems, Common Area lighting facilities, fences and gates, elevators, roofs, exterior walls of the buildings, building systems and roof drainage systems. 

 (bb) Exterior signs and any tenant directories. (cc) Any fire sprinkler systems. 

 (dd) All other areas and improvements that are within the exterior boundaries of the Project but outside of the Premises and/or any other space occupied by a tenant. 

(ii) 

The cost of water, gas, electricity and telephone to service the Common Areas and any utilities not separately metered. 

(iii) 

The cost of trash disposal, pest control services, property management, security services, owners' association dues and fees, the cost to repaint the exterior of any structures and the cost of any environmental inspections. 

(iv) 

Reserves set aside for maintenance and repair of Common Areas and Common Area equipment. 

(v) 

Any increase above the Base Real Property Taxes (as defined in Paragraph 10). 

(vi) 

Any "Insurance Cost Increase" (as defined in Paragraph 8). 

(vii) 

Any deductible portion of an insured loss concerning the Building or the Common Areas. 

(viii) 

Auditors', accountants' and attorneys' fees and costs related to the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the Project. 

(ix) 

The cost of any capital improvement to the Building or the Project not covered under the provisions of Paragraph 2.3 provided; however, that Lessor shall allocate the cost of any such capital improvement over a 12 year period and Lessee shall not be required to pay more than Lessee's Share of 1/144th of the cost of such capital improvement in any given month. Lessee shall pay Interest on the unamortized balance but may prepay its obligation at any time. 

(x) 

The cost of any other services to be provided by Lessor that are stated elsewhere in this Lease to be a Common Area Operating Expense. 

(b) Any Common Area Operating Expenses and Real Property Taxes that are specifically attributable to the Unit, the Building or to any other building in the Project or to the operation, repair and maintenance thereof, shall be allocated entirely to such Unit, Building, or other building. However, any Common Area Operating Expenses and Real Property Taxes that are not specifically attributable to the Building or to any other building or to the operation, repair and maintenance thereof, shall be equitably allocated by Lessor to all buildings in the Project. 

 (c) The inclusion of the improvements, facilities and services set forth in Subparagraph 4.2(a) shall not be deemed to impose an obligation upon Lessor to either have said improvements or facilities or to provide those services unless the Project already has the same, Lessor already provides the services, or Lessor has agreed elsewhere in this Lease to provide the same or some of them. 

 (d) Lessee's Share of Common Area Operating Expenses is payable monthly on the same day as the Base Rent is due hereunder. The amount of such payments shall be based on Lessor's estimate of the annual Common Area Operating Expenses. Within 60 days after written request (but not more than once each year) Lessor shall deliver to Lessee a reasonably detailed statement showing Lessee's Share of the actual Common Area Operating Expenses for the preceding year. If Lessee's payments during such year exceed Lessee's Share, Lessor shall credit the amount of such over-payment against Lessee's future payments. If Lessee's payments during such year were less than Lessee's Share, Lessee shall pay to Lessor the amount of the deficiency within 10 days after delivery by Lessor to Lessee of the statement. 

 (e) Common Area Operating Expenses shall not include the cost of replacing equipment or capital components such as the roof, foundations, exterior walls or Common Area capital improvements, such as the parking lot paving, elevators, fences that have a useful life for accounting purposes of 5 years or more. 

 (f) Common Area Operating Expenses shall not include any expenses paid by any tenant directly to third parties, or as to which Lessor is otherwise reimbursed by any third party, other tenant, or insurance proceeds. 

 4.3 Payment . Lessee shall cause payment of Rent to be received by Lessor in lawful money of the United States, without offset or deduction (except as specifically permitted in this Lease), on or before the day on which it is due. All monetary amounts shall be rounded to the nearest whole dollar. In the event that any statement or invoice prepared by Lessor is inaccurate such inaccuracy shall not constitute a waiver and Lessee shall be obligated to pay the amount set forth in this Lease. Rent for any period during the term hereof which is for less than one full calendar month shall be prorated based upon the actual number of days of said month. Payment of Rent shall be made to Lessor at its address stated herein or to such other persons or place as Lessor may from time to time designate in writing. Acceptance of a payment which is less than the amount then due shall not be a waiver of Lessor's rights to the balance of such Rent, regardless of Lessor's endorsement of any check so stating. In the event that any check, draft, or other instrument of payment given by Lessee to Lessor is dishonored for any reason, Lessee agrees to pay to Lessor the sum of 25 in addition to any Late Charge and Lessor, at its option, may require all future Rent be paid by cashier's check. Payments will be applied first to accrued late charges and attorney's fees, second to accrued interest, then to Base Rent and Common Area Operating Expenses, and any remaining amount to any other outstanding charges or costs. 

5. Security Deposit. Lessee shall deposit with Lessor upon execution hereof the Security Deposit as security for Lessee's faithful performance of its obligations under this Lease. If Lessee fails to pay Rent, or otherwise Defaults under this Lease, Lessor may use, apply or retain all or any portion of said Security Deposit for the payment of any amount already due Lessor, for Rents which will be due in the future, and/ or to reimburse or compensate Lessor for any liability, expense, loss or damage which Lessor may suffer or incur by reason thereof. If Lessor uses or applies all or any portion of the Security Deposit, Lessee shall within 10 days after written request therefor deposit monies with Lessor sufficient to restore said Security Deposit to the full amount required by this Lease. If the Base Rent increases during the term of this Lease, Lessee shall, upon written request from Lessor, deposit additional monies with Lessor so that the total amount of the Security Deposit shall at all times bear the same proportion to the increased Base Rent as the initial Security Deposit bore to the initial Base Rent. Should the Agreed Use be amended to accommodate a material change in the business of Lessee or to accommodate a sublessee or assignee, Lessor shall have the right to increase the Security Deposit to the extent necessary, in Lessor's reasonable judgment, to account for any increased wear and tear that the Premises may suffer as a result thereof. If a change in control of Lessee occurs during this Lease and following such change the financial condition of Lessee is, in Lessor's reasonable judgment, significantly reduced, Lessee shall deposit such additional monies with Lessor as shall be sufficient to cause the Security Deposit to be at a commercially reasonable level based on such change in financial condition. Lessor shall not be required to keep the Security Deposit separate from its general accounts. Within 90 days after the expiration or termination of this Lease, Lessor shall return that portion of the Security Deposit not used or applied by Lessor. Lessor shall upon written request provide Lessee with an accounting showing how that portion of the Security Deposit that was not returned was applied. No part of the Security Deposit shall be considered to be held in trust, to bear interest or to be prepayment for any monies to be paid by Lessee under this Lease. THE SECURITY DEPOSIT SHALL NOT BE USED BY LESSEE IN LIEU OF PAYMENT OF THE LAST MONTH'S RENT.

6. 

Use. 

6.1 Use . Lessee shall use and occupy the Premises only for the Agreed Use, or any other legal use which is reasonably comparable thereto, and for no other purpose. Lessee shall not use or permit the use of the Premises in a manner that is unlawful, creates damage, waste or a nuisance, or that disturbs occupants of or causes damage to neighboring premises or properties. Other than guide, signal and seeing eye dogs, Lessee shall not keep or allow in the Premises any pets, animals, birds, fish, or reptiles. Lessor shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to any written request for a modification of the Agreed Use, so long as the same will not impair the structural integrity of the Building or the mechanical or electrical systems therein, and/or is not significantly more burdensome to the Project. If Lessor elects to withhold consent, Lessor shall within 7 days after such request give written notification of same, which notice shall include an explanation of Lessor's objections to the change in the Agreed Use. Under no circumstance may Lessee use any portion of the Premises for the sale, storage, use, growing or cultivation of marijuana or marijuana related products. 

 6.2 Hazardous Substances. 

 (a) Reportable Uses Require Consent . The term " Hazardous Substance " as used in this Lease shall mean any product, substance, or waste whose presence, use, manufacture, disposal, transportation, or release, either by itself or in combination with other materials expected to be on the Premises, is either: (i) potentially injurious to the public health, safety or welfare, the environment or the Premises; (ii) regulated or monitored by any governmental authority, or (iii) a basis for potential liability of Lessor to any governmental agency or third party under any applicable statute or common law theory. Hazardous Substances shall include, but not be limited to, hydrocarbons, petroleum, gasoline, and/or crude oil or any products, by-products or fractions thereof. Lessee shall not engage in any activity in or on the Premises which constitutes a Reportable Use of Hazardous Substances without the express prior written consent of Lessor and timely compliance (at Lessee's expense) with all Applicable Requirements. " Reportable Use " shall mean (i) the installation or use of any above or below ground storage tank; (ii) the generation, possession, storage, use, transportation, or disposal of a Hazardous Substance that requires a permit from, or with respect to which a report, notice, registration or business plan is required to be filed with, any governmental authority, and/or (iii) the presence at the Premises of a Hazardous Substance with respect to which any Applicable Requirements requires that a notice be given to persons entering or occupying the Premises or neighboring properties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessee may use any ordinary and customary materials reasonably required to be used in the normal course of the Agreed Use, ordinary office supplies (copier toner, liquid paper, glue, etc.) and common household cleaning materials, so long as such use is in compliance with all Applicable Requirements, is not a Reportable Use, and does not expose the Premises or neighboring property to any meaningful risk of contamination or damage or expose Lessor to any liability therefor. In addition, Lessor may condition its consent to any Reportable Use upon receiving such additional assurances as Lessor reasonably deems necessary to protect itself, the public, the Premises and/or the environment against damage, contamination, injury and/or liability, including, but not limited to, the installation (and removal on or before Lease expiration or termination) of protective modifications (such as concrete encasements) and/or increasing the Security Deposit. 

 (b) Duty to Inform Lessor . If Lessee knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, that a Hazardous Substance has come to be located in, on, under or about the Premises, other than as previously consented to by Lessor, Lessee shall immediately give written notice of such fact to Lessor, and provide Lessor with a copy of any report, notice, claim or other documentation which it has concerning the presence of such Hazardous Substance. 

 (c) Lessee Remediation . Lessee shall not cause or permit any Hazardous Substance to be spilled or released in, on, under, or about the Premises (including through the plumbing or sanitary sewer system) and shall promptly, at Lessee's expense, comply with all Applicable Requirements and take all investigatory and/or remedial action reasonably recommended, whether or not formally ordered or required, for the cleanup of any contamination of, and for the maintenance, security and/or monitoring of the Premises or neighboring properties, that was caused or materially contributed to by Lessee, or pertaining to or involving any Hazardous Substance brought onto the Premises during the term of this Lease, by or for Lessee, or any third party. 

 (d) Lessee Indemnification . Lessee shall indemnify, defend and hold Lessor, its agents, employees, lenders and ground lessor, if any, harmless from and against any and all loss of rents and/or damages, liabilities, judgments, claims, expenses, penalties, and attorneys' and consultants' fees arising out of or involving any Hazardous Substance brought onto the Premises by or for Lessee, or any third party (provided, however, that Lessee shall have no liability under this Lease with respect to underground migration of any Hazardous Substance under the Premises from areas outside of the Project not caused or contributed to by Lessee). Lessee's obligations shall include, but not be limited to, the effects of any contamination or injury to person, property or the environment created or suffered by Lessee, and the cost of investigation, removal, remediation, restoration and/or abatement, and shall survive the expiration or termination of this Lease. No termination, cancellation or release agreement entered into by Lessor and Lessee shall release Lessee from its obligations under this Lease with respect to Hazardous Substances, unless specifically so agreed by Lessor in writing at the time of such agreement. 

 (e) Lessor Indemnification . Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 8.7, Lessor and its successors and assigns shall indemnify, defend, reimburse and hold Lessee, its employees and lenders, harmless from and against any and all environmental damages, including the cost of remediation, which are suffered as a direct result of Hazardous Substances on the Premises prior to Lessee taking possession or which are caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Lessor, its agents or employees. Lessor's obligations, as and when required by the Applicable Requirements, shall include, but not be limited to, the cost of investigation, removal, remediation, restoration and/or abatement, and shall survive the expiration or termination of this Lease. 

 (f) Investigations and Remediations . Lessor shall retain the responsibility and pay for any investigations or remediation measures required by governmental entities having jurisdiction with respect to the existence of Hazardous Substances on the Premises prior to the Lessee taking possession, unless such remediation measure is required as a result of Lessee's use (including "Alterations", as defined in paragraph 7.3(a) below) of the Premises, in which event Lessee shall be responsible for such payment. Lessee shall cooperate fully in any such activities at the request of Lessor, including allowing Lessor and Lessor's agents to have reasonable access to the Premises at reasonable times in order to carry out Lessor's investigative and remedial responsibilities. 

 (g) Lessor Termination Option . If a Hazardous Substance Condition (see Paragraph 9.1(e)) occurs during the term of this Lease, unless Lessee is legally responsible therefor (in which case Lessee shall make the investigation and remediation thereof required by the Applicable Requirements and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect, but subject to Lessor's rights under Paragraph 6.2(d) and Paragraph 13), Lessor may, at Lessor's option, either (i) investigate and remediate such Hazardous Substance Condition, if required, as soon as reasonably possible at Lessor's expense, in which event this Lease shall continue in full force and effect, or (ii) if the estimated cost to remediate such condition exceeds 12 times the then monthly Base Rent or 100,000, whichever is greater, give written notice to Lessee, within 30 days after receipt by Lessor of knowledge of the occurrence of such Hazardous Substance Condition, of Lessor's desire to terminate this Lease as of the date 60 days following the date of such notice. In the event Lessor elects to give a termination notice, Lessee may, within 10 days thereafter, give written notice to Lessor of Lessee's commitment to pay the amount by which the cost of the remediation of such Hazardous Substance Condition exceeds an amount equal to 12 times the then monthly Base Rent or 100,000, whichever is greater. Lessee shall provide Lessor with said funds or satisfactory assurance thereof within 30 days following such commitment. In such event, this Lease shall continue in full force and effect, and Lessor shall proceed to make such remediation as soon as reasonably possible after the required funds are available. If Lessee does not give such notice and provide the required funds or assurance thereof within the time provided, this Lease shall terminate as of the date specified in Lessor's notice of termination. 

 6.3 Lessee's Compliance with Applicable Requirements . Except as otherwise provided in this Lease, Lessee shall, at Lessee's sole expense, fully, diligently and in a timely manner, materially comply with all Applicable Requirements, the requirements of any applicable fire insurance underwriter or rating bureau, and the recommendations of Lessor's engineers and/or consultants which relate in any manner to the Premises, without regard to whether said Applicable Requirements are now in effect or become effective after the Start Date. Lessee shall, within 10 days after receipt of Lessor's written request, provide Lessor with copies of all permits 

5 of 18

and other documents, and other information evidencing Lessee's compliance with any Applicable Requirements specified by Lessor, and shall immediately upon receipt, notify Lessor in writing (with copies of any documents involved) of any threatened or actual claim, notice, citation, warning, complaint or report pertaining to or involving the failure of Lessee or the Premises to comply with any Applicable Requirements. Likewise, Lessee shall immediately give written notice to Lessor of: (i) any water damage to the Premises and any suspected seepage, pooling, dampness or other condition conducive to the production of mold; or (ii) any mustiness or other odors that might indicate the presence of mold in the Premises. 

 6.4 Inspection; Compliance . Lessor and Lessor's " Lender " (as defined in Paragraph 30) and consultants authorized by Lessor shall have the right to enter into Premises at any time in the case of an emergency, and otherwise at reasonable times after reasonable notice, for the purpose of inspecting and/or testing the condition of the Premises and/or for verifying compliance by Lessee with this Lease. The cost of any such inspections shall be paid by Lessor, unless a violation of Applicable Requirements, or a Hazardous Substance Condition (see Paragraph 9.1(e)) is found to exist or be imminent, or the inspection is requested or ordered by a governmental authority. In such case, Lessee shall upon request reimburse Lessor for the cost of such inspection, so long as such inspection is reasonably related to the violation or contamination. In addition, Lessee shall provide copies of all relevant material safety data sheets MSDS to Lessor within 10 days of the receipt of written request therefor. Lessee acknowledges that any failure on its part to allow such inspections or testing will expose Lessor to risks and potentially cause Lessor to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the extent of which will be extremely difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, should the Lessee fail to allow such inspections and/or testing in a timely fashion the Base Rent shall be automatically increased, without any requirement for notice to Lessee, by an amount equal to 10 of the then existing Base Rent or 100, whichever is greater for the remainder to the Lease. The Parties agree that such increase in Base Rent represents fair and reasonable compensation for the additional risk/costs that Lessor will incur by reason of Lessee's failure to allow such inspection and/or testing. Such increase in Base Rent shall in no event constitute a waiver of Lessee's Default or Breach with respect to such failure nor prevent the exercise of any of the other rights and remedies granted hereunder. 

7. 

Maintenance; Repairs; Utility Installations; Trade Fixtures and Alterations. 

7.1 Lessee's Obligations . 

 (a) In General .

Lessee, in keeping the Premises in good order, condition and repair, shall exercise and perform good maintenance practices, specifically including the procurement and maintenance of the service contracts required by Paragraph 7.1(b) below. Lessee's obligations shall include restorations, replacements or renewals when necessary to keep the Premises and all improvements thereon or a part thereof in good order, condition and state of repair. HVAC shall be in good working condition upon move in date.

However, Lessor reserves the right, upon notice to Lessee, to procure and maintain any or all of such service contracts, and Lessee shall reimburse Lessor, upon demand, for the cost thereof. 

 (c) Failure to Perform . If Lessee fails to perform Lessee's obligations under this Paragraph 7.1, Lessor may enter upon the Premises after 10 days' prior written notice to Lessee (except in the case of an emergency, in which case no notice shall be required), perform such obligations on Lessee's behalf, and put the Premises in good order, condition and repair, and Lessee shall promptly pay to Lessor a sum equal to 115 of the cost thereof. 

 (d) Replacement . Subject to Lessee's indemnification of Lessor as set forth in Paragraph 8.7 below, and without relieving Lessee of liability resulting from Lessee's failure to exercise and perform good maintenance practices, if an item described in Paragraph 7.1(b) cannot be repaired other than at a cost which is in excess of 50 of the cost of replacing such item, then such item shall be replaced by Lessor, and the cost thereof shall be prorated between the Parties and Lessee shall only be obligated to pay, each month during the remainder of the term of this Lease or any extension thereof, on the date on which Base Rent is due, an amount equal to the product of multiplying the cost of such replacement by a fraction, the numerator of which is one, and the denominator of which is 144 (i.e. 1/144th of the cost per month). Lessee shall pay Interest on the unamortized balance but may prepay its obligation at any time. 

 7.2 Lessor's Obligations . Subject to the provisions of Paragraphs 2.2 (Condition), 2.3 (Compliance), 4.2 (Common Area Operating Expenses), 6 (Use), 7.1 (Lessee's Obligations), 9 (Damage or Destruction) and 14 (Condemnation), Lessor, subject to reimbursement pursuant to Paragraph 4.2, shall keep in good order, condition and repair the foundations, exterior walls, structural condition of interior bearing walls, exterior roof, fire sprinkler system, Common Area fire alarm and/or smoke detection systems, fire hydrants, parking lots, walkways, parkways, driveways, landscaping, fences, signs and utility systems serving the Common Areas and all parts thereof, as well as providing the services for which there is a Common Area Operating Expense pursuant to Paragraph 4.2. Lessor shall not be obligated to paint the exterior or interior surfaces of exterior walls nor shall Lessor be obligated to maintain, repair or replace windows, doors or plate glass of the Premises. 

 7.3 Utility Installations; Trade Fixtures; Alterations . 

 (a) Definitions . The term " Utility Installations " refers to all floor and window coverings, air and/or vacuum lines, power panels, electrical distribution, security and fire protection systems, communication cabling, lighting fixtures, HVAC equipment, plumbing, and fencing in or on the Premises. The term " Trade Fixtures " shall mean Lessee's machinery and equipment that can be removed without doing material damage to the Premises. The term "Alterations" shall mean any modification of the improvements, other than Utility Installations or Trade Fixtures, whether by addition or deletion. " Lessee Owned Alterations and/or Utility Installations " are defined as Alterations and/or Utility Installations made by Lessee that are not yet owned by Lessor pursuant to Paragraph 7.4(a). 

 (b) Consent . Lessee shall not make any Alterations or Utility Installations to the Premises without Lessor's prior written consent. Lessee may, however, make non-structural Alterations or Utility Installations to the interior of the Premises (excluding the roof) without such consent but upon notice to Lessor, as long as they are not visible from the outside, do not involve puncturing, relocating or removing the roof or any existing walls, will not affect the electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and/or life safety systems, do not trigger the requirement for additional modifications and/or improvements to the Premises resulting from Applicable Requirements, such as compliance with Title 24, and the cumulative cost thereof during this Lease as extended does not exceed a sum equal to 3 month's Base Rent in the aggregate or a sum equal to one month's Base Rent in any one year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessee shall not make or permit any roof penetrations and/or install anything on the roof without the prior written approval of Lessor. Lessor may, as a precondition to granting such approval, require Lessee to utilize a contractor chosen and/or approved by Lessor. Any Alterations or Utility Installations that Lessee shall desire to make and which require the consent of the Lessor shall be presented to Lessor in written form with detailed plans. Consent shall be deemed conditioned upon Lessee's: (i) acquiring all applicable governmental permits, (ii) furnishing Lessor with copies of both the permits and the plans and specifications prior to commencement of the work, and (iii) compliance with all conditions of said permits and other Applicable Requirements in a prompt and expeditious manner. Any Alterations or Utility Installations shall be performed in a workmanlike manner 

6 of 18

with good and sufficient materials. Lessee shall promptly upon completion furnish Lessor with as-built plans and specifications. For work which costs an amount in excess of one month's Base Rent, Lessor may condition its consent upon Lessee providing a lien and completion bond in an amount equal to 150 of the estimated cost of such Alteration or Utility Installation and/or upon Lessee's posting an additional Security Deposit with Lessor. 

 (c) Liens; Bonds . Lessee shall pay, when due, all claims for labor or materials furnished or alleged to have been furnished to or for Lessee at or for use on the Premises, which claims are or may be secured by any mechanic's or materialmen's lien against the Premises or any interest therein. Lessee shall give Lessor not less than 10 days notice prior to the commencement of any work in, on or about the Premises, and Lessor shall have the right to post notices of non-responsibility. If Lessee shall contest the validity of any such lien, claim or demand, then Lessee shall, at its sole expense defend and protect itself, Lessor and the Premises against the same and shall pay and satisfy any such adverse judgment that may be rendered thereon before the enforcement thereof. If Lessor shall require, Lessee shall furnish a surety bond in an amount equal to 150 of the amount of such contested lien, claim or demand, indemnifying Lessor against liability for the same. If Lessor elects to participate in any such action, Lessee shall pay Lessor's attorneys' fees and costs. 

 7.4 Ownership; Removal; Surrender; and Restoration . 

 (a) Ownership . Subject to Lessor's right to require removal or elect ownership as hereinafter provided, all Alterations and Utility Installations made by Lessee shall be the property of Lessee, but considered a part of the Premises. Lessor may, at any time, elect in writing to be the owner of all or any specified part of the Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations. Unless otherwise instructed per paragraph 7.4(b) hereof, all Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations shall, at the expiration or termination of this Lease, become the property of Lessor and be surrendered by Lessee with the Premises. 

 (b) Removal . By delivery to Lessee of written notice from Lessor not earlier than 90 and not later than 30 days prior to the end of the term of this Lease, Lessor may require that any or all Lessee Owned Alterations or Utility Installations be removed by the expiration or termination of this Lease. Lessor may require the removal at any time of all or any part of any Lessee Owned Alterations or Utility Installations made without the required consent. 

 (c) Surrender; Restoration . Lessee shall surrender the Premises by the Expiration Date or any earlier termination date, with all of the improvements, parts and surfaces thereof broom clean and free of debris, and in good operating order, condition and state of repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted. "Ordinary wear and tear" shall not include any damage or deterioration that would have been prevented by good maintenance practice. Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of Paragraph 7.1(a), if the Lessee occupies the Premises for 12 months or less, then Lessee shall surrender the Premises in the same condition as delivered to Lessee on the Start Date with NO allowance for ordinary wear and tear. Lessee shall repair any damage occasioned by the installation, maintenance or removal of Trade Fixtures, Lessee owned Alterations and/or Utility Installations, furnishings, and equipment as well as the removal of any storage tank installed by or for Lessee. Lessee shall also remove from the Premises any and all Hazardous Substances brought onto the Premises by or for Lessee, or any third party (except Hazardous Substances which were deposited via underground migration from areas outside of the Premises) to the level specified in Applicable Requirements. Trade Fixtures shall remain the property of Lessee and shall be removed by Lessee. Any personal property of Lessee not removed on or before the Expiration Date or any earlier termination date shall be deemed to have been abandoned by Lessee and may be disposed of or retained by Lessor as Lessor may desire. The failure by Lessee to timely vacate the Premises pursuant to this Paragraph 7.4(c) without the express written consent of Lessor shall constitute a holdover under the provisions of Paragraph 26 below. 

8. 

Insurance; Indemnity. 

8.1 Payment of Premium Increases . 

 (a) As used herein, the term " Insurance Cost Increase " is defined as any increase in the actual cost of the insurance applicable to the Building and/or the Project and required to be carried by Lessor, pursuant to Paragraphs 8.2(b), 8.3(a) and 8.3(b), over and above the Base Premium, as hereinafter defined, calculated on an annual basis. Insurance Cost Increase shall include, but not be limited to, requirements of the holder of a mortgage or deed of trust covering the Premises, Building and/or Project, increased valuation of the Premises, Building and/or Project, and/or a general premium rate increase. The term Insurance Cost Increase shall not, however, include any premium increases resulting from the nature of the occupancy of any other tenant of the Building. The " Base Premium " shall be the annual premium applicable to the 12 month period immediately preceding the Start Date. If, however, the Project was not insured for the entirety of such 12 month period, then the Base Premium shall be the lowest annual premium reasonably obtainable for the Required Insurance as of the Start Date, assuming the most nominal use possible of the Building. In no event, however, shall Lessee be responsible for any portion of the premium cost attributable to liability insurance coverage in excess of 2,000,000 procured under Paragraph 8.2(b). 

 (b) Lessee shall pay any Insurance Cost Increase to Lessor pursuant to Paragraph 4.2. Premiums for policy periods commencing prior to, or extending beyond, the term of this Lease shall be prorated to coincide with the corresponding Start Date or Expiration Date. 

 8.2 Liability Insurance . 

 (a) Carried by Lessee . Lessee shall obtain and keep in force a Commercial General Liability policy of insurance protecting Lessee and Lessor as an additional insured against claims for bodily injury, personal injury and property damage based upon or arising out of the ownership, use, occupancy or maintenance of the Premises and all areas appurtenant thereto. Such insurance shall be on an occurrence basis providing single limit coverage in an amount not less than 1,000,000 per occurrence with an annual aggregate of not less than 2,000,000. Lessee shall add Lessor as an additional insured by means of an endorsement at least as broad as the Insurance Service Organization's "Additional Insured-Managers or Lessors of Premises" Endorsement. The policy shall not contain any intra-insured exclusions as between insured persons or organizations, but shall include coverage for liability assumed under this Lease as an " insured contract " for the performance of Lessee's indemnity obligations under this Lease. The limits of said insurance shall not, however, limit the liability of Lessee nor relieve Lessee of any obligation hereunder. Lessee shall provide an endorsement on its liability policy(ies) which provides that its insurance shall be primary to and not contributory with any similar insurance carried by Lessor, whose insurance shall be considered excess insurance only. 

 (b) Carried by Lessor . Lessor shall maintain liability insurance as described in Paragraph 8.2(a), in addition to, and not in lieu of, the insurance required to be maintained by Lessee. Lessee shall not be named as an additional insured therein. 

 8.3 Property Insurance - Building, Improvements and Rental Value . 

 (a) Building and Improvements . Lessor shall obtain and keep in force a policy or policies of insurance in the name of Lessor, with loss payable to Lessor, any ground-lessor, and to any Lender insuring loss or damage to the Premises. The amount of such insurance shall be equal to the full insurable replacement cost of the Premises, as the same shall exist from time to time, or the amount required by any Lender, but in no event more than the commercially reasonable and available insurable value thereof. Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations, Trade Fixtures, and Lessee's personal property shall be insured by Lessee not by Lessor. If the coverage is available and commercially appropriate, such policy or policies shall insure against all risks of direct physical loss or damage (except the perils of flood and/or earthquake unless required by a Lender), including coverage for debris removal and the enforcement of any Applicable Requirements requiring the upgrading, demolition, reconstruction or replacement of any portion of the Premises as the result of a covered loss. Said policy or policies shall also contain an agreed valuation provision in lieu of any coinsurance clause, waiver of subrogation, and inflation guard protection causing an increase in the annual property insurance coverage amount by a factor of not less than the adjusted U.S. Department of Labor Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers for the city nearest to where the Premises are located. If such insurance coverage has a deductible clause, the deductible amount shall not exceed 5,000 per occurrence. 

 (b) Rental Value . Lessor shall also obtain and keep in force a policy or policies in the name of Lessor with loss payable to Lessor and any Lender, insuring 

7 of 18

the loss of the full Rent for one year with an extended period of indemnity for an additional 180 days ("Rental Value insurance"). Said insurance shall contain an agreed valuation provision in lieu of any coinsurance clause, and the amount of coverage shall be adjusted annually to reflect the projected Rent otherwise payable by Lessee, for the next 12 month period. 

 (c) Adjacent Premises . Lessee shall pay for any increase in the premiums for the property insurance of the Building and for the Common Areas or other buildings in the Project if said increase is caused by Lessee's acts, omissions, use or occupancy of the Premises. 

 (d) Lessee's Improvements . Since Lessor is the Insuring Party, Lessor shall not be required to insure Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations unless the item in question has become the property of Lessor under the terms of this Lease. 

 8.4 Lessee's Property; Business Interruption Insurance; Worker's Compensation Insurance . 

 (a) Property Damage . Lessee shall obtain and maintain insurance coverage on all of Lessee's personal property, Trade Fixtures, and Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations. Such insurance shall be full replacement cost coverage with a deductible of not to exceed 1,000 per occurrence. The proceeds from any such insurance shall be used by Lessee for the replacement of personal property, Trade Fixtures and Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations. 

 (b) Business Interruption . Lessee shall obtain and maintain loss of income and extra expense insurance in amounts as will reimburse Lessee for direct or indirect loss of earnings attributable to all perils commonly insured against by prudent lessees in the business of Lessee or attributable to prevention of access to the Premises as a result of such perils. 

 (c) Worker's Compensation Insurance . Lessee shall obtain and maintain Worker's Compensation Insurance in such amount as may be required by Applicable Requirements. Such policy shall include a 'Waiver of Subrogation' endorsement. Lessee shall provide Lessor with a copy of such endorsement along with the certificate of insurance or copy of the policy required by paragraph 8.5. 

 (d) No Representation of Adequate Coverage . Lessor makes no representation that the limits or forms of coverage of insurance specified herein are adequate to cover Lessee's property, business operations or obligations under this Lease. 

 8.5 Insurance Policies . Insurance required herein shall be by companies maintaining during the policy term a "General Policyholders Rating" of at least A-, VII, as set forth in the most current issue of "Best's Insurance Guide", or such other rating as may be required by a Lender. Lessee shall not do or permit to be done anything which invalidates the required insurance policies. Lessee shall, prior to the Start Date, deliver to Lessor certified copies of policies of such insurance or certificates with copies of the required endorsements evidencing the existence and amounts of the required insurance. No such policy shall be cancelable or subject to modification except after 30 days prior written notice to Lessor. Lessee shall, at least 10 days prior to the expiration of such policies, furnish Lessor with evidence of renewals or "insurance binders" evidencing renewal thereof, or Lessor may increase his liability insurance coverage and charge the cost thereof to Lessee, which amount shall be payable by Lessee to Lessor upon demand. Such policies shall be for a term of at least one year, or the length of the remaining term of this Lease, whichever is less. If either Party shall fail to procure and maintain the insurance required to be carried by it, the other Party may, but shall not be required to, procure and maintain the same. 

 8.6 Waiver of Subrogation . Without affecting any other rights or remedies, Lessee and Lessor each hereby release and relieve the other, and waive their entire right to recover damages against the other, for loss of or damage to its property arising out of or incident to the perils required to be insured against herein. The effect of such releases and waivers is not limited by the amount of insurance carried or required, or by any deductibles applicable hereto. The Parties agree to have their respective property damage insurance carriers waive any right to subrogation that such companies may have against Lessor or Lessee, as the case may be, so long as the insurance is not invalidated thereby. 

 8.7 Indemnity . Except for Lessor's gross negligence or willful misconduct, Lessee shall indemnify, protect, defend and hold harmless the Premises, Lessor and its agents, Lessor's master or ground lessor, partners and Lenders, from and against any and all claims, loss of rents and/or damages, liens, judgments, penalties, attorneys' and consultants' fees, expenses and/or liabilities arising out of, involving, or in connection with, a Breach of the Lease by Lessee and/or the use and/or occupancy of the Premises and/or Project by Lessee and/or by Lessee's employees, contractors or invitees. If any action or proceeding is brought against Lessor by reason of any of the foregoing matters, Lessee shall upon notice defend the same at Lessee's expense by counsel reasonably satisfactory to Lessor and Lessor shall cooperate with Lessee in such defense. Lessor need not have first paid any such claim in order to be defended or indemnified. 

 8.8 Exemption of Lessor and its Agents from Liability . Notwithstanding the negligence or breach of this Lease by Lessor or its agents, neither Lessor nor its agents shall be liable under any circumstances for: (i) injury or damage to the person or goods, wares, merchandise or other property of Lessee, Lessee's employees, contractors, invitees, customers, or any other person in or about the Premises, whether such damage or injury is caused by or results from fire, steam, electricity, gas, water or rain, indoor air quality, the presence of mold or from the breakage, leakage, obstruction or other defects of pipes, fire sprinklers, wires, appliances, plumbing, HVAC or lighting fixtures, or from any other cause, whether the said injury or damage results from conditions arising upon the Premises or upon other portions of the Building, or from other sources or places; (ii) any damages arising from any act or neglect of any other tenant of Lessor or from the failure of Lessor or its agents to enforce the provisions of any other lease in the Project; or (iii) injury to Lessee's business or for any loss of income or profit therefrom. Instead, it is intended that Lessee's sole recourse in the event of such damages or injury be to file a claim on the insurance policy(ies) that Lessee is required to maintain pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 8. 

 8.9 Failure to Provide Insurance . Lessee acknowledges that any failure on its part to obtain or maintain the insurance required herein will expose Lessor to risks and potentially cause Lessor to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the extent of which will be extremely difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, for any month or portion thereof that Lessee does not maintain the required insurance and/or does not provide Lessor with the required binders or certificates evidencing the existence of the required insurance, the Base Rent shall be automatically increased, without any requirement for notice to Lessee, by an amount equal to 10 of the then existing Base Rent or 100, whichever is greater. The parties agree that such increase in Base Rent represents fair and reasonable compensation for the additional risk/costs that Lessor will incur by reason of Lessee's failure to maintain the required insurance. Such increase in Base Rent shall in no event constitute a waiver of Lessee's Default or Breach with respect to the failure to maintain such insurance, prevent the exercise of any of the other rights and remedies granted hereunder, nor relieve Lessee of its obligation to maintain the insurance specified in this Lease. 

9. 

Damage or Destruction. 

9.1 Definitions . 

 (a) " Premises Partial Damage " shall mean damage or destruction to the improvements on the Premises, other than Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations, which can reasonably be repaired in 3 months or less from the date of the damage or destruction, and the cost thereof does not exceed a sum equal to 6 month's Base Rent. Lessor shall notify Lessee in writing within 30 days from the date of the damage or destruction as to whether or not the damage is Partial or Total. 

 (b) " Premises Total Destruction " shall mean damage or destruction to the improvements on the Premises, other than Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations and Trade Fixtures, which cannot reasonably be repaired in 3 months or less from the date of the damage or destruction and/or the cost thereof exceeds a sum equal to 6 month's Base Rent. Lessor shall notify Lessee in writing within 30 days from the date of the damage or destruction as to whether or not the damage is Partial or Total. 

 (c) " Insured Loss " shall mean damage or destruction to improvements on the Premises, other than Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations and Trade Fixtures, which was caused by an event required to be covered by the insurance described in Paragraph 8.3(a), irrespective of any deductible amounts or coverage limits involved. 

8 of 18

(d) " Replacement Cost " shall mean the cost to repair or rebuild the improvements owned by Lessor at the time of the occurrence to their condition existing immediately prior thereto, including demolition, debris removal and upgrading required by the operation of Applicable Requirements, and without deduction for depreciation. 

 (e) " Hazardous Substance Condition " shall mean the occurrence or discovery of a condition involving the presence of, or a contamination by, a Hazardous Substance, in, on, or under the Premises which requires restoration. 

 9.2 Partial Damage - Insured Loss . If a Premises Partial Damage that is an Insured Loss occurs, then Lessor shall, at Lessor's expense, repair such damage (but not Lessee's Trade Fixtures or Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations) as soon as reasonably possible and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect; provided, however, that Lessee shall, at Lessor's election, make the repair of any damage or destruction the total cost to repair of which is 10,000 or less, and, in such event, Lessor shall make any applicable insurance proceeds available to Lessee on a reasonable basis for that purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the required insurance was not in force or the insurance proceeds are not sufficient to effect such repair, the Insuring Party shall promptly contribute the shortage in proceeds as and when required to complete said repairs. In the event, however, such shortage was due to the fact that, by reason of the unique nature of the improvements, full replacement cost insurance coverage was not commercially reasonable and available, Lessor shall have no obligation to pay for the shortage in insurance proceeds or to fully restore the unique aspects of the Premises unless Lessee provides Lessor with the funds to cover same, or adequate assurance thereof, within 10 days following receipt of written notice of such shortage and request therefor. If Lessor receives said funds or adequate assurance thereof within said 10 day period, the party responsible for making the repairs shall complete them as soon as reasonably possible and this Lease shall remain in full force and effect. If such funds or assurance are not received, Lessor may nevertheless elect by written notice to Lessee within 10 days thereafter to: (i) make such restoration and repair as is commercially reasonable with Lessor paying any shortage in proceeds, in which case this Lease shall remain in full force and effect, or (ii) have this Lease terminate 30 days thereafter. Lessee shall not be entitled to reimbursement of any funds contributed by Lessee to repair any such damage or destruction. Premises Partial Damage due to flood or earthquake shall be subject to Paragraph 9.3, notwithstanding that there may be some insurance coverage, but the net proceeds of any such insurance shall be made available for the repairs if made by either Party. 

 9.3 Partial Damage - Uninsured Loss . If a Premises Partial Damage that is not an Insured Loss occurs, unless caused by a negligent or willful act of Lessee (in which event Lessee shall make the repairs at Lessee's expense), Lessor may either: (i) repair such damage as soon as reasonably possible at Lessor's expense (subject to reimbursement pursuant to Paragraph 4.2), in which event this Lease shall continue in full force and effect, or (ii) terminate this Lease by giving written notice to Lessee within 30 days after receipt by Lessor of knowledge of the occurrence of such damage. Such termination shall be effective 60 days following the date of such notice. In the event Lessor elects to terminate this Lease, Lessee shall have the right within 10 days after receipt of the termination notice to give written notice to Lessor of Lessee's commitment to pay for the repair of such damage without reimbursement from Lessor. Lessee shall provide Lessor with said funds or satisfactory assurance thereof within 30 days after making such commitment. In such event this Lease shall continue in full force and effect, and Lessor shall proceed to make such repairs as soon as reasonably possible after the required funds are available. If Lessee does not make the required commitment, this Lease shall terminate as of the date specified in the termination notice. 

 9.4 Total Destruction . Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if a Premises Total Destruction occurs, this Lease shall terminate 60 days following such Destruction. If the damage or destruction was caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Lessee, Lessor shall have the right to recover Lessor's damages from Lessee, except as provided in Paragraph 8.6. 

 9.5 Damage Near End of Term . If at any time during the last 6 months of this Lease there is damage for which the cost to repair exceeds one month's Base Rent, whether or not an Insured Loss, Lessor may terminate this Lease effective 60 days following the date of occurrence of such damage by giving a written termination notice to Lessee within 30 days after the date of occurrence of such damage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Lessee at that time has an exercisable option to extend this Lease or to purchase the Premises, then Lessee may preserve this Lease by (a) exercising such option and (b) providing Lessor with any shortage in insurance proceeds (or adequate assurance thereof) needed to make the repairs on or before the earlier of (i) the date which is 10 days after Lessee's receipt of Lessor's written notice purporting to terminate this Lease, or (ii) the day prior to the date upon which such option expires. If Lessee duly exercises such option during such period and provides Lessor with funds (or adequate assurance thereof) to cover any shortage in insurance proceeds, Lessor shall, at Lessor's commercially reasonable expense, repair such damage as soon as reasonably possible and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect. If Lessee fails to exercise such option and provide such funds or assurance during such period, then this Lease shall terminate on the date specified in the termination notice and Lessee's option shall be extinguished. 

 9.6 Abatement of Rent; Lessee's Remedies . 

 (a) Abatement . In the event of Premises Partial Damage or Premises Total Destruction or a Hazardous Substance Condition for which Lessee is not responsible under this Lease, the Rent payable by Lessee for the period required for the repair, remediation or restoration of such damage shall be abated in proportion to the degree to which Lessee's use of the Premises is impaired, but not to exceed the proceeds received from the Rental Value insurance. All other obligations of Lessee hereunder shall be performed by Lessee, and Lessor shall have no liability for any such damage, destruction, remediation, repair or restoration except as provided herein. 

 (b) Remedies . If Lessor is obligated to repair or restore the Premises and does not commence, in a substantial and meaningful way, such repair or restoration within 90 days after such obligation shall accrue, Lessee may, at any time prior to the commencement of such repair or restoration, give written notice to Lessor and to any Lenders of which Lessee has actual notice, of Lessee's election to terminate this Lease on a date not less than 60 days following the giving of such notice. If Lessee gives such notice and such repair or restoration is not commenced within 30 days thereafter, this Lease shall terminate as of the date specified in said notice. If the repair or restoration is commenced within such 30 days, this Lease shall continue in full force and effect. "Commence" shall mean either the unconditional authorization of the preparation of the required plans, or the beginning of the actual work on the Premises, whichever first occurs. 

 9.7 Termination; Advance Payments . Upon termination of this Lease pursuant to Paragraph 6.2(g) or Paragraph 9, an equitable adjustment shall be made concerning advance Base Rent and any other advance payments made by Lessee to Lessor. Lessor shall, in addition, return to Lessee so much of Lessee's Security Deposit as has not been, or is not then required to be, used by Lessor. 

10. 

Real Property Taxes. 

10.1 Definitions . 

 (a) " Real Property Taxes ." As used herein, the term " Real Property Taxes " shall include any form of assessment; real estate, general, special, ordinary or extraordinary, or rental levy or tax (other than inheritance, personal income or estate taxes); improvement bond; and/or license fee imposed upon or levied against any legal or equitable interest of Lessor in the Project, Lessor's right to other income therefrom, and/or Lessor's business of leasing, by any authority having the direct or indirect power to tax and where the funds are generated with reference to the Project address. The term "Real Property Taxes" shall also include any tax, fee, levy, assessment or charge, or any increase therein: (i) imposed by reason of events occurring during the term of this Lease, including but not limited to, a change in the ownership of the Project; (ii) a change in the improvements thereon; and/or (iii) levied or assessed on machinery or equipment provided by Lessor to Lessee pursuant to this Lease. 

9 of 18

(b) " Base Real Property Taxes ." As used herein, the term " Base Real Property Taxes " shall be the amount of Real Property Taxes, which are assessed against the Project, during the entire calendar year in which the Lease is executed. 

 10.2 Payment of Taxes . Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 10.3, Lessor shall pay the Real Property Taxes applicable to the Project, and said payments shall be included in the calculation of Common Area Operating Expenses in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 4.2. 

 10.3 Additional Improvements . Common Area Operating Expenses shall not include Real Property Taxes specified in the tax assessor's records and work sheets as being caused by additional improvements placed upon the Project by other tenants or by Lessor for the exclusive enjoyment of such other Tenants. Notwithstanding Paragraph 10.2 hereof, Lessee shall, however, pay to Lessor at the time Common Area Operating Expenses are payable under Paragraph 4.2, the entirety of any increase in Real Property Taxes if assessed solely by reason of Alterations, Trade Fixtures or Utility Installations placed upon the Premises by Lessee or at Lessee's request or by reason of any alterations or improvements to the Premises made by Lessor subsequent to the execution of this Lease by the Parties. 

 10.4 Joint Assessment . If the Building is not separately assessed, Real Property Taxes allocated to the Building shall be an equitable proportion of the Real Property Taxes for all of the land and improvements included within the tax parcel assessed, such proportion to be determined by Lessor from the respective valuations assigned in the assessor's work sheets or such other information as may be reasonably available. Lessor's reasonable determination thereof, in good faith, shall be conclusive. 

 10.5 Personal Property Taxes . Lessee shall pay prior to delinquency all taxes assessed against and levied upon Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations, Trade Fixtures, furnishings, equipment and all personal property of Lessee contained in the Premises. When possible, Lessee shall cause its Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations, Trade Fixtures, furnishings, equipment and all other personal property to be assessed and billed separately from the real property of Lessor. If any of Lessee's said property shall be assessed with Lessor's real property, Lessee shall pay Lessor the taxes attributable to Lessee's property within 10 days after receipt of a written statement setting forth the taxes applicable to Lessee's property. 

11. 

Utilities and Services. 

11.1 Lessee shall pay for all water, gas, heat, light, power, telephone, trash disposal and other utilities and services supplied to the Premises, together with any taxes thereon. Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph 4.2, if at any time in Lessor's sole judgment, Lessor determines that Lessee is using a disproportionate amount of water, electricity or other commonly metered utilities, or that Lessee is generating such a large volume of trash as to require an increase in the size of the trash receptacle and/or an increase in the number of times per month that it is emptied, then Lessor may increase Lessee's Base Rent by an amount equal to such increased costs. There shall be no abatement of Rent and Lessor shall not be liable in any respect whatsoever for the inadequacy, stoppage, interruption or discontinuance of any utility or service due to riot, strike, labor dispute, breakdown, accident, repair or other cause beyond Lessor's reasonable control or in cooperation with governmental request or directions. 

 11.2 Within fifteen days of Lessor's written request, Lessee agrees to deliver to Lessor such information, documents and/or authorization as Lessor needs in order for Lessor to comply with new or existing Applicable Requirements relating to commercial building energy usage, ratings, and/or the reporting thereof.

13. Default; Breach; Remedies. 

 13.1 Default; Breach . A " Default " is defined as a failure by the Lessee to comply with or perform any of the terms, covenants, conditions or Rules and Regulations under this Lease. A " Breach " is defined as the occurrence of one or more of the following Defaults, and the failure of Lessee to cure such Default within any applicable grace period: 

 (a) The abandonment of the Premises; the vacating of the Premises prior to the expiration or termination of this Lease without providing a commercially reasonable level of security, or where the coverage of the property insurance described in Paragraph 8.3 is jeopardized as a result thereof, or without providing reasonable assurances to minimize potential vandalism; or failure to deliver to Lessor exclusive possession of the entire Premises in accordance herewith prior to the expiration or termination of this Lease. 

 (b) The failure of Lessee to make any payment of Rent or any Security Deposit required to be made by Lessee hereunder, whether to Lessor or to a third party, when due, to provide reasonable evidence of insurance or surety bond, or to fulfill any obligation under this Lease which endangers or threatens life or property, where such failure continues for a period of 3 business days following written notice to Lessee. THE ACCEPTANCE BY LESSOR OF A PARTIAL PAYMENT OF RENT OR SECURITY DEPOSIT SHALL NOT CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF ANY OF LESSOR'S RIGHTS, INCLUDING LESSOR'S RIGHT TO RECOVER POSSESSION OF THE PREMISES. 

 (c) The failure of Lessee to allow Lessor and/or its agents access to the Premises or the commission of waste, act or acts constituting public or private nuisance, and/or an illegal activity on the Premises by Lessee, where such actions continue for a period of 3 business days following written notice to Lessee. In the event that Lessee commits waste, a nuisance or an illegal activity a second time then, the Lessor may elect to treat such conduct as a non-curable Breach rather than a Default. 

 (d) The failure by Lessee to provide (i) reasonable written evidence of compliance with Applicable Requirements, (ii) the service contracts, (iii) the rescission of an unauthorized assignment or subletting, (iv) an Estoppel Certificate or financial statements, (v) a requested subordination, (vi) evidence concerning any guaranty and/or Guarantor, (vii) any document requested under Paragraph 41, (viii) material safety data sheets (MSDS), or (ix) any other documentation or information which Lessor may reasonably require of Lessee under the terms of this Lease, where any such failure continues for a period of 10 days following written notice to Lessee. 

 (e) A Default by Lessee as to the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of this Lease, or of the rules adopted under Paragraph 2.9 hereof, other than those described in subparagraphs 13.1(a), (b), (c) or (d), above, where such Default continues for a period of 30 days after written notice; provided, however, that if the nature of Lessee's Default is such that more than 30 days are reasonably required for its cure, then it shall not be deemed to be a Breach if Lessee commences such cure within said 30 day period and thereafter diligently prosecutes such cure to completion. 

 (f) The occurrence of any of the following events: (i) the making of any general arrangement or assignment for the benefit of creditors; (ii) becoming a " debtor " as defined in 11 U.S.C. 101 or any successor statute thereto (unless, in the case of a petition filed against Lessee, the same is dismissed within 60 days); (iii) the appointment of a trustee or receiver to take possession of substantially all of Lessee's assets located at the Premises or of Lessee's interest in this Lease, where possession is not restored to Lessee within 30 days; or (iv) the attachment, execution or other judicial seizure of substantially all of Lessee's assets located at the Premises or of Lessee's interest in this Lease, where such seizure is not discharged within 30 days; provided, however, in the event that any provision of this subparagraph is contrary to any applicable law, such provision shall be of no force or effect, and not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. 

(g) 

The discovery that any financial statement of Lessee or of any Guarantor given to Lessor was materially false. 

(h) If the performance of Lessee's obligations under this Lease is guaranteed: (i) the death of a Guarantor, (ii) the termination of a Guarantor's liability with respect to this Lease other than in accordance with the terms of such guaranty, (iii) a Guarantor's becoming insolvent or the subject of a bankruptcy filing, (iv) a Guarantor's refusal to honor the guaranty, or (v) a Guarantor's breach of its guaranty obligation on an anticipatory basis, and Lessee's failure, within 60 days following written notice of any such event, to provide written alternative assurance or security, which, when coupled with the then existing resources of Lessee, equals or exceeds the combined financial resources of Lessee and the Guarantors that existed at the time of execution of this Lease. 

 13.2 Remedies . If Lessee fails to perform any of its affirmative duties or obligations, within 10 days after written notice (or in case of an emergency, without notice), Lessor may, at its option, perform such duty or obligation on Lessee's behalf, including but not limited to the obtaining of reasonably required bonds, insurance policies, or governmental licenses, permits or approvals. Lessee shall pay to Lessor an amount equal to 115 of the costs and expenses incurred by Lessor in such performance upon receipt of an invoice therefor. In the event of a Breach, Lessor may, with or without further notice or demand, and without limiting Lessor in the exercise of any right or remedy which Lessor may have by reason of such Breach: 

 (a) Terminate Lessee's right to possession of the Premises by any lawful means, in which case this Lease shall terminate and Lessee shall immediately 

11 of 18

surrender possession to Lessor. In such event Lessor shall be entitled to recover from Lessee: (i) the unpaid Rent which had been earned at the time of termination; (i) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that the Lessee proves could have been reasonably avoided; (iii) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent for the balance of the term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that the Lessee proves could be reasonably avoided; and (iv) any other amount necessary to compensate Lessor for all the detriment proximately caused by the Lessee's failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom, including but not limited to the cost of recovering possession of the Premises, expenses of reletting, including necessary renovation and alteration of the Premises, reasonable attorneys' fees, and that portion of any leasing commission paid by Lessor in connection with this Lease applicable to the unexpired term of this Lease. The worth at the time of award of the amount referred to in provision (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of the District within which the Premises are located at the time of award plus one percent. Efforts by Lessor to mitigate damages caused by Lessee's Breach of this Lease shall not waive Lessor's right to recover any damages to which Lessor is otherwise entitled. If termination of this Lease is obtained through the provisional remedy of unlawful detainer, Lessor shall have the right to recover in such proceeding any unpaid Rent and damages as are recoverable therein, or Lessor may reserve the right to recover all or any part thereof in a separate suit. If a notice and grace period required under Paragraph 13.1 was not previously given, a notice to pay rent or quit, or to perform or quit given to Lessee under the unlawful detainer statute shall also constitute the notice required by Paragraph 13.1. In such case, the applicable grace period required by Paragraph 13.1 and the unlawful detainer statute shall run concurrently, and the failure of Lessee to cure the Default within the greater of the two such grace periods shall constitute both an unlawful detainer and a Breach of this Lease entitling Lessor to the remedies provided for in this Lease and/or by said statute. 

 (b) Continue the Lease and Lessee's right to possession and recover the Rent as it becomes due, in which event Lessee may sublet or assign, subject only to reasonable limitations. Acts of maintenance, efforts to relet, and/or the appointment of a receiver to protect the Lessor's interests, shall not constitute a termination of the Lessee's right to possession. 

 (c) Pursue any other remedy now or hereafter available under the laws or judicial decisions of the state wherein the Premises are located. The expiration or termination of this Lease and/or the termination of Lessee's right to possession shall not relieve Lessee from liability under any indemnity provisions of this Lease as to matters occurring or accruing during the term hereof or by reason of Lessee's occupancy of the Premises. 

 13.3 Inducement Recapture. Any agreement for free or abated rent or other charges, the cost of tenant improvements for Lessee paid for or performed by Lessor, or for the giving or paying by Lessor to or for Lessee of any cash or other bonus, inducement or consideration for Lessee's entering into this Lease, all of which concessions are hereinafter referred to as " Inducement Provisions ," shall be deemed conditioned upon Lessee's full and faithful performance of all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease. Upon Breach of this Lease by Lessee, any such Inducement Provision shall automatically be deemed deleted from this Lease and of no further force or effect, and any rent, other charge, bonus, inducement or consideration theretofore abated, given or paid by Lessor under such an Inducement Provision shall be immediately due and payable by Lessee to Lessor, notwithstanding any subsequent cure of said Breach by Lessee. The acceptance by Lessor of rent or the cure of the Breach which initiated the operation of this paragraph shall not be deemed a waiver by Lessor of the provisions of this paragraph unless specifically so stated in writing by Lessor at the time of such acceptance. 

 13.4 Late Charges . Lessee hereby acknowledges that late payment by Lessee of Rent will cause Lessor to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of which will be extremely difficult to ascertain. Such costs include, but are not limited to, processing and accounting charges, and late charges which may be imposed upon Lessor by any Lender. Accordingly, if any Rent shall not be received by Lessor within 5 days after such amount shall be due, then, without any requirement for notice to Lessee, Lessee shall immediately pay to Lessor a one-time late charge equal to 10 of each such overdue amount or 100, whichever is greater. The parties hereby agree that such late charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs Lessor will incur by reason of such late payment. Acceptance of such late charge by Lessor shall in no event constitute a waiver of Lessee's Default or Breach with respect to such overdue amount, nor prevent the exercise of any of the other rights and remedies granted hereunder. In the event that a late charge is payable hereunder, whether or not collected, for 3 consecutive installments of Base Rent, then notwithstanding any provision of this Lease to the contrary, Base Rent shall, at Lessor's option, become due and payable quarterly in advance. 

 13.5 Interest . Any monetary payment due Lessor hereunder, other than late charges, not received by Lessor, when due shall bear interest from the 31st day after it was due. The interest (" Interest ") charged shall be computed at the rate of 10 per annum but shall not exceed the maximum rate allowed by law. Interest is payable in addition to the potential late charge provided for in Paragraph 13.4. 

 13.6 Breach by Lessor . 

 (a) Notice of Breach . Lessor shall not be deemed in breach of this Lease unless Lessor fails within a reasonable time to perform an obligation required to be performed by Lessor. For purposes of this Paragraph, a reasonable time shall in no event be less than 30 days after receipt by Lessor, and any Lender whose name and address shall have been furnished to Lessee in writing for such purpose, of written notice specifying wherein such obligation of Lessor has not been performed; provided, however, that if the nature of Lessor's obligation is such that more than 30 days are reasonably required for its performance, then Lessor shall not be in breach if performance is commenced within such 30 day period and thereafter diligently pursued to completion. 

 (b) Performance by Lessee on Behalf of Lessor . In the event that neither Lessor nor Lender cures said breach within 30 days after receipt of said notice, or if having commenced said cure they do not diligently pursue it to completion, then Lessee may elect to cure said breach at Lessee's expense and offset from Rent the actual and reasonable cost to perform such cure, provided however, that such offset shall not exceed an amount equal to the greater of one month's Base Rent or the Security Deposit, reserving Lessee's right to reimbursement from Lessor for any such expense in excess of such offset. Lessee shall document the cost of said cure and supply said documentation to Lessor. 

14. Condemnation . If the Premises or any portion thereof are taken under the power of eminent domain or sold under the threat of the exercise of said power (collectively " Condemnation "), this Lease shall terminate as to the part taken as of the date the condemning authority takes title or possession, whichever first occurs. If more than 10 of the floor area of the Unit, or more than 25 of the parking spaces is taken by Condemnation, Lessee may, at Lessee's option, to be exercised in writing within 10 days after Lessor shall have given Lessee written notice of such taking (or in the absence of such notice, within 10 days after the condemning authority shall have taken possession) terminate this Lease as of the date the condemning authority takes such possession. If Lessee does not terminate this Lease in accordance with the foregoing, this Lease shall remain in full force and effect as to the portion of the Premises remaining, except that the Base Rent shall be reduced in proportion to the reduction in utility of the Premises caused by such Condemnation. Condemnation awards and/or payments shall be the property of Lessor, whether such award shall be made as compensation for diminution in value of the leasehold, the value of the part taken, or for severance damages; provided, however, that Lessee shall be entitled to any compensation paid by the condemnor for Lessee's relocation expenses, loss of business goodwill and/or Trade Fixtures, without regard to whether or not this Lease is terminated pursuant to the provisions of this Paragraph. All Alterations and Utility Installations made to the Premises by Lessee, for purposes of Condemnation only, shall be considered the property of the Lessee and Lessee shall be entitled to any and all compensation which is payable therefor. In the event that this Lease is not terminated by reason of the Condemnation, Lessor shall repair any damage to the Premises caused by such Condemnation.

15. 

Brokerage Fees. 

15.3 Representations and Indemnities of Broker Relationships. Lessee and Lessor each represent and warrant to the other that it has had no dealings with any person, firm, broker, agent or finder (other than the Brokers and Agents, if any) in connection with this Lease, and that no one other than said named Brokers and Agents is entitled to any commission or finder's fee in connection herewith. Lessee and Lessor do each hereby agree to indemnify, protect, defend and hold the other harmless from and against liability for compensation or charges which may be claimed by any such unnamed broker, finder or other similar party by reason of any dealings or actions of the indemnifying Party, including any costs, expenses, attorneys' fees reasonably incurred with respect thereto. 

16. 

Estoppel Certificates. 

(a) Each Party (as " Responding Party ") shall within 10 days after written notice from the other Party (the " Requesting Party ") execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Requesting Party a statement in writing in form similar to the then most current " Estoppel Certificate " form published BY AIR CRE, plus such additional information, confirmation and/or statements as may be reasonably requested by the Requesting Party. 

 (b) If the Responding Party shall fail to execute or deliver the Estoppel Certificate within such 10 day period, the Requesting Party may execute an Estoppel Certificate stating that: (i) the Lease is in full force and effect without modification except as may be represented by the Requesting Party, (ii) there are no uncured defaults in the Requesting Party's performance, and (iii) if Lessor is the Requesting Party, not more than one month's rent has been paid in advance. Prospective purchasers and encumbrancers may rely upon the Requesting Party's Estoppel Certificate, and the Responding Party shall be estopped from denying the truth of the facts contained in said Certificate. In addition, Lessee acknowledges that any failure on its part to provide such an Estoppel Certificate will expose Lessor to risks and potentially cause Lessor to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the extent of which will be extremely difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, should the Lessee fail to execute and/or deliver a requested Estoppel Certificate in a timely fashion the monthly Base Rent shall be automatically increased, without any requirement for notice to Lessee, by an amount equal to 10 of the then existing Base Rent or 100, whichever is greater for remainder of the Lease. The Parties agree that such increase in Base Rent represents fair and reasonable compensation for the additional risk/costs that Lessor will incur by reason of Lessee's failure to provide the Estoppel Certificate. Such increase in Base Rent shall in no event constitute a waiver of Lessee's Default or Breach with respect to the failure to provide the Estoppel Certificate nor prevent the exercise of any of the other rights and remedies granted hereunder. 

(c) 

If Lessor desires to finance, refinance, or sell the Premises, or any part thereof, Lessee and all Guarantors shall within 10 days after written notice 

from Lessor deliver to any potential lender or purchaser designated by Lessor such financial statements as may be reasonably required by such lender or purchaser, including but not limited to Lessee's financial statements for the past 3 years. All such financial statements shall be received by Lessor and such lender or purchaser in confidence and shall be used only for the purposes herein set forth. 

17. Definition of Lessor. The term " Lessor " as used herein shall mean the owner or owners at the time in question of the fee title to the Premises, or, if this is a sublease, of the Lessee's interest in the prior lease. In the event of a transfer of Lessor's title or interest in the Premises or this Lease, Lessor shall deliver to the transferee or assignee (in cash or by credit) any unused Security Deposit held by Lessor. Upon such transfer or assignment and delivery of the Security Deposit, as aforesaid, the prior Lessor shall be relieved of all liability with respect to the obligations and/or covenants under this Lease thereafter to be performed by the Lessor. Subject to the foregoing, the obligations and/or covenants in this Lease to be performed by the Lessor shall be binding only upon the Lessor as hereinabove defined. 

18. Severability. The invalidity of any provision of this Lease, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, shall in no way affect the validity of any other provision hereof. 

19. 

Days. Unless otherwise specifically indicated to the contrary, the word " days " as used in this Lease shall mean and refer to calendar days. 

20. Limitation on Liability. The obligations of Lessor under this Lease shall not constitute personal obligations of Lessor, or its partners, members, directors, officers or shareholders, and Lessee shall look to the Premises, and to no other assets of Lessor, for the satisfaction of any liability of Lessor with respect to this Lease, and shall not seek recourse against Lessor's partners, members, directors, officers or shareholders, or any of their personal assets for such satisfaction. 

21. 

Time of Essence. Time is of the essence with respect to the performance of all obligations to be performed or observed by the Parties under this Lease. 

22. No Prior or Other Agreements; Broker Disclaimer . This Lease contains all agreements between the Parties with respect to any matter mentioned herein, and no other prior or contemporaneous agreement or understanding shall be effective. Lessor and Lessee each represents and warrants to the Brokers that it has made, and is relying solely upon, its own investigation as to the nature, quality, character and financial responsibility of the other Party to this Lease and as to the use, nature, quality and character of the Premises. Brokers have no responsibility with respect thereto or with respect to any default or breach hereof by either Party. 

23. 

Notices. 

23.1 Notice Requirements . All notices required or permitted by this Lease or applicable law shall be in writing and may be delivered in person (by hand or by courier) or may be sent by regular, certified or registered mail or U.S. Postal Service Express Mail, with postage prepaid, or by facsimile transmission, or by email, and shall be deemed sufficiently given if served in a manner specified in this Paragraph 23. The addresses noted adjacent to a Party's signature on this Lease shall be that Party's address for delivery or mailing of notices. Either Party may by written notice to the other specify a different address for notice, except that upon Lessee's taking possession of the Premises, the Premises shall constitute Lessee's address for notice. A copy of all notices to Lessor shall be concurrently transmitted to such party or parties at such addresses as Lessor may from time to time hereafter designate in writing. 

 23.2 Date of Notice . Any notice sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, shall be deemed given on the date of delivery shown on the receipt card, or if no delivery date is shown, the postmark thereon. If sent by regular mail the notice shall be deemed given 72 hours after the same is addressed as required herein and mailed with postage prepaid. Notices delivered by United States Express Mail or overnight courier that guarantees next day delivery shall be 

13 of 18

deemed given 24 hours after delivery of the same to the Postal Service or courier. Notices delivered by hand, or transmitted by facsimile transmission or by email shall be deemed delivered upon actual receipt. If notice is received on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, it shall be deemed received on the next business day. 

 23.3 Options. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to exercise any Options (see paragraph 39), the Notice must be sent by Certified Mail (return receipt requested), Express Mail (signature required), courier (signature required) or some other methodology that provides a receipt establishing the date the notice was received by the Lessor. 

24. 

Waivers. 

(a) No waiver by Lessor of the Default or Breach of any term, covenant or condition hereof by Lessee, shall be deemed a waiver of any other term, covenant or condition hereof, or of any subsequent Default or Breach by Lessee of the same or of any other term, covenant or condition hereof. Lessor's consent to, or approval of, any act shall not be deemed to render unnecessary the obtaining of Lessor's consent to, or approval of, any subsequent or similar act by Lessee, or be construed as the basis of an estoppel to enforce the provision or provisions of this Lease requiring such consent. 

 (b) The acceptance of Rent by Lessor shall not be a waiver of any Default or Breach by Lessee. Any payment by Lessee may be accepted by Lessor on account of monies or damages due Lessor, notwithstanding any qualifying statements or conditions made by Lessee in connection therewith, which such statements and/or conditions shall be of no force or effect whatsoever unless specifically agreed to in writing by Lessor at or before the time of deposit of such payment. 

 (c) THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE TERMS OF THIS LEASE SHALL GOVERN WITH REGARD TO ALL MATTERS RELATED THERETO AND HEREBY WAIVE THE PROVISIONS OF ANY PRESENT OR FUTURE STATUTE TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH STATUTE IS INCONSISTENT WITH THIS LEASE. 

25. 

Disclosures Regarding The Nature of a Real Estate Agency Relationship. 

(a) When entering into a discussion with a real estate agent regarding a real estate transaction, a Lessor or Lessee should from the outset understand what type of agency relationship or representation it has with the agent or agents in the transaction. Lessor and Lessee acknowledge being advised by the Brokers in this transaction, as follows: 

 (i) Lessor's Agent . A Lessor's agent under a listing agreement with the Lessor acts as the agent for the Lessor only. A Lessor's agent or subagent has the following affirmative obligations: To the Lessor : A fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty, and loyalty in dealings with the Lessor. To the Lessee and the Lessor : (a) Diligent exercise of reasonable skills and care in performance of the agent's duties. (b) A duty of honest and fair dealing and good faith. (c) A duty to disclose all facts known to the agent materially affecting the value or desirability of the property that are not known to, or within the diligent attention and observation of, the Parties. An agent is not obligated to reveal to either Party any confidential information obtained from the other Party which does not involve the affirmative duties set forth above. 

 (ii) Lessee's Agent . An agent can agree to act as agent for the Lessee only. In these situations, the agent is not the Lessor's agent, even if by agreement the agent may receive compensation for services rendered, either in full or in part from the Lessor. An agent acting only for a Lessee has the following affirmative obligations. To the Lessee : A fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty, and loyalty in dealings with the Lessee. To the Lessee and the Lesso r : (a) Diligent exercise of reasonable skills and care in performance of the agent's duties. (b) A duty of honest and fair dealing and good faith. (c) A duty to disclose all facts known to the agent materially affecting the value or desirability of the property that are not known to, or within the diligent attention and observation of, the Parties. An agent is not obligated to reveal to either Party any confidential information obtained from the other Party which does not involve the affirmative duties set forth above. 

 (iii) Agent Representing Both Lessor and Lessee . A real estate agent, either acting directly or through one or more associate licenses, can legally be the agent of both the Lessor and the Lessee in a transaction, but only with the knowledge and consent of both the Lessor and the Lessee. In a dual agency situation, the agent has the following affirmative obligations to both the Lessor and the Lessee: (a) A fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty in the dealings with either Lessor or the Lessee. (b) Other duties to the Lessor and the Lessee as stated above in subparagraphs (i) or (ii). In representing both Lessor and Lessee, the agent may not, without the express permission of the respective Party, disclose to the other Party confidential information, including, but not limited to, facts relating to either Lessee's or Lessor's financial position, motivations, bargaining position, or other personal information that may impact rent, including Lessor's willingness to accept a rent less than the listing rent or Lessee's willingness to pay rent greater than the rent offered. The above duties of the agent in a real estate transaction do not relieve a Lessor or Lessee from the responsibility to protect their own interests. Lessor and Lessee should carefully read all agreements to assure that they adequately express their understanding of the transaction. A real estate agent is a person qualified to advise about real estate. If legal or tax advice is desired, consult a competent professional. Both Lessor and Lessee should strongly consider obtaining tax advice from a competent professional because the federal and state tax consequences of a transaction can be complex and subject to change. 

 (b) Brokers have no responsibility with respect to any default or breach hereof by either Party. The Parties agree that no lawsuit or other legal proceeding involving any breach of duty, error or omission relating to this Lease may be brought against Broker more than one year after the Start Date and that the liability (including court costs and attorneys' fees), of any Broker with respect to any such lawsuit and/or legal proceeding shall not exceed the fee received by such Broker pursuant to this Lease; provided, however, that the foregoing limitation on each Broker's liability shall not be applicable to any gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Broker. 

 (c) Lessor and Lessee agree to identify to Brokers as "Confidential" any communication or information given Brokers that is considered by such Party to be confidential. 

26. No Right To Holdover . Lessee has no right to retain possession of the Premises or any part thereof beyond the expiration or termination of this Lease. At or prior to the expiration or termination of this Lease Lessee shall deliver exclusive possession of the Premises to Lessor. For purposes of this provision and Paragraph 13.1(a), exclusive possession shall mean that Lessee shall have vacated the Premises, removed all of its personal property therefrom and that the Premises have been returned in the condition specified in this Lease. In the event that Lessee does not deliver exclusive possession to Lessor as specified above, then Lessor's damages during any holdover period shall be computed at the amount of the Rent (as defined in Paragraph 4.1) due during the last full month before the expiration or termination of this Lease (disregarding any temporary abatement of Rent that may have been in effect), but with Base Rent being 150 of the Base Rent payable during such last full month. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as consent by Lessor to any holding over by Lessee. 

27. Cumulative Remedies. No remedy or election hereunder shall be deemed exclusive but shall, wherever possible, be cumulative with all other remedies at law or in equity. 

28. Covenants and Conditions; Construction of Agreement. All provisions of this Lease to be observed or performed by Lessee are both covenants and conditions. In construing this Lease, all headings and titles are for the convenience of the Parties only and shall not be considered a part of this Lease. Whenever required by the context, the singular shall include the plural and vice versa. This Lease shall not be construed as if prepared by one of the Parties, but rather according to its fair meaning as a whole, as if both Parties had prepared it. 

29. Binding Effect; Choice of Law. This Lease shall be binding upon the Parties, their personal representatives, successors and assigns and be governed by the laws 

14 of 18

of the State in which the Premises are located. Any litigation between the Parties hereto concerning this Lease shall be initiated in the county in which the Premises are located. Signatures to this Lease accomplished by means of electronic signature or similar technology shall be legal and binding. 

30. 

Subordination; Attornment; Non-Disturbance. 

30.1 Subordination . This Lease and any Option granted hereby shall be subject and subordinate to any ground lease, mortgage, deed of trust, or other hypothecation or security device (collectively, " Security Device "), now or hereafter placed upon the Premises, to any and all advances made on the security thereof, and to all renewals, modifications, and extensions thereof. Lessee agrees that the holders of any such Security Devices (in this Lease together referred to as " Lender ") shall have no liability or obligation to perform any of the obligations of Lessor under this Lease. Any Lender may elect to have this Lease and/or any Option granted hereby superior to the lien of its Security Device by giving written notice thereof to Lessee, whereupon this Lease and such Options shall be deemed prior to such Security Device, notwithstanding the relative dates of the documentation or recordation thereof. 

 30.2 Attornment . In the event that Lessor transfers title to the Premises, or the Premises are acquired by another upon the foreclosure or termination of a Security Device to which this Lease is subordinated (i) Lessee shall, subject to the non-disturbance provisions of Paragraph 30.3, attorn to such new owner, and upon request, enter into a new lease, containing all of the terms and provisions of this Lease, with such new owner for the remainder of the term hereof, or, at the election of the new owner, this Lease will automatically become a new lease between Lessee and such new owner, and (ii) Lessor shall thereafter be relieved of any further obligations hereunder and such new owner shall assume all of Lessor's obligations, except that such new owner shall not: (a) be liable for any act or omission of any prior lessor or with respect to events occurring prior to acquisition of ownership; (b) be subject to any offsets or defenses which Lessee might have against any prior lessor, (c) be bound by prepayment of more than one month's rent, or (d) be liable for the return of any security deposit paid to any prior lessor which was not paid or credited to such new owner. 

 30.3 Non-Disturbance . With respect to Security Devices entered into by Lessor after the execution of this Lease, Lessee's subordination of this Lease shall be subject to receiving a commercially reasonable non-disturbance agreement (a " Non-Disturbance Agreement ") from the Lender which Non-Disturbance Agreement provides that Lessee's possession of the Premises, and this Lease, including any options to extend the term hereof, will not be disturbed so long as Lessee is not in Breach hereof and attorns to the record owner of the Premises. Further, within 60 days after the execution of this Lease, Lessor shall, if requested by Lessee, use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a Non-Disturbance Agreement from the holder of any pre-existing Security Device which is secured by the Premises. In the event that Lessor is unable to provide the Non-Disturbance Agreement within said 60 days, then Lessee may, at Lessee's option, directly contact Lender and attempt to negotiate for the execution and delivery of a Non-Disturbance Agreement. 

 30.4 Self-Executing . The agreements contained in this Paragraph 30 shall be effective without the execution of any further documents; provided, however, that, upon written request from Lessor or a Lender in connection with a sale, financing or refinancing of the Premises, Lessee and Lessor shall execute such further writings as may be reasonably required to separately document any subordination, attornment and/or Non-Disturbance Agreement provided for herein. 

31. Attorneys' Fees. If any Party or Broker brings an action or proceeding involving the Premises whether founded in tort, contract or equity, or to declare rights hereunder, the Prevailing Party (as hereafter defined) in any such proceeding, action, or appeal thereon, shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees. Such fees may be awarded in the same suit or recovered in a separate suit, whether or not such action or proceeding is pursued to decision or judgment. The term, " Prevailing Party " shall include, without limitation, a Party or Broker who substantially obtains or defeats the relief sought, as the case may be, whether by compromise, settlement, judgment, or the abandonment by the other Party or Broker of its claim or defense. The attorneys' fees award shall not be computed in accordance with any court fee schedule, but shall be such as to fully reimburse all attorneys' fees reasonably incurred. In addition, Lessor shall be entitled to attorneys' fees, costs and expenses incurred in the preparation and service of notices of Default and consultations in connection therewith, whether or not a legal action is subsequently commenced in connection with such Default or resulting Breach 200 is a reasonable minimum per occurrence for such services and consultation). 

32. Lessor's Access; Showing Premises; Repairs. Lessor and Lessor's agents shall have the right to enter the Premises at any time, in the case of an emergency, and otherwise at reasonable times after reasonable prior notice for the purpose of showing the same to prospective purchasers, lenders, or tenants, and making such alterations, repairs, improvements or additions to the Premises as Lessor may deem necessary or desirable and the erecting, using and maintaining of utilities, services, pipes and conduits through the Premises and/or other premises as long as there is no material adverse effect on Lessee's use of the Premises. All such activities shall be without abatement of rent or liability to Lessee. 

33. Auctions. Lessee shall not conduct, nor permit to be conducted, any auction upon the Premises without Lessor's prior written consent. Lessor shall not be obligated to exercise any standard of reasonableness in determining whether to permit an auction. 

34. Signs. Lessor may place on the Premises ordinary "For Sale" signs at any time and ordinary "For Lease" signs during the last 6 months of the term hereof. Except for ordinary "For Sublease" signs which may be placed only on the Premises, Lessee shall not place any sign upon the Project without Lessor's prior written consent. All signs must comply with all Applicable Requirements. 

35. Termination; Merger. Unless specifically stated otherwise in writing by Lessor, the voluntary or other surrender of this Lease by Lessee, the mutual termination or cancellation hereof, or a termination hereof by Lessor for Breach by Lessee, shall automatically terminate any sublease or lesser estate in the Premises; provided, however, that Lessor may elect to continue any one or all existing subtenancies. Lessor's failure within 10 days following any such event to elect to the contrary by written notice to the holder of any such lesser interest, shall constitute Lessor's election to have such event constitute the termination of such interest. 

36. Consents. All requests for consent shall be in writing. Except as otherwise provided herein, wherever in this Lease the consent of a Party is required to an act by or for the other Party, such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Lessor's actual reasonable costs and expenses (including but not limited to architects', attorneys', engineers' and other consultants' fees) incurred in the consideration of, or response to, a request by Lessee for any Lessor consent, including but not limited to consents to an assignment, a subletting or the presence or use of a Hazardous Substance, shall be paid by Lessee upon receipt of an invoice and supporting documentation therefor. Lessor's consent to any act, assignment or subletting shall not constitute an acknowledgment that no Default or Breach by Lessee of this Lease exists, nor shall such consent be deemed a waiver of any then existing Default or Breach, except as may be otherwise specifically stated in writing by Lessor at the time of such consent. The failure to specify herein any particular condition to Lessor's consent shall not preclude the imposition by Lessor at the time of consent of such further or other conditions as are then reasonable with reference to the particular matter for which consent is being given. In the event that either Party disagrees with any determination made by the other hereunder and reasonably requests the reasons for such determination, the determining party shall furnish its reasons in writing and in reasonable detail within 10 business days following such request.

 39.2 Options Personal To Original Lessee . Any Option granted to Lessee in this Lease is personal to the original Lessee, and cannot be assigned or exercised by anyone other than said original Lessee and only while the original Lessee is in full possession of the Premises and, if requested by Lessor, with Lessee certifying that Lessee has no intention of thereafter assigning or subletting. 

 39.3 Multiple Options . In the event that Lessee has any multiple Options to extend or renew this Lease, a later Option cannot be exercised unless the prior Options have been validly exercised.

 (a) Lessee shall have no right to exercise an Option: (i) during the period commencing with the giving of any notice of Default and continuing until said Default is cured, (ii) during the period of time any Rent is unpaid (without regard to whether notice thereof is given Lessee), (iii) during the time Lessee is in Breach of this Lease, or (iv) in the event that Lessee has been given 3 or more notices of separate Default, whether or not the Defaults are cured, during the 12 month period immediately preceding the exercise of the Option. 

 (b) The period of time within which an Option may be exercised shall not be extended or enlarged by reason of Lessee's inability to exercise an Option because of the provisions of Paragraph 39.4(a). 

 (c) An Option shall terminate and be of no further force or effect, notwithstanding Lessee's due and timely exercise of the Option, if, after such exercise and prior to the commencement of the extended term or completion of the purchase, (i) Lessee fails to pay Rent for a period of 30 days after such Rent becomes due (without any necessity of Lessor to give notice thereof), or (ii) if Lessee commits a Breach of this Lease.

Lessee agrees to sign any documents reasonably requested by Lessor to effectuate such rights. 

42. Performance Under Protest. If at any time a dispute shall arise as to any amount or sum of money to be paid by one Party to the other under the provisions hereof, the Party against whom the obligation to pay the money is asserted shall have the right to make payment "under protest" and such payment shall not be regarded as a voluntary payment and there shall survive the right on the part of said Party to institute suit for recovery of such sum.

45. Offer . Preparation of this Lease by either party or their agent and submission of same to the other Party shall not be deemed an offer to lease to the other Party. This Lease is not intended to be binding until executed and delivered by all Parties hereto. 

46. Amendments. This Lease may be modified only in writing, signed by the Parties in interest at the time of the modification.

Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, Lessor shall not be responsible for the costs and expenses of such modifications or improvements in the event that such improvements or modifications are required as the result of Lessee's use of the Premises or conduct including, but not limited to, Lessee's alterations, improvements or modifications of the Premises. In the event that any alterations, modifications or improvements undertaken by either party pursuant to this Section result in any interruption of the business of Lessee, Lessor shall have no liability to Lessee for such interruption and Lessee shall be limited to such business interruption insurance coverage, if any, as it may elect to carry.

56.3(a) Accessibility Americans with Disabilities Act . Since compliance with the Americans Disabilities Act (ADA) is dependent upon Lessee s specific use of the Premises, Lessor makes no warranty or representation as to whether or not the Premises comply with ADA or any similar legislation.

57.3 Lessor's Option . Within thirty (30) days after Lessor's receipt of Lessee's Request for Transfer, Lessor may, in its sole discretion, exercise any one of the options described below by providing written notice to Lessee of Lessor's election. If for any reason, Lessor fails to give Lessee written notice of Lessor's election as authorized by this subparagraph 53.3 within the said thirty (30) day period, Lessor shall be deemed to have elected to consent to the Transfer. The options available to Lessor are as follows: 

(a) Consent to the requested Transfer (subject in all circumstances to the provisions of subparagraph 55.5, whether or not so expressly stated in the Notice to Lessee setting forth such consent); or 

(b) Withhold consent to the requested Transfer. If Lessor withholds consent, Lessor shall inform Lessee of the reasons therefor. 

57.4 Lessor Entitled to Withhold Consent to Transfer in its Reasonable Discretion . Lessor shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to any Transfer. 

57.5 Consent Given . Should Lessor consent to a Transfer, Lessor may impose upon such Transfer all such reasonable conditions as Lessor may desire, i.e., the following conditions: 

(a) Lessee completing the negotiations for a valid and bona fide Transfer to the Transferee identified in Lessee's Request for Transfer within sixty (60) days after the date of Lessor's consent and such Transfer being in accordance with all the terms and provisions contained in Lessee's Request for Transfer. If for any reason this condition fails, any consent given by Lessor shall be deemed of no force and effect and Lessee shall be required to again comply with all conditions of this Paragraph 53 as if no consent had been given. 

(b) Lessee delivering to Lessor, prior to the earlier of the date the Transfer occurs or the date the Transferee takes possession of the Premises or any part thereof, executed originals of the document of transfer and any other agreement entered into in connection with such Transfer. If the Transfer is by way of assignment, the form of assignment shall expressly state that the Transferee assumes all of Lessee's obligations under this Lease. If the Transfer is by way of sublease, the sublease shall expressly state that: It is subject to the provisions of this Lease; it does not extend beyond the Termination Date; the sublessee's right to transfer its interest in the sublease is subject to Lessor's rights under this Paragraph 53. 

(c) Lessee paying to Lessor as Additional Rent under this Lease, without affecting or reducing any other obligations of Lessee under this Lease, fifty percent (50 of any sums of money or other economic consideration received by Lessee or to be received by Lessee as result of such Transfer (but not any loan proceeds if the Transfer is a bona fide loan), including, but not limited to: Bonuses, key money or the like; any payment made to Lessee by the Transferee, however denominated, which is attributed to either the amortization of the cost of any improvements made to the Premises which were paid by Lessee and are to be used by the Transferee, leasing commissions or any additional Lessee improvements (the installation of which shall at all times be subject to the provisions of this Lease); and, if the Transfer is a subletting, all rentals, whether so denominated or not under the sublease, which exceed in the aggregate sums Lessee is to pay under this Lease. All sums due Lessor pursuant to this subparagraph 53.5(c) shall, provided the Transfer is a subletting, be prorated if the sublease covers less than all of the Premises Area according to the ratio that the Premises area transferred bears to the total Premises area. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessee shall be entitled to deduct from such amounts payable to Lessor pursuant to this Section such reasonable costs and expenses as Lessee actually incurs in obtaining a Transferee, i.e., commissions paid to brokers in connection with such transfer, advertising costs paid by Lessee in connection with such Transfer, the cost of any improvements made by Lessee, of its cost, for the Transferee, and similar items. Lessee shall be obligated, however, to provide evidence to Lessor substantiating such costs and expenses to Lessor's reasonable satisfaction.

The provisions of this Section 53 to the contrary notwithstanding, Lessee shall have the right, without Lessor s consent, to assign or otherwise transfer this Lease, or to sublet the Premises, (i) to any parent or subsidiary of Lessee, and (ii) to any successor to Lessee by way of merger, consolidation, sale of substantially all of Lessee s assets, sale of capital stock or the like; provided that Lessor is notified in writing of the assignment prior to the effective date thereof and the assignee assumes in writing for the direct benefit of Lessor all of Lessee s obligations under this Lease 

57.7 No Release of Liability . No Transfer shall release Lessee of its obligations to pay the Rent and to perform all the other obligations to be performed by Lessee under this Lease. The acceptance of Rent by Lessor from any person shall not be deemed to be the waiver by Lessor of any provision of this Lease or to be a consent to any assignment or subletting. A consent to one Transfer shall not be deemed to be a consent to any subsequent Transfer. In the event of default by a Transferee in the performance of any of the terms of this Lease, Lessor may proceed directly against Lessee without the necessity of exhausting its remedies against the Transferee. If Lessee enters into a sublease, with or without Lessor's consent, Lessee shall be deemed to have immediately and irrevocably assigned to Lessor, as security for Lessee's obligations under this Lease, all subrent or other sums due to Lessee under the sublease, and Lessor, as assignee and as attorney-in-fact for Lessee, or a receiver for Lessee appointed on Lessor's application, may collect such subrent or other sums due and apply it towards Lessee's obligations under this Lease, except, that, until the occurrence of an act of default by Lessee, Lessee shall have the right to collect such subrent or other sums due. Lessor may, as a condition to Lessor's consent to any proposed sublease, require Lessee and the proposed sublessee to enter into an agreement with Lessor whereby the proposed sublessee agrees: To pay subrent or all other sums due directly to Lessor upon notice from Lessor of Lessee's default; not to pay subrent more than one month in advance, and, notwithstanding Lessor's receipt of subrent or other sums due, Lessor shall not be liable to the proposed sublessee for anything under the sublease or under this Lease and Lessor may pursue any remedy available to it under this Lease. 

58. CONFIDENTIALITY NO RECORDATION . Lessee and Lessee s employees, agents, representatives, and brokers agree to keep the terms of this Lease, and all communications related thereto, strictly confidential, and shall not disclose, directly or indirectly, such terms to any person or party without first obtaining the prior written consent of Lessor; provided, however, that such consent shall not be required for any disclosure to the extent reasonably required (i) when required by applicable laws, regulations or court orders, or in compliance with any of the same (and Lessee shall provide Lessor with notice thereof prior to such disclosure, to the extent permitted by law, in order to enable Lessor to seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy or otherwise further protect such confidential information), or (ii) in connection with any action by Lessee pursuant to which Lessee is enforcing its rights or remedies under this Lease. Without limitation to the foregoing, Lessee agrees not to record this Lease or any memorandum thereof; however, Lessor may record this Lease or a memorandum thereof, at its sole election, and Lessee agrees to execute such memorandum upon request by Lessor. 

59. FORCE MAJEURE . If either Lessor or Lessee cannot perform any of its obligations (other than and specifically excluding, for the purpose of this Section 57, Lessee's obligation to pay Base Rent or Additional Rent hereunder) due to events beyond such party's control, the time provided for performing such obligations shall be extended by a period of time equal to the duration of such events. Events beyond a party's control include, but are not limited to, acts of God, war, civil commotion, labor disputes, strikes, fire, flood or other casualty, shortages of labor or material, government regulation or restriction and weather conditions. 

60. INDEMNIFICATION, WAIVER AND RELEASE . Except for any injury to persons or damage to property that is caused by or results from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Lessor, its employees, or agents, Lessee shall indemnify and hold Lessor, Lessor s wholly owned subsidiaries and the employees and agents of Lessor and Lessor s wholly owned subsidiaries, including without limitation Lessor s property manager (hereinafter collectively referred to as the Indemnified Parties and individually as an Indemnified Party harmless from and against any and all demands, claims, causes of action, fines, penalties, damages, liabilities, judgments, and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys fees) incurred in connection with or arising from:

Lessor agrees that it will keep such financial statements confidential, except that Lessor shall have the right to deliver the same to any proposed purchaser of the Premises, or any portion thereof and to the mortgagees or beneficiaries of Lessor or such purchaser, provided that such parties agree in writing to keep such statements confidential. 

62. CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1938 STATEMENT Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1938, Lessor states that to the best of its knowledge as of the date of execution of this Lease, the property being leased pursuant hereto has not undergone an inspection by a Certified Access Specialist (CASp). Lessor makes no representations, express or implied, as to the compliance of the Premises or the building in which the Premises are located with applicable construction related accessibility standard. A Certified Access Specialist (CASp) can inspect the Premises and determine whether the Premises comply with all of the applicable construction-related accessibility standards under state law. Although state law does not require a CASp inspection of the Premises, the commercial property owner or lessor may not prohibit the lessee or lessee from obtaining a CAS- inspection of the Premises for the occupancy or potential occupancy of the lessee or lessee, if requested by the lessee or lessee.

WHEREAS, as a material inducement to and in consideration of Lessor executing the Lease, Lessor requires Mike Qingkun Wang (" Guarantor ") to execute this Guaranty of Lease (" Guaranty "); Guarantor desires Lessee to consummate the Lease. Accordingly, contemporaneous with execution of the Lease, Guarantor is executing this Guaranty to induce Lessor to execute the Lease with Lessee. 

NOW THEREFORE, Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees and promises to perform and be liable for any and all obligations and liabilities of Lessee under the Lease, including, but not limited to, payment of all rents and all other sums payable by Lessee under the Lease and performance by Lessee of each and every one of the terms, conditions and covenants to be kept and performed by Lessee under the Lease. 

Guarantor hereby agrees that, without the consent of, or notice to, Guarantor and without affecting or in any way releasing Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty: (i) Lessor and Lessee may, by agreement or course of conduct, amend, extend, renew or otherwise alter any term, covenant or condition of the Lease, or the Lease may be assigned by Lessor or Lessee (and their successors and assigns) and this Guaranty shall guarantee all obligations of Lessee under the Lease as so amended, extended, renewed, altered or assigned; (ii) Lessor may release, change or add a party to the Lease and/or a guarantor of the Lease; (iii) Lessor may exercise, not exercise, delay exercising, impair, modify, limit, terminate or suspend any of Lessor's rights or remedies under the Lease or this Guaranty; and (iv) Lessor may permit all or any part of the Premises to be subleased, or the Lease to be assigned, assumed, transferred, mortgaged or encumbered. 

Guarantor hereby agrees that no notice of nonperformance or default by Lessee or by another guarantor need be given to Guarantor. This Guaranty is a continuing and irrevocable guarantee. Guarantor waives the benefit of any law allowing Guarantor to revoke this Guaranty. No provision of this Guaranty or rights of Lessor hereunder may be waived, nor may any Guarantor be released from any obligation under this Guaranty except by a writing duly executed by Lessor. 

Guarantor hereby waives and agrees not to assert or take advantage of any right or defense based on: (i) notice of acceptance of this Guaranty; (ii) demands (including demands for payment or performance), presentation and protest; (iii) any statute of limitations; (iv) requiring Lessor to proceed against Lessee, any Guarantor or other guarantor or any other person (as herein defined) liable to Lessor, or to proceed against these persons in any order; (v) requiring Lessor to apply any security deposit or other security; (vi) requiring Lessor to proceed under any other remedy Lessor may have before proceeding against Guarantor; (vii) any right of subrogation that Guarantor may have against Lessee or other guarantors; (viii) any right or defense that may arise by reason of the incapacity, lack of authority, death or disability of Lessee, any guarantor or any other person; (ix) any right or defense arising by reason of the absence, impairment, modification, limitation, destruction or cessation (in bankruptcy, by an election of remedies, or otherwise) of the liability of Lessee, of the subrogation rights of Guarantor, or of the rights of Guarantor to proceed against Lessee for reimbursement; (x) limiting Guarantor's obligations to not exceed Lessee's obligations; and (xi) notices (including notices of adverse change in the financial status of Lessee or other facts that increase the risk to Guarantor). 

The obligations of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall not be altered, limited or affected by any proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, involving the bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization or liquidation of Lessee, Guarantor, any other guarantor, or by any defense that Lessee, Guarantor or any other guarantor may have by reason of any order, decree, or decision of any court or administrative body resulting from any such proceeding. 

Guarantor subordinates any and all existing or future indebtedness of Lessee to Guarantor to Lessee's obligations owed to Lessor under the Lease. Any recovery by Lessor from any other guarantor or insurer shall first be credited to the portion of Lessee's indebtedness to Lessor which exceeds the maximum liability of Guarantor under this Guaranty. If a person comprising Guarantor is married, such Guarantor expressly agrees that recourse may be had against such Guarantor's separate or community property. 

Guarantor shall, upon ten (10) days' prior written notice from Lessor, provide Lessor with Guarantor's financial statements for the current year and tax returns for the three (3) preceding years and, if such is the normal practice of Guarantor, such statements shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting 

 principles and audited by an independent certified public accountant. Lessor shall maintain Guarantor's financial statements and tax returns in confidence but shall be 

permitted to disclose Guarantor's financial statements and tax returns to prospective lenders, purchasers or others for a bona fide business purpose. 

Guarantor shall, upon ten (10) days' prior written notice from Lessor, in writing reaffirm that this Guaranty remains and continues in full force and effect, that no event has occurred that would invalidate the Guaranty or excuse Guarantor's obligations or performance under the Guaranty, and that the Guaranty applies to the Lease, as amended, extended, renewed, altered or assigned. Guarantor shall, upon ten (10) days' prior written notice from Lessor, execute such other and further documents and do such further acts as may be reasonably necessary or required by Lessor to effectuate the intent of the parties and carry out the terms of this Guaranty. 

Guarantor agrees that any suit, action or proceeding arising directly or indirectly from the Guaranty or the Lease shall be litigated only in courts located within the county and state in which the Premises is located. Guarantor irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of any local, state or federal court located within the county and state in which the Premises is located, and waives and agrees not to assert by way of motion, defense or otherwise in any suit, action, or proceeding any claim that Guarantor is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that such suit, action, or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, or that the venue of such action, suit, or proceeding is improper. 

Each person which comprises Guarantor consents to service of process by a nationally recognized overnight courier service (such as Federal Express) at either the Premises or at the Guarantor's address for notices set forth below, and shall be deemed served and received three (3) business days after deposit with the overnight mail service. Guarantor irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any action or proceeding that such service of process was in any way invalid 

Page 1 of 2

or ineffective. Lessor reserves the right to serve process in any other manner permitted by law. 

This Guaranty shall be governed by the laws of the state in which the Premises is located and, for purposes of conflicts of law, Guarantor shall be treated as if resident of or domiciled in such state. Guarantor waives the right to a jury trial of any cause of action, claim, counterclaim or cross-complaint in any action, proceeding or other hearing brought against Guarantor. If and to the extent the Lease requires Lessor and Lessee to arbitrate any disputes, then Guarantor also agrees to arbitrate such disputes in the same arbitration to the extent related to the Guaranty and upon the same terms and conditions provided in the Lease. 

If Lessor brings an action or proceeding against Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty, the Prevailing Party (as hereafter defined) in any such proceeding, action, or appeal thereon, shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees. Such fees may be awarded in the same suit or recovered in a separate suit, whether or not such action or proceeding is pursued to decision or judgment. The term, "Prevailing Party" shall include, without limitation, the party who substantially obtains or defeats the relief sought, as the case may be, whether by compromise, settlement, judgment, or the abandonment by the other party of its claim or defense. The attorneys' fees award shall not be computed in accordance with any court fee schedule, but shall be such as to fully reimburse all attorneys' fees reasonably incurred. 

This Guaranty constitutes the entire agreement between Guarantor and Lessor with respect to the subject matter of this Guaranty and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations, representations and discussions, whether verbal or written, of the parties, pertaining to such subject matter. Guarantor is not relying on any representations, warranties or inducements from Lessor that are not expressly stated in this Guaranty. 

If any provision of this Guaranty is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, all other provisions hereof shall nevertheless be effective. The waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this Guaranty shall not operate as a waiver of any other breach of such provision or any other provisions of this Guaranty, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege preclude any other or further such exercise or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Time is strictly of the essence under this Guaranty and any amendment, modification or revision of this Guaranty. 

Each person executing this Guaranty represents and warrants to Lessor that (i) each individual executing this Guaranty has the legal power, right, and actual authority to bind Guarantor; (ii) Guarantor has the legal right, power and authority to enter into and perform this Guaranty; (iii) all requisite action by or on behalf of a corporation, limited liability company, partnership (general or limited), trust or other legal entity ("entity") has been taken for this Guaranty to be duly authorized by such entity or Guarantor; (vi) no consent of any partner, shareholder, member, creditor, investor, government, judicial or administrative body or other party is required in connection with Guarantor executing this Guaranty; (v) this Guaranty is a valid and legally binding obligation of Guarantor; (vi) the execution and delivery of this Guaranty does not conflict with or result in the material breach of any terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any bond, note, or other evidence of indebtedness or any contract, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan, partnership agreement or other agreements or instruments to which Guarantor is a party or by which Guarantor is bound; and (vi) Guarantor will derive a substantial and material economic benefit from Lessor's execution of the Lease. If Guarantor is an entity, Guarantor shall, concurrently with the execution of this Guaranty (or upon ten (10) days' prior written notice from Lessor), deliver to Lessor a certified copy of a resolution or other documentation evidencing that such entity is authorized or ratifies the entity's execution of this Guaranty. 

The term "person" as used in this Guaranty shall include an individual and/or an entity. If more than one (1) person comprises Guarantor, the obligations of such persons shall be joint and several. The unenforceability of this Guaranty or Lessor's election not to enforce this Guaranty against one (1) or more persons shall not affect the obligations of the remaining persons which comprise Guarantor or the enforceability of this Guaranty against such remaining persons. 

Any notice, request, demand, instruction or other communication to be given to Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be in writing and shall be delivered at either the Premises or the address set forth beneath the Guarantor's signature below, or to such other place as Guarantor may from time to time in writing designate by at least fifteen (15) days' notice to Lessor.
