 PART I 
 
 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 
 Company Overview and Plan of Operation 
 
 The Company was founded with the name, Beeba s Creations, Inc., originally as a California corporation and was a wholesale importer and distributor of clothing, home de cor and tabletop products it manufactured under its own specifications and distributed in the United States under its own brand labels and other retailer-owned private labels. It changed its name to Nitches, Inc. in 1995 and the Company moved jurisdiction to Nevada in 2008. 
 
 On November 5, 2020, International Ventures Society, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, was appointed custodian of the Company pursuant to an Order of District Court of Clark County, Nevada. On November 6, the Company adopted amended Articles of Incorporation, which created the 2020 Series A Preferred Stock, with one share authorized. This one share effectively controls the Company by representing no less than 60 of all combined votes of Common and Preferred Stock at any time, and was issued to International Ventures Society LLC on the same day. 
 
 On December 16, 2020, International Ventures Society, LLC sold the one outstanding share of 2020 Series A Preferred Stock to Accelerate Global Market Solutions, a change of control transactions that resulted in John Morgan becoming CEO and launching the Company s new business plan. 
 
 Business Overview 
 
 Nitches works one-on-one with social media influencers from design concept through final manufacturing and distribution to deliver select, superior quality products that reflect the personalities of their unique brands. The social media influencers market the products to their followers on their own social media platforms versus spending excessive amounts on advertising in traditional media. 
 
 The Nitches corporation is focused on distribution and production of household, lifestyle, travel leisure, and sports goods and clothing, with a long-term objective of bringing sustainable business practices to the supply chain for these products. Our method is to identify business partners that are innovating outside of the box of what is currently trendy in the market and outside of the box of traditional marketing. Nitches aims to find the diamonds in the rough before the world knows about them. Our objective is to find brands (or people that have brands and people that ARE brands) that are on their way to the top of their verticals with new tech, new concepts, or state-of-the-art patents and then we take them there; these social influencers are our partners (our Social Media Partners for whom we will white-label and back-end brand merchandise and with whom we will drive demand for goods from sustainable supply chains. 
 
 The Company is again in the business of wholesale manufactured goods, but it white-labels them under the brand names of our Social Media Partners and also distributes them in an on-line department store where each of our Social Media Partners can sell their respective white-labeled merchandise marketing them first to their own social media followers as the patient zeros of their viral marketing campaigns to commercialize the personal brands they have built. Our business plan is place orders with global manufacturers of high margin household, lifestyle, travel leisure, and sporting goods, white label these products under the brands that Our Social Media Partners have already cultivated, and then use the social media follower base of Our Social Media Partners to market and promote the products and distribute them through on-line store on the Nitches website, https://nitchescorp.com/brands/. This marketplace stitches niches of fans together in an on-line bazaar hence Nitches. 
 
 Management believes we will not need an actual sales team to market our white-labeled products as our stable of Social Media Partners each have a built-in market to advertise their merchandise to simply by featuring their own brand merchandise in their social media content. 
 
 Management plans to create an equity incentive program whereby our Social Media Partners can earn and vest shares of our common stock by achieving certain social media analytics and sales thresholds thereby being compensated them for the strength of their social media follower base. Management believes this strategy will be key to attracting strong social media influencers as their modus operandi is capitalizing on their influence, or follower base. We do not anticipate launching our equity incentive plan before the 4th quarter of 2023 and do not yet have a specific time-frame for doing so. 
 1 
 
 The first line of goods we have made available to our Social Media Partners to white-label is athleisure clothing (clothing designed for exercise and everyday use) as management believes the purpose of the first good to be sold should be to test the market and build brand awareness. We believe our Nitches clothing and lifestyle products will mesh seamlessly with the social media content of our Social Media Partners as social media is all about showcasing lifestyle. 
 
 One Social Media Partner s on-line store is already open and selling its first product and another one is opening soon; one can check them out here: https://nitchescorp.com/brands/. So far both brands have placed bulk orders for merchandise which have been fulfilled, but sales have just begun so far only selling a dozen or so items. 
 
 Nitches developed the NITCHES OVS its industry-changing Owner Verification System (OVS mobile app called NITCHES OVS , an application (app) that can be used to verify authenticity and ownership of Nitches luxury products, apparel and streetwear clothing items. The Company believes registering the product and its unique QR code as an NFT will help protect each brand and their name, image and likeness as well as make the purchase of its goods a unique irreplaceable experience for customers. 
 
 Nitches has successfully submitted the NITCHES OVS app to Apple iTunes (iPhone) and Google Play (Android) stores. It is now available for buyers who purchase products from stores registered with Nitches. NITCHES OVS is On October 21, 2021, Nitches signed its first Celebrity Influencer Mr. John Lewis aka The Badass Vegan https://badassvegan.com for its first branded clothing line. As part of the contract, Nitches will be launching 10 clothing items for Mr. John Lewis aka The Badass Vegan, our brand ambassador, with a lead time of 30 days for the first 10 clothing items and styles to be produced and custom manufactured through Nitches. The collection is now for sale and a limited number of orders have already been placed and fulfilled. 
 
 A template of our Brand Ambassador Agreement is attached at Exhibit 6.1, a version of which we sign with each of our Social Media Partners. The agreements have a term of three years and may be extended by written agreement of both parties. The agreements grant the Company a license to use the ambassadors image in our public relations, advertising and marketing to promote company products. The ambassador has the responsibility to use their social media and participate in certain activities to help promote the Company s products. The ambassador is entitled to 50 of the Company s net profits from the ambassador s brand. For more information regarding these agreements, see the Brand Ambassador Agreement attached as Exhibit 6.1. 
 
 A rundown of our agreements with each of our Social Media Partners follows: 
 
 On March 8, 20211, Nitches signed an agreement with visual artist Anthony Piper will design and write the creative concepts around the collaborative Peace on Marz campaign. Peace on Marz is the result of a collaboration with Viral Vegan Influencer and Filmmaker John Lewis to create a luxury athleisure clothing collection and comprehensive NFT strategy aimed at protecting our planet. An important part of the project is developing an animated story for Peace on Marz, which will have a similar creative artistic flair as to Trill League, his celebrated web comic and graphic novel. Trill League is a hip-hop infused vision of a black superhero universe. For the Peace on Marz campaign, Piper will develop and creative direct a new Intellectual Property (IP) consisting of multi-faceted Marz Variant characters, eye-catching drawings and compelling storylines. 
 
 On March 22, 2022, Nitches signed an agreement to design a limited-edition capsule collection with illustrious Football Coach Steve Calhoun and his Armed and Dangerous Football Camp. The pro-style training camps prepare quarterbacks, wide receivers, tight ends, running backs, defensive backs, safeties and linebackers for the next level and beyond. In addition to designing a capsule collection of branded clothing and apparel items, Nitches renowned artists will work with Armed and Dangerous to create collectible NFTs (non-fungible tokens) that can be used by buyers as Digital Art. Management s strategy use the white-labeled sporting goods ordered under this influencer s brand to further develop relationships with manufacturers of high margin goods as a necessary step in diversifying the Nitches branded product lines outward from the athleisure clothing. 
 
 Management believes Nitches Corporation will give our clients and partners access to many of the key alternative production countries. To date, the manufacturers we have used have been located in Hong Kong, but we are continually evaluating other prospects located in different countries. China manufacturing is not the only place that you can get quality mass production at high levels. Working with multiple partner facilities across Asia gives us the best ability to get the right quality production capacity coupled with the lowest price to ensure your high-volume output. Because we work on a per-project basis and have not yet entered into any long-term partnerships with any single manufacturer, 
 2 
 
 we are able to better protect ourselves from risks related to any individual market and ensure we are receiving quality results at a low price. 
 
 On November 25, 2022, management decided to close-down all of its metaverse and NFT initiatives due to prohibitive costs of development, uncertainty of their monetization, and the early results of so-called industry leaders in metaverse development. The only remaining activities/initiatives involving NFTs are in regards to our Nitches OVS platform, as described below. 
 
 Additionally, management abandoned plans to accept cryptocurrency for our online stores due to volatility of price and the concerns that created for management in managing its supply chain. We had not yet begun to accept any cryptocurrencies in our online store(s). 
 
 The company finalized its obligations to assist and launch the Peace on Mars (POM) NFT collection on behalf of the project owner, our Social Media Partner, John Lewis. The Company was responsible to contract with the artist and pay the fees to mint the collection on opensea.io. The collection has been minted and can be viewed at the following address: https://opensea.io/collection/peace-on-marz. Custody of the NFT will be with the individual that goes to the link to mint it, from there it will be distributed to the individual users digital (Ethereum) wallet. The purpose of the making the POM NFTs available for minting is just to build brand recognition for POM. 
 
 They will be transferable and able to be sold on opensea.io, a website to explore, collect, and sell NFTs OpenSea ). Open Sea charges a transaction fee on trade of an NFT called a gas fee 1 . Nitches s role in the minting of the NFTs is hosting the mint page on its website from the which the NFT connects to the block chain and will be transferred to the user s digital wallet. As the host of the mint page for the NFTs, the Company is eligible to receive a portion of the gas fees from any sales of the NFTs on the Open Sea platform, which equate to about 6 of any resale through the Open Sea platform. However, the POM NFTs were minted just to build brand recognition for the collection. We do not anticipate any meaningful revenue from the NFTs but are optimistic that they will help with brand recognition and therefore increase product sales. Our only remaining obligations with the POM project relate to promoting and offering the product line in accordance with our Brand Ambassador Agreement. 
 
 Anti-Knockoff Owner Verification System (OVS 
 
 In March of 2022, Nitches completed its industry-changing Owner Verification System (OVS mobile app called NITCHES OVS . Nitches has successfully submitted the NITCHES OVS app to Apple iTunes (iPhone) and Google Play (Android) stores. It is now available for buyers who purchase products from stores registered with Nitches. NITCHES OVS is an application (app) that can be used to prove ownership of Nitches luxury products, apparel and streetwear clothing items. 
 
 Nitches developed the NITCHES OVS to show the authenticity of its limited-edition capsule collections and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) that are created with well-known celebrities and influencers. To reduce costs on Ethereum gas fees, Nitches minted its NFTs on the polygon blockchain network. Polygon is faster and less expensive for transactions than Ethereum. 
 
 Nitches plans to provide its NITCHES OVS to other businesses that want to protect their products, apparel and clothing from counterfeiting. According to Ghost Data, about 20 percent of fashion products advertised on social media are fake. 
 
 The NFTs minted through NITCHES OVS are a digital asset designed to help protect businesses from counterfeiters and to provide consumers with verification that the good purchased is authentic and not a pirated good. Each product sold by the Company will have a unique QR code that, if the purchaser so desires, can be linked to an NFT which will verify the identity of that product and confirm its authenticity. The Company does not anticipate the NFTs to have any value separate from the goods they are authenticating, and any transfer of the NFTs will come in conjunction with the sale of the goods which they are authenticating. The minting of each NFT will be complete at the time of purchase and there will be no fractionalization of the NFTs. There is no dividends, royalties, or other common enterprise that the holders of the NFTs will be entitled to. The NFTs are purely a verification token designed to protect businesses and consumers from counterfeit goods. 
 
 1 This FAQ on the OpenSea website explains what gas fees are, why they are needed, who gets them: https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500006315941-What-are-gas-fees- 
 3 
 
 The Company believes registering the product and its unique QR code as an NFT will help protect each brand and their name, image and likeness as well as make the purchase of its goods a unique irreplaceable experience for customers by owning a unique wearable NFT clothing item. The Company believes this will increase engagement with the Company s social media presence creating an on-line community of its customers thereby improving brand identity for the Company - while also preventing counterfeiting and allowing true verification (consumers and customers can verify they are real and authentic) of authentication (authenticity) of its products with various entertainers, celebrities and social media influencers. However the Company does not believe the NFT will have any value separate from the value of the physical item and purchasers of the physical goods should not expect any capital appreciation of the NFT. 
 
 The OVS App is being built on the Ethereum, an open public decentralized platform, where no single person or group has control. The App will integrate with leading Ethereum/Polygon wallets, including MetaMask, Ledger Nano X, TronLink, Scatter, Coinbase and Trust. The purpose of the NFT created in the OVS App is to verify the good purchased and verify to anyone that it is authentic and not a pirated good infringing on the brand using the OVS App. 
 
 The decision whether to mint the NFT is solely within the purchaser of the good and the purchaser has custody over the NFT it decides to mint; each NFT minted has a unique QR code that links to a verification of the good purchased with its purchase date, which also serves to verify if the good was purchased as part of a capsule collection. The NFT is transferable and designed to be transferred to a buyer of the good it authenticates, however that is purely up to the buyer and seller to decide and negotiate between themselves. There does exist a second-hand market for vintage clothing and sneakers, in which Nitches OVS verified goods could be sold with ownership of the minted NFT authenticating the good being transferred to the buyer along with the transfer of the actual verified vintage good being purchased. 
 
 We do not anticipate the NFT having any value separate from the good it authenticates in that it is not likely to be bought or sold and only transferred with the sale of the good it verifies, however there will be no restrictions on the transfer of the NFT minted by the purchaser of the good. As Nitches will have zero custody over the minted NFT, these decisions will not be made by management but instead by consumers, and Nitches will not profit from or participate in the NFT in any way; the opportunity to mind the NFT is being provided by the Nitches through its Nitches OVS App solely to prohibit piracy of the goods sold by our Social Media Partners. 
 
 Management believes it is quite possible a NFT OVS verified good may sell for more on a secondary market than an unverified good but does not assert any particular expertise in how development of the metaverse and NFTs will go from here. It only asserts that we believe there is a need to verify the authenticity of purchase goods which the NFTs minted with the Nitches OVS App. Purchasers of NFTs including those minting NFTs with the Nitches OVS App should be advised that NFT are not a reliable store of value and that they may lose any and all money or other costs incurred in obtaining custody of an NFT. 
 
 A second phase of our growth plan will be to consult for, partner with, or acquire our manufacturing vendors to rework their supply chains to qualify for certain Sustainable Manufacturing Certifications. We have not yet begun any partnerships with any manufacturers and so far only vendor-customer relationships with the manufacturers we have done business with. 
 
 In our business plan, the brands of our Social Media Partners that we white-labels products under are an entryway to strategic partnerships with global manufacturers of product ready to scale production to take advantage of the effects of our marketing campaigns. We will act as consultants - and financiers - to these manufacturers to scale their production in a sustainable supply and distribution chain. The demand for sustainable products will be driven by the follower base our Social Media Partners for whom it will be important because it is important to the social media influencers they are following and with whom we are partnering. 
 
 Management plans for the payments for such consultancies, will be in the form of revenue or profit-sharing arrangements with these manufacturers in order to give multiple streams of revenue, which management believes could be bundled and securitized once matured for later stage financing, which the Company could use to finance or acquire and scale those of these manufacturers that have shown growth and/or the most innovation in sustainability. 
 
 We could even use a portion of this bundled stream of income for cash giveaway sweepstakes run by our influencers with their follower base as product and cash giveaways is a proven effective means to increase social media engagement, which will attached more influencers to Nitches because they would then be able to use our giveaways to increase their followers while promoting our Nitches branded products. 
 4 

Management believes this phase of our business plan will lead to residual streams of income from the financing we provide to our manufacturing partners. As these streams of income mature and become more credit-worthy, our plan is to bundle those streams of income - whose credit is bolstered by the marketing of our Nitches lifestyle influencers - to offer a corporate bond, the proceeds of which will be used to finance the expansion and creation of a totally sustainable supply chain and distribution chain for our global manufacturers. Because the use of funds would be used to scale sustainable carbon-neutral manufacturing, management believes such financing would qualify as for ESG (Environmental, Social, or Governance) financing. ESG investing is investing in companies that score highly on environmental and societal responsibility scales as determined by third-party, independent companies and research groups. ESG investing is investing in companies that score highly on environmental and societal responsibility scales as determined by third-party, independent companies and research groups. Management believes Nitches will score well on such scales by living our company ethos and vision -- as well as through the use of consultants expert in qualifying for ESG investing. 
 
 A third phase will be when those influencers that meet certain analytics and sales thresholds begin to qualify for the Nitches Equity Incentive Plan for Social Media Influencers Equity Incentive Plan ), however we do not intend to begin the Equity Incentive Plan until after our planned growth with our manufacturing vendors and not have not yet set any thresholds or benchmarks for when equity would be granted and/or vested. Management does not believe it will be able to set any such benchmarks at least until the August 31, 2023 financials have been reported. For the Equity Incentive Program, we will use our publicly traded common stock for an Equity Incentive Plan for Social Media Influencers with the equity vesting based upon their achievement of certain social media analytics milestones based upon impressions and conversions when posting content showcasing our Nitches products. 
 
 Company Ethos, Vision is reflected in the Nitches Brand. 
 
 Our business model is anchored in a long-term vision that builds on the heritage of our brands and stimulates creativity and excellence for the next generation of sustainable living. The success of the marketing of our products will be based on our company living this vision with its operations. 
 
 The Nitches Corporation, as a company committed to excellence, we believe that our integrity and ethics are the most important thing. That s why we conduct ourselves with exemplary integrity and ethics in the conduct of our business and in our relations with all stakeholders. 
 
 Rules of conduct, principles and guidelines governing ethics and environmental and social responsibility have been defined to establish the behavior required of the Group s executives and employees, as well as our suppliers and partners.

 Company History and Summary 
 
 Nitches Inc is a diversified company that specializes in creating merchandise, manufacturing high end luxury brands, goods and collectibles for influencers and celebrities. Nitches is focused on sports clothing, athleisure brands, sustainable products, NFTs and technology. We are also taking tremendous steps to protect Nitches and our clients intellectual property by innovating technology to help prevent counterfeiting. In addition to the merchandise and manufacturing, Nitches is partnering with brands that are innovating outside of the box. Our business model is anchored in a long-term vision that builds on the heritage of our brands and stimulates creativity and excellence. Nitches empowers brands, celebrities and influencers with customized merchandise to increase their bottom line from their notoriety and social fame in this social age. 
 
 The Company was founded originally as a California corporation as a wholesale importer and distributor of clothing, home d cor and tabletop products manufactured to our specifications and distributed in the United States under our brand labels and retailer-owned private labels. The Company moved jurisdiction to Nevada in 2008. 
 
 On November 5, 2020, International Ventures Society, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, was appointed custodian of the Company pursuant to an Order of District Court of Clark County, Nevada. On November 6, the Company adopted amended Articles of Incorporation, which created the 2020 Series A Preferred Stock, with one share authorized. This one share effectively controls the Company by representing no less than 60 of all combined votes of Common and Preferred Stock at any time, and was issued to International Ventures Society LLC on the same day. 
 
 On December 16, 2020, International Ventures Society, LLC sold the one outstanding share of 2020 Series A Preferred Stock to Accelerate Global Market Solutions, Inc., a change of control transactions that resulted in John Morgan becoming CEO. This share of 2020 Series A Preferred Stock was converted into 100,000,000 shares of Common Stock on November 4, 2021. 
 
 Since February 2022, the Company has announced the completion and launch of its Nitches OVS mobile app, which can be used to prove ownership of the Company s luxury products, apparel and streetwear clothing items, as well as clothing collections in collaboration with legendary football coach Steve Calhoun; superstar vocal coach Nick Cooper; vegan influencer John Lewis; and world-famous artist Voodoo Fe with a collection to honor the legendary Miles Davis. In addition, the Company has announced an NFT campaign to focus on inclusivity and the development of its own exclusive clothing line to promote mental well- being. 
 
 On April 5, 2022, the Company executed amended loan notes which, in each case, changed the conversion terms from 0.00001 per share to a 50 discount to the lowest market price experienced in the 20 trading days prior to conversion. 
 8 
 
 On July 21, 2022, the Company announced it had repaid all outstanding loan notes and convertible loan notes, leaving the Company completely debt-free. To the end of August 2022, the Company continued to work on development and promotion of its clothing ranges. 
 
 On November 25, 2022, the Company announced that it had ceased its involvement in the Metaverse project to focus on selling merchandise in the short term. 
 
 On March 22, 2023, the Company announced an expansion into the liquor industry with the launch of lifestyle of spirits, focused on the launch of an exclusive premium aged whiskey under the Tover brand name. In furtherance of this expansion, the Company entered into a beverage brand developer agreement with Brenton Foster in March 2023. 
 
 On May 18, 2023, the Company announced two new initiatives: a collaboration with the Association of Luxury Suite Directors ALSD as an exclusive vendor, providing premium staff clothing for the 2023 ALSD Conference and Tradeshow on July 9-11 at JW Marriott Indianapolis. Secondly, the Company is in talks with an unnamed Major League Baseball team to expand custom clothing options for their premium fans.

Net revenues for the year ended August 31, 2023 were 4,224, as compared to 710 for the year ended August 31, 2022, due to the launch of our Miles Davis clothing line. 
 
 Gross profits for the year ended August 31, 2023 were (17,130), as compared to (4,369) for the year ended August 31, 2022. 
 
 Total operating expenses were 426,070 for the year ended August 31, 2023, compared to 833,743 for the year ended August 31, 2022. The change is primarily derived from a decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses of 420,811 in 2023, as compared to 832,183 in 2022. 
 
 Other income (expense) was (383,818) for the year ended August 31, 2023 compared to 4,248 for the year ended August 31, 2022. The 388,066 decrease was primarily 128,090 in amortization of debt discount and derivative expenses associated with embedded liabilities in convertible debt, 222,277 in change in fair market value of derivatives, and 457,801 increase in interest expenses associated with borrowings. 
 
 For the year ended August 31, 2023, the Company reported a net loss of (827,018) as compared to a net loss of (834,134) for the year ended August 31, 2022. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of August 31, 2023, the Company had 344 in cash to fund its operations. The Company reported working capital deficit of (391,316) on August 31, 2023, as compared to a working capital of 167,942 at August 31, 2022, representing an increase in working capital deficit of 559,258. 
 
 The Company does not believe its current cash balance will be sufficient to allow the Company to fund its planned operating activities for the next twelve months. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations or substantially curtail some of its planned activities. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets and classification of liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 9 

As the Company continues to incur losses, achieving profitability is dependent on achieving a level of revenues adequate to support the Company s cost structure. The Company may never achieve profitability, and unless and until it does, the Company will continue to need to raise additional capital. Management intends to fund future operations through additional private or public equity offerings and may seek additional capital through arrangements with strategic partners from other sources. There can be no assurances, however, that additional funding will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. Any equity financing may be dilutive to existing shareholders. 
 
 Operating Activities: 
 
 For the year ended August 31, 2023, net cash flow used by operating activities was 462,901, compared to 482,951 for the year ended August 31, 2022. 
 
 Financing Activities: 
 
 Net cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended August 31, 2023, were 416,353, of which 287,000 was from sales of common stock shares and 158,521 in proceeds from borrowings, compared to 570,038 for the year ended August 31, 2022. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resource Measures: 
 
 The Company s primary source of liquidity has been convertible loans and third party and related party loans. 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 The Company has experienced a net loss and had an accumulated deficit of 30,924,986 as of August 31, 2023. The success of our business plan during the next 12 months and beyond will be contingent upon generating sufficient revenue to cover our costs of operations and/or upon obtaining additional financing. 
 
 Transaction with Related Parties: 
 
 None 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 Refer to Note 2 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards and their related effects or anticipated effects on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. 
 
 Inflation and Changing Prices 
 
 We do not believe that inflation nor changing prices for the year ended August 31, 2023 had a material effect on our operations.

Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 The Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
 Nitches, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Nitches, Inc (the Company as of August 31, 2023, and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for the year ended August 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 31, 2023, and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended August 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles 
 
 Going Concern 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3, the Company suffered an accumulated deficit of (30,924,986), net loss of 827,018 and a negative working capital of 391,316. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans with regards to these matters are also described in Note 3 to the financial statements. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 
 Basis of Opinion 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. Communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. As of August 31, 2023, we do not have any critical audit matters to communicate.
