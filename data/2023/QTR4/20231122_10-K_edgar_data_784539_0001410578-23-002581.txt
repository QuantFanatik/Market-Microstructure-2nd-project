 PART I Item 1. Business EACO Corporation EACO ), incorporated in Florida in September 1985, is a holding company, primarily comprised of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bisco Industries, Inc. Bisco and Bisco s wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary, Bisco Industries Limited. Substantially all of EACO s operations are conducted through Bisco and Bisco Industries Limited. Bisco is a distributor of electronic components and fasteners with 51 sales offices and seven distribution centers located throughout the United States and Canada and 1 additional sales office location in the Philippines. Bisco supplies parts used in the manufacture of products in a broad range of industries, including the aerospace, circuit board, communication, computer, fabrication, instrumentation, industrial equipment and marine industries. Bisco commenced operations in Illinois in 1973 and was incorporated in 1974. Bisco s principal executive offices are located at 5065 East Hunter Avenue, Anaheim, California 92807, which also serves as the principal executive offices of EACO. EACO s website address is www.eacocorp.com and Bisco s website address is www.biscoind.com. The inclusion of these website addresses in this annual report does not include, or incorporate by reference into this annual report, any information on or accessible through the websites. EACO, Bisco and Bisco Industries Limited are collectively referred to herein as the Company, we, us and our. Operations Products and Services Bisco stocks thousands of items from more than 260 manufacturers. Bisco s products include electronic components such as spacers and standoffs, card guides and ejectors, component holders and fuses, circuit board connectors, and cable components, as well as a large variety of fasteners and hardware. The breadth of Bisco s products and extensive inventory provide a one-stop shopping experience for many customers. Bisco also provides customized services and solutions for a wide range of production needs, including special packaging, bin stocking, kitting and assembly, bar coding, electronic requisitioning, and integrated supply programs, among others. Divisions Bisco Industries Bisco sells a broad spectrum of products that it offers to many markets, but primarily sells to original equipment manufacturers OEMs ). While historically, the substantial majority of Bisco s revenues have been derived from the Bisco Industries division, Bisco has also established additional divisions that specialize in specific industries and products. Bisco believes that the focus by industry and/or product enhances Bisco s ability to provide superior service and devise tailored solutions for its customers. National-Precision The National-Precision division primarily sells electronic hardware and commercial fasteners to OEMs in the aerospace, fabrication and industrial equipment industries. National-Precision seeks to be the leading global distributor of mil-spec and commercial fasteners, hardware and distribution services used in production. Fast-Cor The Fast-Cor division was established to be a distributor s source for a broad range of components and fasteners. Fast-Cor has access to the entire inventory of products that Bisco offers but primarily focuses on selling to other distributors, not manufacturers.

 Customers and Sales Bisco s customers operate in a wide variety of industries and range from large global companies to small local businesses. Bisco strives to provide exceptional service to all customers, including smaller businesses, and continues to focus on growing its share of that market. As of August 31, 2023, Bisco had more than 10,000 customers; however, no single customer accounted for more than 10 of Bisco s revenues for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023. For each of the fiscal years ended August 31, 2023 and 2022 fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively), Bisco s top 20 customers represented in the aggregate approximately 13 of Bisco s revenues. Bisco generally sells its products through its sales representatives in its 51 sales offices located in the United States and Canada and 1 additional sales office in the Philippines. Customers can also place orders through Bisco s website. Bisco currently maintains seven distribution centers located in Anaheim and San Jose, California; Dallas, Texas; Chicago, Illinois; Boston, Massachusetts; Atlanta, Georgia; and Toronto, Canada. Each of Bisco s selling facilities and distribution centers are linked to Bisco s central computer system, which provides Bisco s management and salespersons with online, real-time data regarding inventory levels throughout Bisco and facilitates control of purchasing, shipping and billing. Bisco generally ships products to customers from one of its seven distribution centers, based on the geographic proximity to the customer and the location of the available ordered products. Bisco sells its products primarily in the United States, Canada, and countries within Asia. Bisco s international sales represented 11.3 and 11.8 of its sales in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. Sales to customers in Canada accounted for approximately 36 and 27 of such international sales in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. Sales to customers located within Asia accounted for approximately 40 and 48 of such international sales in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. Sales to customers in other countries make up 24 and 25 of such international sales in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively Suppliers As of August 31, 2023, Bisco offered products from over 260 manufacturers. The Company s authorized distributor agreements with most manufacturers are typically cancelable by either party at any time or on short notice. While Bisco doesn t manufacture its products, it does perform kitting and packaging of existing products for certain of its customers. Although Bisco sells more products of certain brands, Bisco believes that most of the products it sells are available from other sources at competitive prices. No single supplier accounted for more than 10 of Bisco s purchases in fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022. Human Capital Resources As of August 31, 2023, the Company had 561 full-time employees, which include 359 sales and marketing employees, 89 management, administrative and finance employees, 63 warehouse and fulfillment personnel and 50 supply chain management employees. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. A key element of our business strategy is to expand our operations and revenues by opening additional sales offices in new geographic locations, and we plan to add additional sales personnel to support such new offices. The Management believes it has been successful in attracting and retaining qualified sales personnel for these new positions. We continue to focus on employee development and training, and embrace diversity and inclusion. We believe an innovative workforce needs to be diverse and leverage the skills and perspectives of a wealth of backgrounds and experiences. Compliance with Government Regulations We are not aware of the need for any government approvals for our products. Because we use contract manufacturers, any laws regarding the manufacturing of the products we distribute will typically be the responsibility of our contract manufacturers. Prior to entering into any contracts with new manufacturers, we typically conduct diligence to determine that the manufacturer has satisfied all such requirements. We do not believe that we are subject to any state or federal environmental laws.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business is subject to a number of risks, some of which are discussed below. The risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered the only risks to which the Company is exposed. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be seriously harmed. In that event, the market price for shares of our common stock may decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Company and Operational Risks We generally do not have long-term supply agreements or guaranteed price or delivery arrangements with the majority of our suppliers. In most cases, we have no guaranteed price or delivery arrangements with our suppliers. Consequently, we may experience inventory shortages on certain products from time to time. Furthermore, our industry occasionally experiences significant product supply shortages and customer order backlogs due to the inability of certain manufacturers to supply products as needed. We cannot assure you that our suppliers will maintain an adequate supply of products to fulfill our orders on a timely basis, at a recoverable cost, or at all, or that we will be able to obtain particular products on favorable terms or at all. Additionally, we cannot assure you that product lines currently offered by suppliers will continue to be available to us. A decline in the supply or continued availability of the products of our suppliers, or a significant increase in the price of those products, could reduce our sales, harm our reputation and negatively affect our operating results. Our supply agreements are generally terminable at the suppliers discretion. Substantially all of the agreements we have with our suppliers, including our authorized distributor agreements, are terminable with little or no notice or penalty. Suppliers that currently sell their products through us could decide to sell, or increase their sales of, their products directly or through other distributors or channels. Any termination, interruption or adverse modification of our relationship with a key supplier or a significant number of other suppliers would likely adversely affect our operating income, cash flow and future prospects. We generally do not have long-term sales contracts with our customers. Most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts. As such, our customers typically do not have any obligation to purchase any products from us. A variety of conditions, both specific to each customer and generally affecting each customer s industry, may cause customers to reduce, cancel or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated. In addition, customers may go bankrupt or fail, or default on their payments. Significant or numerous cancellations, reductions, delays in orders by customers, losses of customers, and/or customer defaults on payment could materially adversely affect our business and revenues. We rely on third party suppliers for most of our products, and may not be able to identify and procure relevant new products and products lines that satisfy our customers needs on favorable terms and prices, or at all. We currently rely on a large number of third party suppliers for most of our products. Since we do not manufacture our products, we rely on these suppliers to provide quality products that are in demand by our customers. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop product expertise and continue to identify and provide future high quality products and product lines that complement our existing products and product lines and that respond to our customers needs. We may not be able to compete effectively unless we can continue to offer a broad range of high quality, reliable products that address the trends in the markets in which we compete. Our advertising and marketing efforts may be costly and may not achieve desired results. We expect to continue to incur substantial expense in connection with our advertising and marketing efforts. Postage represents a significant advertising expense for us because we generally mail flyers to current and potential customers through the U.S. Postal Service. Any future increases in postal rates will increase our mailing expenses and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, we spent 431,000 and 427,000 on advertising, respectively.

 Increases in the costs of energy, shipping and raw materials used in our products could impact our cost of goods and distribution and occupancy expenses, which would result in lower operating margins. Costs of raw materials used in our products and energy costs have been rising during the last several years, which has resulted in increased production costs for our suppliers. These suppliers typically look to pass their increased costs along to us through price increases. The shipping costs for our products have risen as well and may continue to rise. While we typically try to pass increased supplier prices and shipping costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact, we may not be successful. Failure to fully pass these increased prices and costs through to our customers or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating margins and could make our products less competitive, either of which could adversely impact our margins and results of operations. The unauthorized access to, or theft or destruction of, customer or employee personal, financial or other data or of our proprietary or confidential information that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues. The protection of customer, employee and Company data is critical to us. We are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments, consumer credit and fraud. Additionally, an increasing number of government and industry groups have established laws and standards for the protection of personal information. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. Compliance with these requirements may result in cost increases due to necessary system changes and the development of new administrative processes. If we fail to comply with laws and regulations regarding privacy and security, we could be subject to significant fines, and become subject to investigations, litigation and the disruption of our operations. In the ordinary course of business, we receive and maintain credit card and other personal information from our customers, employees and vendors. Customers and employees have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. Third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of this customer information, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to this information. A number of retailers have experienced security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been stolen. While we have not experienced a cyber attack, we are working with a third-party vendor to assist us in safeguarding our systems and protecting the personal information of our customers, employees and vendors. Our analysis may not be able to adequately address or remedy the potential harm, which could result in the assessment against us for large remedial costs and other penalties, and could damage our reputation and adversely impact our customers. We rely heavily on our internal information systems, which, if not properly functioning, could materially and adversely affect our business. Our information systems have been in place for many years and are subject to system failures as well as problems caused by human error, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our systems consist of a number of legacy or internally developed applications, which can be more difficult to upgrade to commercially available software. It may be time consuming and costly for us to retrieve data that is necessary for management to evaluate our systems of control and information flow. In the future, management may decide to convert our information systems to a single enterprise solution. Such a conversion, while it would enhance the accessibility and reliability of our data, could be expensive and would not be without risk of data loss, delay or business interruption. Maintaining and operating these systems requires continuous investments. Failure of any of these internal information systems or material difficulties in upgrading these information systems could have material adverse effects on our business and our timely compliance with our reporting obligations. We may not be able to attract and retain key personnel. Our future performance will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of certain key management and other personnel, including Glen Ceiley, our Chairman and CEO, and Don Wagner, Bisco President and Chief Operating Officer, as well as other executive officers and senior management. The loss of service of one or more of our key management members could have a material adverse effect on our business.

 The competitive pressures we face could have a material adverse effect on our business. The market for our products and services is very competitive. We compete for customers with other distributors, who sell similar or sometimes identical products, as well as with many of our suppliers. A failure to maintain and enhance our competitive position could adversely affect our business and prospects. Furthermore, our efforts to compete in the marketplace could cause deterioration of gross profit margins and, thus, overall profitability. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, personnel, capacity and other resources or a more extensive customer base than we do. Expansion Risks Our strategy of expanding into new geographic areas could be costly and may not expand our revenues. One of our primary growth strategies is to grow our business through the opening of sales offices in new geographic markets. This strategy requires continued investment, both financially, as well as management s efforts to get the new offices operational. Based on our analysis of demographics in the United States, Canada, Mexico and countries within Asia, we currently estimate there is potential market opportunity in North America and Asia to support additional sales offices. We cannot guarantee that our estimates are accurate or that we will open enough offices to capitalize on the full market opportunity or that any new offices will be successful or profitable in the near future, or at all. In addition, a particular local market s ability to support a sales office may change due to competition or local economic conditions. We may be unable to meet our goals regarding new office openings. Our growth, in part, is primarily dependent on our ability to attract new customers. Historically, our most effective way to attract new customers has been opening new sales offices in additional geographic regions or new markets. During fiscal 2023, the Company opened two new geographical sales locations and relocated some existing locations to larger office locations within its original region. Given the recent economic uncertainty, we may not be able to open or grow new offices at our projected or desired rates or hire the qualified sales personnel necessary to make such new offices successful. Failure to do so could negatively impact our long-term growth and market share. Opening sales offices in new markets presents increased risks that may prevent us from being profitable in these new locations, and/or may adversely affect our operating results. Our new sales offices do not typically achieve operating results comparable to our existing offices until after several years of operation. The added expenses relating to payroll, occupancy, and transportation costs can impact our ability to generate earnings. Offices in new geographic areas face additional challenges to achieving profitability, and we cannot guarantee how long it will take new offices to become profitable, or that such offices will ever become profitable. In new markets, we have less familiarity with local customer preferences and customers in these markets are less familiar with our name and capabilities. Entry into new markets may also bring us into competition with new, unfamiliar competitors. These challenges associated with opening new offices in new markets may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. Our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified sales personnel is uncertain. Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract, motivate, and retain a sufficient number of qualified sales employees, who understand and appreciate our strategy and culture and are able to adequately represent us to our customers. During fiscal 2023, the Company added 49 sales employees and plan to continue to expand our sales team in the future. Qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas, and the turnover rate in the industry is high. If we are unable to hire and retain personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service, as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and product knowledge, our sales could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees. An inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may also delay the planned openings of new offices. Any such delays, material increases in existing employee turnover rates, or increases in labor costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.

 Financial Risks We have incurred significant losses in the past from trading in securities, and we may incur such losses in the future, which may also cause us to be in violation of covenants under our loan agreement. Bisco has historically supplemented its capital resources in part from cash generated by trading in marketable domestic equity securities. Bisco s investment strategy includes taking both long and short positions, as well as utilizing options to maximize return. This strategy can lead, and has led, to significant losses from time to time based on market conditions and trends, as well as the performance of the specific companies in which we invest. We may incur losses in future periods from such trading activities, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. In addition, unanticipated losses from our trading activities may cause Bisco to be in violation of certain covenants under its line of credit agreement with Citizen s Business Bank, located in Anaheim, CA. The agreement is secured by substantially all of Bisco s assets. The loan agreement contains covenants which require that, on a quarterly basis, Bisco s losses from trading in securities not exceed its pre-tax operating income. We cannot assure you that unanticipated losses from our trading activities will not cause us to violate our covenants in the future or that the bank will grant a waiver for any such default or that it will not exercise its remedies, which could include the refusal to allow additional borrowings on the line of credit or the acceleration of the obligation s maturity date and foreclosure on Bisco s assets, with respect to any such noncompliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. We may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources. Our ability to satisfy our cash needs depends on our ability to generate cash from operations and to access our line of credit and the capital markets, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In October 2023, the Company used 31.0 million of cash to purchase our Anaheim corporate headquarters and distribution center. As of August 31, 2023, there was zero outstanding on our line of credit, which line of credit is secured by substantially all of Bisco s assets. Further, the Company has a loan agreement with the Bank that financed the tenant improvements on the corporate headquarters, of which approximately 4.5 million was outstanding as of August 31, 2023. See Notes 4 and 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further explanation. Our ability to continue to secure financing is subject to our satisfaction of certain covenants contained in such agreements. As a result of the recent economic uncertainty primarily caused by inflation and high borrowing interest rates, we may need to pursue additional debt or equity financing, which funding may not be available on acceptable or favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. The securities that might be issued in any future equity financing may have rights, preferences, and privileges that are senior to our common stock. Our failure to obtain such funding could adversely impact our ability to execute our business plan and our financial condition and results of operations. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk, and changes in foreign exchange rates could increase our costs to procure products and impact our foreign sales. Because the functional currency related to our Canadian operations and certain of our foreign vendor purchases is the applicable local currency, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business. Fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies and their related currencies could adversely impact our ability to procure products overseas at competitive prices and our foreign sales. Historically, our primary exchange rate exposure has been with the Canadian dollar. Concentration of Ownership Risks The Company s Chairman and CEO holds almost all of our voting stock and can control the election of directors and significant corporate actions. Glen Ceiley, our Chairman and CEO, beneficially owns or controls approximately 96 of our outstanding voting stock. As such, Mr. Ceiley is able to exert significant influence over the outcome of almost all corporate matters, including the election of the Board of Directors and significant corporate transactions requiring a stockholder vote, such as a merger or a sale of the Company or our assets. This concentration of ownership and influence in management and board decision-making could also harm the price of our common stock by, among other things, discouraging a potential acquirer from seeking to acquire shares of our common stock (whether by making a tender offer or otherwise) or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.

Table of Contents 
 Sales of our common stock by Glen Ceiley could cause the price of our common stock to decline. There is currently no established trading market for our common stock, and the volume of any stock sales has generally been low. As of August 31, 2023, the number of shares held by non-affiliates of Mr. Ceiley was less than 200,000 shares. If Mr. Ceiley sells or seeks to sell a substantial number of his shares of our common stock in the future, the market price of our common stock could decline. The perception among investors that these sales may occur could produce the same effect. Due to the limited available public float, certain investors may not be able or willing to invest in the Company s securities, which could also impact the market price of our common stock. General Risk Factors Changes and uncertainties in the economy have harmed and could continue to harm our operating results. As a result of economic uncertainties primarily caused by inflation and high borrowing interest rates, our operating results, and the economic strength of our customers and suppliers, are increasingly difficult to predict. Sales of our products are affected by many factors, including, among others, general economic conditions, interest rates, inflation, liquidity in the credit markets, unemployment trends, shipping costs, geopolitical events, and other factors. Although we sell our products to customers in a broad range of industries, if economic conditions significantly weaken on a global scale it may cause some of our customers to experience a slowdown, from time to time, which may in turn have an adverse effect on our sales and operating results. Changes and uncertainties in the economy also increase the risk of uncollectible accounts receivable. The pricing we receive from suppliers may also be impacted by general economic conditions. Continued and future changes and uncertainties in the economic climate in the United States and elsewhere could have a similar negative impact on the rate and amounts of purchases by our current and potential customers, create price inflation for our products, or otherwise have a negative impact on our expenses, gross margins and revenues, and could hinder our growth. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting or experience material weaknesses in our system of internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business. We have from time to time had material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting due to a variety of issues, including, without limitation, significant deficiencies in the process related to the preparation of our financial statements, segregation of duties, sufficient control in the area of financial reporting oversight and review, and appropriate personnel to ensure the complete and proper application of GAAP as it relates to certain routine accounting transactions. Although we believe we are making progress in mitigating these material weaknesses, we may experience material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the future and may fail to maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting that complies with the applicable reporting. Our failure to address any deficiencies or weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or to properly maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could impact our ability to prevent fraud or to issue our financial statements in a timely manner that presents fairly, in accordance with GAAP, our financial condition and results of operations. The existence of any such deficiencies and/or weaknesses, even if cured, may also lead to the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, could harm our business and negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. Such deficiencies or material weaknesses may also subject us to lawsuits, investigations and other penalties. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.

 Item 6. Selected Financial Data The Company is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not required to provide the information required under this item. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results Of Operations You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. Overview EACO is a holding company primarily comprised of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bisco, and includes Bisco s wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary, Bisco Industries Limited. Bisco is a distributor of electronic components and fasteners with 51 sales offices and seven distribution centers located throughout North America and one sales office in Asia located in the Philippines. Bisco supplies parts used in the manufacture of products in a broad range of industries, including the aerospace, circuit board, communication, computer, fabrication, instrumentation, industrial equipment and marine industries. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Revenue Recognition We derive our revenue primarily from product sales. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. The Company s performance obligations consist solely of product shipped to customers. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers at a point in time in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for these products. Revenue is recognized net of returns and any taxes collected from customers. We offer industry standard contractual terms in our purchase orders. Deferred Tax Assets Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets DTAs and deferred tax liabilities DTLs reflect management s best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the United States. Significant judgments and estimates are required in the determination of the consolidated income tax expense. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our DTAs in the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of DTLs, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal, and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. The assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income.

 Inventory The Company s inventory provisions for obsolescence are based upon management s review of inventories on-hand over their expected future utilization and length of time held by the Company. The Company s methodology for estimating these adjustments to the cost basis is evaluated for factors that could require changes to the cost basis including significant changes in product demand, market conditions, condition of the inventory or net realizable value. If business or economic conditions change, the Company s estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate. Results of Operations Comparison of the Fiscal Years Ended August 31, 2023 and 2022 Revenues and Gross Margin (dollars in thousands) 

Fiscal Years Ended August 31, 2023 2022 Change Change Revenues 319,397 292,562 26,835 9.2 Cost of revenues 226,981 209,060 17,921 8.6 Gross margin 92,416 83,502 8,914 10.7 Percent of revenues 28.9 28.5 Revenues consist primarily of sales of component parts and fasteners and also include, to a lesser extent, kitting charges and special order fees, as well as freight charged to customers. The increase in revenues in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was largely due to a higher volume of product sales due to a better economic environment creating higher volume of purchases and additional buying from manufacturers. Revenues have also increased due to added sales employees during fiscal 2023, increasing by 49 employees when comparing to fiscal 2022. We believe that increasing sales headcount leads to the addition of new customers and the ability to sell more products to existing customers. Additionally, revenues and gross margin for fiscal 2023 have increased when compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to developing better relationships with vendors and customers and also higher inventory stock available and an increased demand for those products.

Fiscal Years Ended August 31, 2023 2022 Change Change Selling, general and administrative expenses 64,936 53,970 10,966 20.3 Percent of revenues 20.3 18.4 (1.9) Selling, general and administrative expense SG A consists primarily of payroll and related expenses for the sales and administrative staff, professional fees (including accounting, legal and technology costs and expenses), and advertising costs. SG A in fiscal 2023 increased from fiscal 2022 largely due to an increase in the number of sales and administrative employees, from 506 employees in fiscal 2022 to 561 employees in fiscal 2023. The increase in SG A when comparing fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2022 is primarily due to a prior year decrease in payroll taxes as a result of federal tax credits related to the Employee Retention Credit (ERC) of 5.3 million recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. SG A as a percent of revenue in the current period increased from the prior year period primarily due to the ERC offset in the prior year and higher payroll expenses in the current year.

The Company experienced net realized and unrealized gains from trading securities of approximately 1,284,000 and net realized and unrealized losses of approximately 213,000 in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. The trading securities gains and losses in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 were primarily due to timing of sale of investments and general market climate of investment positions at year-end. Interest and other expense decreased by 142,000, which was primarily due to interest income earned during the period that partially offset the interest expense.

The income tax provision as a percentage of pre-tax income decreased by 0.6 in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, which was primarily due to a lower blended state tax rate used in fiscal 2023 and also due to the fiscal 2022 tax provision having a larger return to provision and deferred true ups when comparing to fiscal 2023. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of August 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company held approximately 8,558,000 and 17,386,000 of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, respectively.

In addition, the Amendment removed the Company s interest rate options and set the rate at the bank prime rate, but provided that in no event would such interest rate be less than 3.0 per annum..During Q1 2023, the Company entered into a Change in Terms Agreement dated November 5, 2022 with the Bank (the Amendment ), which extended the maturity date of the line of credit from November 5, 2022 to July 5, 2024. and the Company intends to renew the line of credit beyond maturity.

In September 2019, Bisco entered into the Hunter Lease with the Trust, which is the grantor trust of Glen Ceiley, our Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board and the Company s majority shareholder. Under the Hunter Lease, Bisco leased from the Trust the Hunter Property, which consists of approximately 80,000 square feet of office and warehouse space located at 5065 East Hunter Avenue, Anaheim, California, which serves as the Company s new corporate headquarters.

 purchase price of 31,000,000. The Hunter Property was purchased with cash, funded by the Company s available cash accounts and liquidated securities. See note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for further explanation. In July 2019, the Company entered into a Construction Loan with the Bank to borrow up to 5,000,000 for the primary purpose of financing tenant improvements at the Hunter Property. The Construction Loan was a line of credit evidenced by a Promissory Note in the principal amount of up to 5,000,000 with a maturity date of May 15, 2027. The terms of the Construction Loan provide that the Company may only request advances through July 15, 2020, and thereafter, the Construction Loan would convert to a term loan with a fixed rate of 4.6 and entitled to a .25 rate discount if a demand deposit account is held with the Bank. On July 15, 2020, the amount drawn on the Construction Loan and converted to a term loan was 4,807,000. Interest on the Construction Loan is payable monthly (4.35 at August 31, 2023 and 2022). Concurrent with the execution of this Construction Loan, Bisco entered into a commercial security agreement, dated July 12, 2019, with the Bank, pursuant to which Bisco granted the Bank a security interest in substantially all of Bisco s personal property to secure Bisco s obligations under the Construction Loan. The outstanding balance of the Construction Loan at August 31, 2023 and August 31, 2022 was 4,584,000 and 4,698,000, respectively. EACO has also entered into a business loan agreement (and related 100,000 promissory note) with the Bank that is renewed annually in order to obtain a 100,000 letter of credit as security for the Company s workers compensation requirements. Cash Flows from Operating Activities During fiscal 2023, the Company provided 13,422,000 in net cash from its operating activities. The current period cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income of 21,185,000 and an increase in accrued expenses and in prepaid and other assets. This was partially offset by increases in trade accounts receivable and inventory. Increases in accrued expenses is primarily due to increases in inventory. During fiscal 2022, the Company provided 16,866,000 in net cash from its operating activities. The current period cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income of 21,308,000 and an increase in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was 23,815,000 for fiscal 2023. This was primarily due to the purchase of marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities was 2,236,000 for fiscal 2022. This was primarily due to the purchase of equipment for offices and distribution centers and the purchase of marketable securities. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2023 was 1,701,000, which was primarily due to an increase in bank overdraft when comparing fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2022. Bank overdraft represents outstanding checks in excess of cash held in our bank account. If the bank account is over drawn, the Company has a nightly sweep feature, which funds the cash account to the line of credit with the Bank. The cash used in financing activities for the prior period is primarily due to a decrease in the bank overdraft balance. Contractual Financial Obligations In addition to using cash flow generated from operations, the Company finances its operations through borrowings from banks. These financial obligations are recorded in accordance with accounting rules applicable to the underlying transactions, with the result that debt agreements are recorded as liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets while obligations under operating leases are disclosed in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. As required by Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Financial Executive, who also serves as the Company s principal financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Chief Financial Executive has concluded that the Company s controls and procedures were not effective as of August 31, 2023, due to a material weakness related to the Company s internal controls over the financial statement closing process (b) Management s annual report on internal control over financial reporting. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company s internal control over financial reporting is intended to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company s management, with the participation of its Chief Financial Executive, assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in its report entitled Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on that assessment under such criteria, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting has a material weakness as of August 31, 2023, related to the Company s internal controls over the financial statement closing process, including manual journal entries recorded in the preparation of the financial statements. Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, and/or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. The Company is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. As such, this annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. (c) Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of the year ended August 31, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B. Other Information None. Item 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections Not applicable.

Mr. Ceiley has a B.S. degree in Communications from the University of Colorado. Zach Ceiley is the son of Glen Ceiley, who is EACO s Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and majority shareholder and Bisco s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Code of Ethics EACO has adopted a code of ethics applicable to its senior executive and financial officers. You may receive, without charge, a copy of the Financial Code of Ethical Conduct by contacting our Corporate Secretary, c/o Bisco Industries, Inc., at 5065 East Hunter Avenue, Anaheim, California 92807. Concerns relating to accounting, internal controls or auditing matters should be brought to the attention of a member of our senior management or the Audit Committee as appropriate, and will be handled in accordance with the procedures established by the Audit Committee with respect to such matters. Director Independence EACO s Board currently consists of the following directors: Stephen Catanzaro, Glen Ceiley, Ellen Bancroft, and William L. Means. The Board has determined that three of its four directors, Stephen Catanzaro, Ellen Bancroft, and William L. Means, are independent as defined by the NASDAQ Stock Market s Marketplace Rules. In addition to such rules, the Board considered transactions and relationships between each director (and his immediate family) and the Company to determine whether any such relationships or transactions were inconsistent with a determination that the director is independent. As a result, the Board determined that Mr. Ceiley is not independent, as he is an executive officer of EACO and Bisco, a member of Bisco s steering committee and the holder of a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the Company. Bisco s steering committee handles the day to day operations of the Company, and Mr. Ceiley has been intimately involved with decision-making that directly affects the financial statements of the Company. Board Structure The Board does not have a policy regarding the separation of the roles of the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board as the Board believes it is in the best interest of the Company to make that determination based on the position and direction of the Company and the membership of the Board from time to time. Currently, Glen Ceiley, serves as the Chairman of the Board and CEO of both EACO and Bisco. The Board does not have a separate lead independent director, but the independent directors of the Company are actively involved in decision making by the Board. The Board has determined that the current structure is appropriate for the Company and enhances the Company s ability to execute its business and strategic plans and makes the best use of the CEO s knowledge of the Company and the industries that it serves, while maintaining strong independence over Board decisions and oversight through the involvement and participation of the independent directors.

 Board Meetings and Committees In accordance with the Bylaws of EACO, which empower the Board to appoint such committees as it deems necessary and appropriate, the Board has established an Audit Committee and an Executive Compensation Committee (the Compensation Committee ). During the fiscal 2023, the Board of Directors and the various committees of the Board held the following number of meetings: Board of Directors 4; Audit Committee 4; and Compensation Committee. During fiscal 2023, no director attended fewer than 75 of the aggregate of the total number of meetings of the Board of Directors and the total number of meetings of any committees of the Board held while he was serving on the Board or such committee. Audit Committee The Audit Committee s basic functions are to assist the Board in discharging its fiduciary responsibilities to the shareholders and the investment community in the preservation of the integrity of the financial information published by the Company, to maintain free and open means of communication between the Company s directors, independent auditors and financial management, and to ensure the independence of the independent auditors. The Board has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee, a copy of which was attached as Annex A to the Company s proxy statement for the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, as filed with the SEC on April 12, 2016. The Audit Committee charter is not available on EACO s website. The members of the Audit Committee are Stephen Catanzaro (Chairman), William Means, and Ellen Bancroft. The Board has determined that each of Stephen Catanzaro and William Means are independent under the independence standards for audit committee members as set forth in the NASDAQ Stock Market s Marketplace Rules and the applicable SEC rules. Ms. Bancroft was previously a partner with the Company s legal Counsel, Morgan Lewis Bockius LLP, until March 2021. As such, while Ms. Bancroft is independent for Board membership under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, she may not be independent under the applicable SEC rules for audit committee membership until March 2024. The Board has identified Mr. Catanzaro as the member of the Audit Committee who qualifies as an audit committee financial expert under applicable SEC rules and regulations governing the composition of the Audit Committee. Compensation Committee The Compensation Committee is generally responsible for establishing the salary and annual bonuses paid to executive officers of EACO and administering EACO s equity incentive plans, if any, including granting stock options to officers and employees of EACO. The Compensation Committee has not adopted a formal charter. The current members of the Compensation Committee are Glen Ceiley (Chairman), William Means, and Ellen Bancroft. The Board has determined that William Means and Ellen Bancroft are independent under the independence standards for Compensation Committee members as set forth in the NASDAQ Stock Market s Marketplace Rules. Mr. Ceiley is not an independent director.

 Nomination of Directors The Board does not have a Nominating Committee, but each director participates in the consideration of director nominees. Given the size and resources of EACO (and the large number of shares of common stock held by our majority shareholder), the Board believes that this approach is appropriate. The Board believes that having a separate committee would not enhance the nomination process. While the Board does not have a formal policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees, it strives to nominate directors with a variety of complementary skills and backgrounds so that, as a group, the Board will possess the appropriate talent, skills, insight and expertise to oversee our business. These factors, and others as considered useful by the Board, are reviewed in the context of an assessment of the perceived needs of the Board at a particular point in time. As a result, the priorities and emphasis of the Board may change from time to time to take into account changes in business and other trends, and the portfolio of skills and experience of current and prospective directors. The Board periodically reviews the performance of each Board member and concludes whether or not the member should continue in their current capacity. EACO has not adopted a charter relating to the director nomination process, however, the Board will consider candidates for directors recommended by our shareholders who meet the eligibility requirements for submitting recommendations as set forth in EACO s Bylaws. Eligible stockholders who seek to recommend a nominee must submit such recommendation in writing to the our Corporate Secretary (c/o Bisco Industries, Inc., at 5065 East Hunter Ave, Anaheim, California 92807), by the deadline for director nominations set forth in our last proxy statement, specifying the following information: (i) the name and address of the candidate; (ii) a brief biographical description, including the candidate s occupation for at least five years; (iii) a statement of the qualifications of the candidate; and (iv) the additional information concerning the candidate and the shareholder proposing such candidate as required by EACO s Bylaws. Such notice must be accompanied by a written consent of each candidate to being named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected. Directors should possess qualities such as an understanding of the Company s business and operations and corporate governance principles. In connection with its evaluation, the Board may request additional information from the candidate or the recommending shareholder, and may request an interview with the candidate. The Board has the discretion to decide which individuals to recommend for nomination as directors. No candidates for director nominations were submitted to the Corporate Secretary by any shareholder in connection with the election of directors at the Annual Meeting. Risk Oversight While our management has the primary responsibility for identifying and mitigating risks, the Board has the overall responsibility for the oversight of such risks, with a focus on the most significant risks facing the Company. The Board s duties in this regard are supplemented by committees of the Board. In particular, the Audit Committee focuses on financial risk, including internal controls, and is responsible for discussing with management and our independent auditors policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including the process by which we undertake major financial and accounting decisions. Risks related to our compensation programs are reviewed by the Compensation Committee. In connection with its responsibilities relating to risk assessment, our full Board receives reports on risk management from senior officers of the Company, including the CEO of the Company, and from the Chairman of the Audit Committee, and periodically engages in discussions of the most significant risks that the Company is facing and how these risks are being managed. While the Company has not experienced any material cyber attack or breach, the Board is currently evaluating cyber security risks and has retained a third party consultant to assist it in this regard. Throughout the year, the Board will dedicate a portion of their meetings to review and discuss specific risk topics in greater detail. Shareholder Communications The Board has established a process by which shareholders may send written communications to the attention of the Board, any committee of the Board or any individual Board member, care of our Corporate Secretary. The name of any specific intended Board recipient should be noted in the communication. Our Corporate Secretary will be primarily responsible for collecting, organizing and monitoring communications from shareholders and, where appropriate depending on the facts and circumstances outlined in the communication, providing copies of such communications to the intended recipients. Communications will be forwarded to directors if they relate to appropriate and important substantive corporate or Board matters. Communications that are of a commercial or frivolous nature, or are offensive or otherwise inappropriate for the Board s consideration will not be forwarded to the Board. Shareholders who wish to communicate with the Board can write to the Corporate Secretary at EACO Corporation, c/o Bisco Industries, Inc., at 5065 East Hunter Avenue, Anaheim, California 92807.

The officers of EACO are Mr. Ceiley, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, and Mr. Michael Narikawa, the Company s Chief Financial Executive and Principal Accounting Officer.

During fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, the Company paid approximately 1,162,000 and 1,134,000, respectively, of rent related to these leases. On November 21, 2017, Bisco entered into the Chicago Lease with the Trust for the Glendale Heights Property, which consists of office and warehouse space in Glendale Heights, Illinois. The initial base monthly rent is 22,600, which is subject to a 2.5 annual increase. On July 26, 2019, the Company entered into the Hunter Lease with the Trust, for the lease of the Hunter Property, which houses the Company s corporate headquarters. The Company completed its move to the new headquarters in March 2020. The term of the Hunter Lease commenced on September 2, 2019 and ended on October 23, 2023, when the Company completed the purchase of the Hunter Property from the Trust for the amount of 31,000,000. The Company agreed to the Property Purchase primarily to utilize its cash position and to reduce its corporate overhead expenses. The Hunter Property is expected to continue to house the Company s corporate headquarters and Anaheim distribution center for the foreseeable future. See Note 11. Item 14. Principal Accounting Services Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures The Audit Committee is required to pre-approve all auditing services and permissible non-audit services, including related fees and terms, to be performed for the Company by its independent auditor, subject to the de minimus exceptions for non-audit services described under the Exchange Act, which are approved by the Audit Committee prior to the completion of the audit. The Audit Committee also considers whether the provision by its independent accounting firm of any non-audit related services is compatible with maintaining the independence of such firm. For fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, the Audit Committee pre-approved all services performed for the Company by the auditor. Principal Accountant Fees During fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, the Company paid Haskell White LLP 244,500 and 252,000, respectively, for audit fees. Audit Fees Audit fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered in connection with the audit of the financial statements included in the Company s annual reports on Form 10-K and for the reviews of the unaudited financial statements included in the Company s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended during the years ended August 31, 2023 and 2022 and for other regulatory filings for such fiscal years. Other Fees There were no other fees billed by Haskell during fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022.
